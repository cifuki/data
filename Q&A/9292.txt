Q:I created two modules in single android project, named it x and y.


Module x has a class Egg (Package: com.example.x)
Module y has a class Foo (Package: com.example.y)


Now I want to import class Foo in the class Egg, for which I wrote the statement mentioned below in class Egg

Import com.example.y.Foo;


Now, Foo is not recognized by android.

Questions,


  Is it possible to import Class from a different module using just
  import statement?
  
  Do I need to create library of Module y and then import created
  library into module x?


Or may the solution is something else.

A:Make sure of the following: 

In settings.gradle, you should have: include ':x', ':y'.

In x/build.gradle, you should add y as a dependency: 

dependencies {
        compile project(':y')
        // other dependencies
}
