A:You can add the jar file in the android studio as follows:


Add a folder in your project named "Libs" and keep the jar files inside this folder , which you want to use in your project.
In the "Project->Project" view, You will be able to see the jar file from android studio (you may not see it in the "Project->android" view). Right click on the jar file and select the option "Add as Library" and Click Ok.
