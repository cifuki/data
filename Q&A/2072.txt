Could someone tell me which gets called first, is it onActivityResult() or is it onResume()?
Example:

Activity A calls startActivityForResult() to start Activity B. B executes, completes and returns a result to A, but which method of A is called first, onActivityResult() or onResume()?

I know someone has answered this question already by referring to the Activity Docs, however I couldn't find in there myself.

A:First calling onActivityResult() then onResume(). 

Quote from docs:


  protected void onActivityResult (int
  requestCode, int resultCode, Intent
  data)
  
  Since: API Level 1 Called when an
  activity you launched exits, giving
  you the requestCode you started it
  with, the resultCode it returned, and
  any additional data from it. The
  resultCode will be RESULT_CANCELED if
  the activity explicitly returned that,
  didn't return any result, or crashed
  during its operation. You will receive
  this call immediately before
  onResume() when your activity is
  re-starting.
