Q:When I attempt to navigate to the Android developer website, I am redirected to a version of it much of which is in Chinese. For instance, if I try to navigate to:

developer.android.com


I am redirected to:

http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/index.html


I want the English language site. In some cases, I've had to have web pages translated from Chinese. What am I doing wrong? How can I suppress this behavior?

A:While CommonsWare's answer will work just fine because removing the cookie will reset the language back to the default (English), the proper way to change the language of the Android Developer site to English is use the language spinner at the bottom of the page. This will set your preference and should retain it (by saving off the preference to the cookie).
