Q:I made a Horizontal RecyclerView and it works fine(thanks to this) but the direction of scroll and data are expand from left to right; then How can I change the RecyclerView scroll direction like in the picture below?



My Code:

StaggeredGridLayoutManager staggeredGridLayoutManager =
                new StaggeredGridLayoutManager(
                        2, //The number of Columns in the grid
                        LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL);

A:Assuming you use LinearLayoutManager in your RecyclerView, then you can pass true as third argument in the LinearLayoutManager constructor. 

For example:

mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this, LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, true));


If you are using the StaggeredGridLayoutManager, then you can use the setReverseLayout method it provides.
