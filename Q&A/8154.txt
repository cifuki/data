A:Disable "Build Automatically" on "Project Menu" and rebuild it manually (Right click on project -> Build project), then try to export the application again.

Eclipse seems to conflict with export and compile simultaneously. So every time you need to export an APK, disable automatic build. It's safe to use it any other time.
