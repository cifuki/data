Q:I am developing an Android application in which I want to publish as well as stream a video...

What I want is:


My app records a video and that video is sent to the server
The recorded video will be streamed live to another Android device at the same time..


I have completed the first task using javac and ffmpeg. I am stuck in the second task. I have searched a lot to stream the video from the server, but I didn't succeed. I don't want to use WebView and play the video in it. I want an RTMP player. This task has been completed in iOS... I want the same for Android. What is some link to fulfill my task?

P.S.:

I am using wowza server and RTMP stream. I would like to stream RTMP video (.flv)... If no solution is available, I would like to switch to RTSP and for that also, need a working link to follow..

Now I have switched to RTSP player [with wowza server] as I have not found an RTMP player without webview. How do I fix this issue?
