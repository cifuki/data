Q:I have run the setup ui, however, I get two different errors in the -html project than what is described in the tutorial: libgdx tutorial

The tutorial error stated is as follows (which is an error I do not see):


To fix the error of the HTML5/GWT project, go to the "Problems" view, right click the error message "The GWT SDK JAR gwt-servlet.jar is missing in the WEB-INF/lib directory" and select "Quick Fix". Click "Finish".


The errors I have are:


The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the class file for com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint. Fix the build path then try building this project   ...



The type com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files 


Is there anyway i can fix this? I just updated my eclipse, I also downloaded Version 18 ADT, revision 19 for Android SDK Tools, and revision 11 for Android SDK Platform-tools.

A:I had the same problem a couple of weeks ago and got around it by installing the GWT SDK.
