Q:I need to set the hint of a EditText as italic style, but I can't find any place how to do it. 

Some one here has a clue how to do it or do I have to accept that is impossible?

A:Inside strings.xml

 <string name="hint1"><i>Your hint here</i></string>


In your .xml file

  <EditText android:hint="@string/hint1" />
