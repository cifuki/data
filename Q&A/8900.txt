Q:I am using the Google Maps Android API and I'm running into some issues.

I am signing my apk with android studio (created one at .android/keystore.jks). Also I'm selecting "release" as type in it. I have used the command

keytool -list -v -keystore C:\\Users\\Toshiba\\.android\\keystore.jks


to get the SHA1 fingerprint out of the keystore.

The SHA1 is correct, but the Map is not shown on a signed APK. It is shown in a debug APK.

Using keytool with the release keystore (keystore.jks) will get me this:

 SHA1: 33:46:07:82:5B:D4:45:D2:60:CE:5A:29:97:9F:6C:44:XX:XX:XX:XX


The debug one works fine (I have added 2 to the API console in Google)

33:46:07:82:5B:D4:45:D2:60:CE:5A:29:97:9F:6C:44:XX:XX:XX:XX;yac.breakingpoint
7C:28:61:5B:C3:4A:5C:50:44:AA:FD:58:69:E9:70:91:XX:XX:XX:XX;yac.breakingpoint


XX is blacked out.

The keytool says it is using SHA256withRSA as signature algorithm for both, the debug and the release keystore.

What am I doing wrong?

UPDATE
So I've tried a new API key, clean project and rebuild it, new keystore - still not working on release... debug is fine!

UPDATE 2
Still not found a working solution... Help me!

UPDATE 3 Allright, got it working using a signed APK with build type debug. Extracted the CERT.RSA and runned keytool -printcert -file ./CERT.SA. Got the same result as for the release build type. In release it is not working!

UPDATE 4
Here's another try I made:


Created a new GIT Repository, commited to it.
The /buildfolders are not beeing commited since they are in the .gitignore files.
Created a new API key in the API console and added only the release SHA1 key to it.
Added that API key to the app and made a full clean with rebuild.
Generated a new signed APK file


It did not work.

UPDATE 5 
A friend of mine tried to reproduce this issue. He has the exact same issue when working with android studio. Probably a android studio bug?

A:You have two google_maps_api.xml files

One in this folder: 

app/src/debug/res/values 

Other in this folder:

app/src/release/res/values

But only the debug one contains your API key probably.
