Q:I'm trying to develop and app that overlays some information on a google map.

I was wondering, if it is possible to cache at least a portion of this map, so that it could be used offline.

A:You can use an OpenStreetMaps controller (like osmdroid) and Google Maps tiles. According to the Google Maps TOS (10.1.3.b), it seems that you can use a portion of maps if you cache it temporarily and securely. Read more at this tutorial.
