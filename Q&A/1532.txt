Q:In my application I would like to determine the user's current location. I do however have a couple of questions in this regard:


There are different Location Providers, which one is the most accurate? The GPS Provider or the Network Provider?
In how far do those available provider differ? How do they function?
Could you please provide me with some code-snippets or tutorials on how to get started with implementing GPS functionality in my application?

A:There are 3 location providers in Android. 
  
  They are:
  
  gps \xe2\x80\x93> (GPS, AGPS): Name of the GPS location provider. This
  provider determines location using satellites. Depending on
  conditions, this provider may take a while to return a location fix.
  Requires the permission android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.
  
  network \xe2\x80\x93> (AGPS, CellID, WiFi MACID): Name of the network
  location provider. This provider determines location based on
  availability of cell tower and WiFi access points. Results are
  retrieved by means of a network lookup. Requires either of the
  permissions android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or
  android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.
  
  passive \xe2\x80\x93> (CellID, WiFi MACID): A special location provider for
  receiving locations without actually initiating a location fix. This
  provider can be used to passively receive location updates when other
  applications or services request them without actually requesting the
  locations yourself. This provider will return locations generated by
  other providers. Requires the permission
  android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, although if the GPS is not
  enabled this provider might only return coarse fixes. This is what
  Android calls these location providers, however, the underlying
  technologies to make this stuff work is mapped to the specific set of
  hardware and telco provided capabilities (network service).
  
  The best way is to use the \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpassive\xe2\x80\x9d provider first,
  and then fallback on \xe2\x80\x9cgps\xe2\x80\x9d, and depending on the task, switch between
  providers. This covers all cases, and provides a lowest common
  denominator service (in the worst case) and great service (in the best
  case).

Now Android have Fused location provider

The Fused Location Provider intelligently manages the underlying location technology and gives you the best location according to your needs. It simplifies ways for apps to get the user\xe2\x80\x99s current location with improved accuracy and lower power usage

Fused location provider provide three ways to fetch location


Last Location: Use when you want to know current location once.
Request Location using Listener: Use when application is on screen / frontend and require continues location.
Request Location using Pending Intent: Use when application in background and require continues location.
