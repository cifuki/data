Q:I'm new to Android and I've seen example code using these annotations. For example:

@SmallTest
public void testStuff() {
    TouchUtils.tapView(this, anEditTextView);
    sendKeys("H E L P SPACE M E PERIOD");
    assertEquals("help me.", anEditTextView.getText().toString());
}


What does that annotation accomplish?

A:This blog post explains it best.  Basically, it is the following:




Small: this test doesn't interact with any file system or network.
Medium:  Accesses file systems on box which is running tests.
Large: Accesses external file systems, networks, etc.


Per the Android Developers blog, a small test should take < 100ms, a medium test < 2s, and a large test < 120s.

See this page (search for "@SmallTest") on how to specify which tests get run.
