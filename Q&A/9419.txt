Q:I have a Phonegap app which works perfectly in Android. I chose Phonegap as a platform mainly because the same code can be used for Android, iPhone, etc.. My question is though, how can I create iPhone app without actually having Apple hardware (iPhone + Mac) as I am having Windows notebook and HTC Desire HD and I am happy with it :-) My app for iPhone will be free so there is no possibility the app itself with compensate for the money for Apple HW. 
 Can you please sum up some options I have how to deploy ready Phonegap app for iPhone ? Or what is the cheapest real option - e.g. buy used iPhone and some kind of used Mac ?
