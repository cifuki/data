Q:How do I turn on/off 'do not disturb' (dnd) programmatically in Android?  Is was hoping this would give me something but it doesn't:

Settings.System.putInt(getContentResolver(), Settings.System.DO_NOT_DISTURB, 1);

A:I found this solution:

NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
        mNotificationManager.setInterruptionFilter(NotificationManager.INTERRUPTION_FILTER_NONE);


It requires:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY" />


Which as far as I can tell does not pop up a request dialog when doing requestPermissions(). It has to be granted through the settings menu Settings -> Sound & Notifcation -> Do Not Disturb Access.

This is on SDK 23 Marshmallow.
