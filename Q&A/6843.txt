Q:Is it possible to get and watch at Android's program component's native methods code. If anyone knows how to, please let me know.

A:You can find source code for Android native methods using Google Code Search one of the following services:


AndroidXRef
GitHub (using repo:android/* search term)


The search for "SystemClock || android*SystemClock" in AndroidXref will point you to the android_os_SystemClock.cpp file which in turn forwards many of its methods to SystemClock.cpp  

Other Android .cpp or .h files with native methods implementations could be found in a similar way.
