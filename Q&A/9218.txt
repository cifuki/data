A:I think you have this issue because the app is installed on your device with a different signature.

When you do cordova run android, the app is installed with a debug signature and maybe that signature changed when you changed target sdk or when you upgraded android.

The fix when you have INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE error is to first uninstall your app and then you should not have the issue any-more when launching cordova run android
