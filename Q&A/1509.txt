Q:I see there a lot of similar topics pertaining to this issue but I did not find a solution for me among those posts. I just installed Android Studio v0.8.14 and it won't let me create a new project because I do not have an SDK path specified. For the life of me I cannot find where that path should be. I see many people have it located in C:/Android or someplace similar, however the only Android files I have are on my desktop in the extracted folder that came in the .zip. All paths inside that folder do not qualify as an appropriate SDK location, according to Android Studio. Am I being completely ridiculous and missing the obvious?

A:Download the SDK from here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/ to C:\\android-sdk\\.

Then when you launch Android Studio again, it will prompt you for the SDK path just point it to: C:\\android-sdk\\.

Update: new download location, https://developer.android.com/studio/#command-tools
