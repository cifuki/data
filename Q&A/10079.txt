Q:I am setting a compound drawable to a TextView like so

txtView1.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(R.drawable.icon, 0, 0,0);


The drawable is drawn to the left most position of the TextView. However I want to move it a little bit so that it doesn't sit on the left border of the TextView but it's like 10dip inside. I did some padding by using:

android:paddingLeft="10dip"


But this pushes the text to move along with the compound drawable to the right by 10dip.

How do I move only the compound drawable by 10dip without affecting the text ?

A:Its very simple. Just add the following piece code to your TextView

android:drawablePadding="10dip"


This adds padding between your text and the image in the TextView.
