Q:I have the Android SDK installed on both a Linux machine using open SuSE 12.1. I've used both machines to successfully build Android apps many times and sign them both with a debug key for testing and a release key from my own keystore, so it should be somewhere on each machine.

Using the command

jarsigner


Returns a command not found error on both machines, however. I've looked in the Android SDK folder, JDK folder on Windows, and /usr/lib64/jvm/ but it's not anywhere I've looked.

I assume it must be under a different name. I've also run:

 find -name jarsigner


over the whole system on the Linux box with no success.

A:It's in the bin folder of your java JDK install (Java SE). If you only have the JRE installed you probably don't have it.
