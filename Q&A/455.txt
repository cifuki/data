Q:I'm trying to generate a custom dialog in Android. 
I create my Dialog like this:

dialog = new Dialog(this);
dialog.setContentView(R.layout.my_dialog);


Everythings works fine except for the title of the Dialog.
Even if I don't set the title of the dialog the dialog popup has a blank space at the position of the dialog. 

Is there any way to hide this part of the Dialog? 

I tried it with an AlertDialog but it seems the layout is not set properly: 

LayoutInflater inflater = 
    (LayoutInflater) this.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.map_dialog, null);

AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
builder.setView(view);

// dialog = new Dialog(this);
// dialog.setContentView(R.layout.map_dialog);

dialog = builder.create();

((TextView) dialog.findViewById(R.id.nr)).setText(number);


If I use this code I get a null Pointer Exception in the last line.  The dialog is not null so the TextView I try to retrieve does not exist.
If I uncomment the part where I use the Dialog Constructor everything works fine but for the title above my dialog layout.

A:You can hide the title of a dialog using:

dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);



Previous version of this answer, which is overcomplicated:

You need to use an AlertDialog. There's a good explanation on the Android Developer's site about custom dialogs.

In very short summary, you do this with code like copied below from the official website. That takes a custom layot file, inflates it, gives it some basic text and icon, then creates it. You'd show it then with alertDialog.show().

AlertDialog.Builder builder;
AlertDialog alertDialog;

Context mContext = getApplicationContext();
LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater)
        mContext.getSystemService(LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
View layout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.custom_dialog,
        (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.layout_root));

TextView text = (TextView) layout.findViewById(R.id.text);
text.setText("Hello, this is a custom dialog!");
ImageView image = (ImageView) layout.findViewById(R.id.image);
image.setImageResource(R.drawable.android);

builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(mContext);
builder.setView(layout);
alertDialog = builder.create();


In response to comment:

I assume that TextView with the id nr is in the View you are inflating with View view = inflater..... If so, then you need to change just one bit: instead of dialog.findView... make it view.findView.... Then once you've done that, remember to use dialog.show(), or even builder.show() without bothering to do builder.create().
