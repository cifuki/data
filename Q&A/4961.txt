Q:I'm calling finish() but my activity keeps on going.

I have an activity which is invoked by a menu from the main activity screen.  In my activity's onCreate() method I have the following code fragment:

    // Make sure there are some events in the list.
    if (theEventArrayList.isEmpty()){
        Toast.makeText(this, "Event List is empty", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        finish();
    }
    SummarizeCurrentEvent();
    graphEvents();


If the list is empty it puts up the Toast, and I can set breakpoint on the call to finish(). If I step from that in the debugger it goes to straight to SummarizeCurrentEvent().   I thought finish() would exit the activity. Is this not the case? Where can I find out more information about this method?

A:You should put a return statement after that finish, because the method that called finish will be executed completely otherwise.
