Q:I have a vertical, set height (300px) LinearLayout (LL) with 3 nested LLs. 1 and 3rd are set with android:layout_height="wrap_content" and the middle one with android:layout_height="fill_parent". To my dismay, 3rd LL gets pushed out with 2nd one filling parent layout right to the bottom. How do I achieve desired effect since I want potentially resize the outside container with the middle portion expanding and contracting to accommodate the change

A:Turned out (Thanks Mark Murphy for the answer) that all I was looking for was to set middle row to

layout_height="0px" and layout_weight="1"


  If, after all the wrap_content and fixed-sized items are allocated for 
  along an axis (horizontal or vertical), there is still room on that axis 
  left over, LinearLayout then allocates the remaining space to those 
  widgets with specified weights, in proportion to the weight.
