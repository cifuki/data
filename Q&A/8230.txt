Q:Is there any way of using Android emulator on High Sierra (10.13)? 

When I run

./HAXM\\ installation -u


It says:

HAXM silent installation only supports macOS from 10.8 to 10.12 !

A:The command line installation doesn't work and gives unsupported mac os version error, while the installation through IntelHAXM_6.2.1.mpkg works but kext is not loaded due to "Approved Kernel Extension Loading" changes,

So you will need to allow the extensions from Intel and restart your mac,
then launch the emulator like from inside Android Studio,

To enable go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy as shown in the screenshot:
