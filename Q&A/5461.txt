Q:I have a pretty basic load image from server line code:

Glide.with(view.getContext()).load(url).placeholder(R.drawable.default_profile).into(view);

For some reason, I'm always stuck with the placeholder being displayed and never the real image!

I have made sure that a valid and working url is being passed. And, if I use the same code without the placeholder it works fine

Glide.with(view.getContext()).load(url).into(view);

Any ideas why?

A:try to add .dontAnimate() 
It caused by TransitionDrawable too and it seems so becuase after scroll there's no animation because it's cached.
the correct code is 

Glide.with(view.getContext()).load(url).placeholder(R.drawable.default_profile).dontAnimate().into(view);


I hope to be helpful for you
