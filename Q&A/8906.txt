Q:I'm very new to Android development and have never used Android Studio before. I set it up, got my app working on my phone and left it alone for a few weeks. Upon returning, I could not find the Android Studio executable on my computer, so I reinstalled it and restarted on the same project. 

Not sure if this has to do with the AVD Manager button being grayed out. Things I have tried:


Making sure my SDK path is correct
Running Android Studio as administrator
Launching the AVD Manager executable from windows. I can create a virtual device but doesn't affect disabled AVD Manager button when restarting Android Studio.
Installing Intel X86 Atom System Image and Google APIs in SDK Manager, under API 24.Everything under API 25 is installed.


Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

A:This generally happens when Android Studio is not able identify the android sdk installation in the machine. This could happen if Android Studio is launched in non-Administrator mode.

Just close and relaunch Android Studio in administrator mode. You will see a saying "android framework is identified" Click on the configure link on that notification. The AndroidStudio will start configuring the android sdk. After some time the buttons would be visible and enabled.
