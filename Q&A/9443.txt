Q:I am using Firebase Authentication in an Android application, and I am using Google account authentication as an option to sign in to the application.

How can I know if the user is signed in to the application for the first time or not?

A:To check if it's the first time user logs in, simply call the AdditionalUserInfo.isNewUser() method in the OnCompleteListener.onComplete callback.

Example code below, be sure to check for null.

OnCompleteListener<AuthResult> completeListener = new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
        @Override
        public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
            if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                boolean isNew = task.getResult().getAdditionalUserInfo().isNewUser();
                Log.d("MyTAG", "onComplete: " + (isNew ? "new user" : "old user"));
            }
        }
    };
