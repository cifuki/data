Q:I have a method(getContacts) that returns a List and I need to convert this result to a MutableList. Currently the best way I can think of doing it is like this:

val contacts: MutableList<Contact> = ArrayList(presenter.getContacts())


Is there a more idiomatic/"less Java" way to do that?

A:Consider using the toMutableList() function:

presenter.getContacts().toMutableList()


There are toMutableList() extensions for the stdlib types that one might want to convert to a mutable list: Collection<T>, Iterable<T>, Sequence<T>, CharSequence, Array<T> and primitive arrays.
