Q:My app needs to be in portrait mode so I set it in the manifest by:

android:screenOrientation="portrait"


But I just recently added another fragment (FragA) that just looks and functions 10x better in landscape.  Is there something I can put inside of my FragA to just make that fragment in landscape while retaining the rest of the app in portrait or by doing this will I have to add something to my other fragments to keep them retained as portrait?

A:Orientation attribute is per activity so you can declare the orientation for only the activity  that contains the fragment so that it is in landscape and the rest of the activities will remain as they are.
