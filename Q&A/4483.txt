Q:So, I'm watching this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6YdwzAvwOA and Romain Guy is showing how to make more efficient UI adapter code using the getView() method. Does this apply to CursorAdapters as well? I'm currently using bindView() and newView() for my custom cursor adapters. Should I be using getView instead?

A:CursorAdapter has an implementation of getView() that delegates to newView() and bindView(), in such a way as enforces the row recycling pattern. Hence, you do not need to do anything special with a CursorAdapter for row recycling if you are overriding newView() and bindView().
