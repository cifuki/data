Q:I am trying to take a picture using an intent. My problem is that sometimes after taking a picture my activity, which calls startActivityForResult, seems to be destroyed so that onCreate is called again.

Here is my code for taking pictures after clicking an imageview, which image should be replaced:

if (!getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(
                PackageManager.FEATURE_CAMERA)) {
            Util.makeLongToast(R.string.lang_no_camera);
        } else {
            Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);
            startActivityForResult(intent, TAKE_ITEM_PHOTO);
        }


...

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    Log.v(TAG, "onactivityresult called");
    if (requestCode == TAKE_ITEM_PHOTO) {
        if (data != null) {

            imageUri = data.getData();


                try {
                    img_photo.setImageBitmap(Media.getBitmap(
                            getContentResolver(), imageUri));
            } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
                    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }

        } else
            Log.w(TAG, "data is null");
    }
}


So all i try is to take a picture and replace the image of an imageview with it. But in some cases onCreate is called after onActivityResult was called and the new image is lost.

Help is greatly appreciated.

A:Actually the camera causes the orientation change in your activity that is why your activity is being destroyed and recreated.

Add this in your manifest file it will prevent the orientation change and your activity will not get destroyed and recreated.  

<activity
    android:name=".YourActivity"
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|screenSize"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait" >
</activity>
