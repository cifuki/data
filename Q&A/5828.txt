Q:In the newest version of ADT (version 20 preview 3), they say that it's possible to make the libraries' manifest file become mergeable with projects that use them:


  Automatic merging of library project manifest files into the including
  project's manifest. Enable with the manifestmerger.enabled property.


How and where do I use it? I can't see content assist helping with me on this anywhere.
