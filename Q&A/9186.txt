A:I know that using solid black color logcat in Android Studio is awful!!!

Here is my best practice colour codes that you can use for changing the face of you logcat in Android Studio to make it more useful.

Go to Android Studio Preferences and search for logcat and 'Save As' your own scheme:

Assert: 9C27B0

Debug: 2196F3

Error: F44336

Info: 4CAF50

Warning: FFC107





All colors are picked carefully from google Material Design palette and can help you with more readability in both Default and Darcula theme:
