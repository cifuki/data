Q:I am having some trouble getting an options menu working in Android. I build apps before, and they all worked fine, but now the menu just doesn't pop up.

The code: 

@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);

    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_video, menu);
    return true;
}


the whole method is never even called (checked by setting a breakpoint). The activity is super-simple, it just has a VideoView in it, with an OnTouchListener set. 

I am using Android 4.0.4 on a Samsung Galaxy 10.1, API level 15, minSDK 15. Am I missing something?

A:If the phone you test on has a menu button onCreateOptionsMenu wont't be called on start with the theme:

android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar"

But when you click the menu button the onCreateOptionsMenu will be called. I don't know what happens on phones without hardware buttons...
