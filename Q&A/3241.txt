Q:I have an app with a ViewPager and three Fragments. I'm trying to figure out how to get the current Fragment being viewed so I can get at its arguments. 

I have an OnPageChangeListener grabbing the current page index, but 

ViewPager.getChildAt(int position);


returns a View. What's the relationship between this View and the current Fragment?

A:I finally found an answer that worked for me.  Basically, you can access the fragment for a viewPager page by using the tag "android:switcher:"+R.id.viewpager+":0".
