Q:I'm having issues trying to boot-up Android Studio

When I try to launch it after installation I'm getting this error:

No JVM Installation found. Please install a 64 bit JDK.



My current system specification:  

Operating System: Windows 8.0 64 bit version
JDK installed: JDK 1.8.0  



What I have tried:  

I have tried what was reported in the error, and also in most of the solutions to set the JDK_HOME variable in environment variables to my JDK path (64 bit version) i.e. C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_05  

*I also have tried rebooting system, just in case to test if the environment variable is not working without a restart



I have seen these solutions and tried but none of them works, so don't mark it as a duplicate of any of these:
Android Studio installation on Windows 7 fails, no JDK found
With android studio no jvm found, JAVA_HOME has been set
Android Studio start fails on Windows 8 64bit
Android Studio does not launch after installation



Here is the cmd output for java version:

A:I had the same problem. I tried setting all kind of paths but nothing worked. So I had to do some dirty fix. The only problem with this is that it opens a blank command line window.

I did the following to make it work.


goto the AndroidStudio installation folder.
goto bin folder and open studio.bat in text editor
add set JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java2\\jdk1.8.0//your java path after the ECHO line.
goto Start -> All Programmes -> Android Studio -> 
right click on Android Studio and click on properties.
You will see the Target something like <installation path>android-studio\\bin\\studio64.exe
change it to <installation path>android-studio\\bin\\studio.bat


Now you can access it by clicking it from the menu.

Note : I tried it with 8, It works.
