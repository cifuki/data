Q:I am using the new android.support.design.widget.BottomNavigationView from the support library.
How can I set the current selection from code? I realized, that the selection is changed back to the first item, after rotating the screen. Of course it would also help, if someone could tell me, how to "save" the current state of the BottomNavigationView in the onPause function and how to restore it in onResume.

Thanks!

A:From API 25.3.0 it was introduced the method setSelectedItemId(int id) which let's you mark an item as selected as if it was tapped.

From docs:


  Set the selected menu item ID. This behaves the same as tapping on an item.


Code example:

BottomNavigationView bottomNavigationView;
bottomNavigationView = (BottomNavigationView) findViewById(R.id.bottomNavigationView);
bottomNavigationView.setOnNavigationItemSelectedListener(myNavigationItemListener);
bottomNavigationView.setSelectedItemId(R.id.my_menu_item_id);


IMPORTANT

You MUST have already added all items to the menu and set the Listener before calling setSelectedItemId so that the BottomNavigationView can run the corresponding code's behaviour. If you call setSelectedItemId before adding the menu items and setting the listener nothing will happen.
