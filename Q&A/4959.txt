Q:In the latest update for Android studio, the emulator has started saving snapshots of the current state of the device by default and going back to that snapshot when reopened, which is not the behavior that I want. How can I disable that and go back to the previous behavior, where it just closes and resets the emulator?

UI after hitting the X button to close



Android Studio 3.0.1, with Emulator version 27.0.2 and HAXM 6.2.1

A:disable that and go back to the previous behavior


Unselect quick boot as shown below

This is default behaviour from update of Android Studio 3.0

Please unselect quick boot if you don't want to save state and select cold boot

Check quick boot emulator in details


  Steps
  
  1> Choose device like phone - pixel 2
  
  2> select your system image
  
  3> Verify configuration - show advance setting - emulator performance
  check cold boot to disable 
  
  4> Finish




OR

you can also change it from 


  Emulator --> More --> Settings --> Change quick-boot state --> Save
