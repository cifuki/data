Q:What is the difference between setImageBitmap and setImageDrawable?

I have an image which I would like to set dynamically from file. The tutorial that I followed says to convert my Bitmap to a BitmapDrawable then set it using setImageDrawable. I've notice that setting the Bitmap directly with setImageBitmap also works but I don't notice any difference.

Bitmap image = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imgFile.getAbsolutePath());
BitmapDrawable bitmapDrawable = new BitmapDrawable(image);
imageView.setImageDrawable(bitmapDrawable);


OR

Bitmap image = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imgFile.getAbsolutePath());
imageView.setImageBitmap(image);

A:There is no difference between the two internally setImageBitmap is calling setImageDrawable.

Below code is picked from ImageView.java of AOSP

public void setImageBitmap(Bitmap bm) {
    // if this is used frequently, may handle bitmaps explicitly
    // to reduce the intermediate drawable object
    setImageDrawable(new BitmapDrawable(mContext.getResources(), bm));
}
