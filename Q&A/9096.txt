Q:I have an android application that consists of a WebWiew and I need to login to a site automatically using code. I've tried using postUrl() and it seems to work... but only on some sites.

Here's the code I'm using:

public class webviewActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        WebView webview = new WebView(this);
        setContentView(webview);
        WebSettings webSettings = webview.getSettings();
        webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);

        webview.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());

        String postData = "login_email=myEmail@gmail.com&login_password=myPassword";
        webview.postUrl("https://www.dropbox.com/login", EncodingUtils.getBytes(postData, "utf-8"));
    }
}


This Works great for dropbox.com, but other sites like google.com, facebook.com, etc. just load the login page or give an error (google.com gives an error saying I need to enable cookies).

Right now I'm just going the post data by hand; looking at the login form for the site and putting the name/value fields in the postData in my code. On sites like google, the login form has many hidden fields and I've been adding those to the postData also.

If anyone could give me any idea of something I'm doing wrong please let me know, I'm pretty confused about this.

A:Try replacing "utf-8" (in the 2nd param) with "BASE64".
