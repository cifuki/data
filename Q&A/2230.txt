Q:After upgrading to appcompat 25.1.0 I've started getting wired errors.

In my code:

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);


I get lint error:

AppCompatActivity.onCreate can only be called from within the same library group (groupId=com.android.support)

How to prevent such behavior?

A:As Felipe already pointed out in his comment this is a bug in the pre-release version of the tools.

You can workaround it for now, until Google release a fix, by adding the following into your project module's build.gradle file:  

android {
  lintOptions {
    disable 'RestrictedApi'
  }
}


It's worth noting that this may hide true errors in your project as it suppresses all errors of that type, so the better option would be to downgrade the version of Android Studio and the tools used in the project.
