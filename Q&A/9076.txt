Q:Is it enough to declare <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /> or do I also have to declare <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />?  The Javadocs omit this important information.

A:READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE only exists as of Jelly Bean (Level 16). According to the docs, all applications as of Jelly Bean have that permission, even without declaring it:


  Provides protected read access to external storage. In Android 4.1 by
  default all applications still have read access. This will be changed
  in a future release to require that applications explicitly request
  read access using this permission. If your application already
  requests write access, it will automatically get read access as well.
  There is a new developer option to turn on read access restriction,
  for developers to test their applications against how Android will
  behave in the future.


So, you should declare it for future compatibility, but this might not be the source of your problem, unless you're using a Jelly Bean phone and set the developer option "Protect USB storage" option.
