Q:An android mobile actually does know quite well where it is - but is there a way of retrieving the country by something like a country code?

No need of knowing the exact GPS position - the country is sufficient 

I first thought of using the time zone, but actually I need more information than that since it makes a difference if the location is New York or Lima.

The background of the question: I have an application that uses temperature values, and I'd like to set the default unit either to Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on whether the location is US or outside

A:This will get the country code set for the phone (phones language, NOT user location):

 String locale = context.getResources().getConfiguration().locale.getCountry(); 


can also replace getCountry() with getISO3Country() to get a 3 letter ISO code for the country. This will get the country name:

 String locale = context.getResources().getConfiguration().locale.getDisplayCountry();


This seems easier than the other methods and rely upon the localisation settings on the phone, so if a US user is abroad they probably still want Fahrenheit and this will work :) 

Editors note: This solution has nothing to do with the location of the phone. It is constant. When you travel to Germany locale will NOT change. In short: locale != location.
