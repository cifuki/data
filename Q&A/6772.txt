Q:I just bought a Galaxy Nexus, now I got a problem, my ADB doesn't recognize it. The Point is when I connect it, it shows it as Storage-Device on my Computer but it isn't listed as an ADB Device.

When I connect my other Phone (HTC Desire HD) it recognize it without any problems.

Some information about the System and Config:


I'm on Win7 Service Pack 1 64bit
Galaxy Nexus is in debugging mode
The Device isn't shown in ADB but Windows recognize it as Massstoragedevice
Eclipse and Googlepack is updated to the newest Version

A:Check if you have installed this package in your ADB "Google USB Driver package, revision 4"; if not do it. 

Another possible solution could be downloading the drivers from here: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SCH-I515MSAVZW

This appears to work for the Samsung GT-i9250 version too.
