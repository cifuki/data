Q:Consider this as a wiki question.

While I setup my project to support Map V2, There has been a step to add MAPS_RECEIVE permission.

<permission
          android:name="com.example.mapdemo.permission.MAPS_RECEIVE"
          android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
<uses-permission android:name="com.example.mapdemo.permission.MAPS_RECEIVE"/>


Why we creating and consuming the permission from the app itself?

Is that google play services app interact using this permission ?

This permission can't takes care of these things?

<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES"/>


I thought the use of custom permission is to allow other apps to launch/use our app's services/resources.

A:For future visitors:


  This permission is now completely unnecessary. The latest update of
  Google Play Services 3.1.59 made it useless. As a result, it can be
  removed.
