When i updated my android studio today from version 2.2.3 to 2.3 i suddenly got this error in my build.gradle on the first compile line in dependencies

(It doesnt matter which dependencie will be at the first place but it will always give me this error):


  All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 25.2.0, 24.0.0. Examples include com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.2.0 and com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0


i have looked through my entire project and i can not find any usage of versions 24.0.0 (I have looked with ctrl + shift + F to search in entire project)

this is my build.gradle:

android {
    compileSdkVersion 25
    buildToolsVersion '25.0.2'
    useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 25
        versionName "1.0"
        versionCode 1
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.txt'
        }
        debug {
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
        }
    }
    dexOptions {
        javaMaxHeapSize "4g"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs')
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.2.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:+'
    compile 'com.squareup:otto:1.3.8'
    compile 'com.mcxiaoke.volley:library-aar:1.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.1'
}

A:i have looked through my entire project and i can not find any usage of versions 24.0.0


It is coming as a transitive dependency from one of your other dependencies.

First, though, fix the other issues in your build.gradle file, as they may clear up this problem as well:


Do not use + for a library version. Use a specific version.
Do not use play-services. Use the specific dependencies for the specific pieces of the Play Services SDK that you want. play-services brings in all of Play Services, making your app much bigger than it needs to be and slowing down your build times a lot.
Replace com.mcxiaoke.volley with the official Volley artifact (com.android.volley:volley:1.0.0)


If none of those clear up the issue, you can run a Gradle dependency report to see what your full tree of dependencies are. From there, you will see which one of your libraries is asking for a different version of the Android Support libraries. For whatever it is asking for, you can ask for it directly with the 25.2.0 version, or use Gradle's other conflict resolution approaches to arrange to get the same version.
