Q:Let's say I want all the TextView instances in my app to have textColor="#ffffff". Is there a way to set that in one place instead of setting it for each TextView?

A:Actually, you can set a default style for TextViews (and most other built-in widgets) without needing to do a custom java class or setting the style individually.

If you take a look in themes.xml in the Android source, you will see a bunch of attributes for the default style for various widgets. The key is the textViewStyle (or editTextStyle, etc.) attribute which you override in your custom theme. You can override these in the following way:

Create a styles.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
<style name="MyTheme" parent="android:Theme">
    <item name="android:textViewStyle">@style/MyTextViewStyle</item>
</style>

<style name="MyTextViewStyle" parent="android:Widget.TextView">
    <item name="android:textColor">#F00</item>
    <item name="android:textStyle">bold</item>
</style>
</resources>


Then just apply that theme to your application in AndroidManifest.xml:

<application [\xe2\x80\xa6] android:theme="@style/MyTheme">\xe2\x80\xa6


And all your text views will default to the style defined in MyTextViewStyle (in this instance, bold and red)!

This was tested on devices from API level 4 onward and seems to work great.
