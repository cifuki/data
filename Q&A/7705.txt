Q:can someone help me find the refresh layout button which was there before studio 2.2 to refresh the layout changes?

Have searched every where but cannot find it.The problem is sometimes drawables are not refreshed and reflected in the preview window.

A:I think it is a small bug, but I find a hack solution to resolve the problem.

You can change a resource id to a wrong name. For example, you have a resource named ic_launcher. When you input ic_launcher1, you can find the interface like this:



Next, click the refresh link (sometimes, it says 'clear cache').

I tried changing the orientation, but it does not work when I replace an existing image file.
