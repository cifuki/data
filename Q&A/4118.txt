Q:Google recently released the android.support.design.widget.NavigationView widget as part of the com.android.support:design:22.2.0 library, which greatly simplified (and standardises) the process of creating a NavigationDrawer.

However according to the design specs, the list item should be Roboto Medium, 14sp, 87% #000000. The NavigationView exposes no textSize or textStyle to customise this.




What are my options if I'm pedantic about maintaining the correct design specifications using the Google provided NavigationView (or customising it in any other way)?

A:Since Android Support Library 22.2.1, Google has changed default textSize of items in NavigationView from 16sp to 14sp, which suits Material Design guideline well. However, in some cases(for example, when you want to support Chinese language), it seems larger textSize is better. Solution is simple:


add app:theme="@style/yourStyle.Drawer" to your NavigationView in your layout.xml
in styles.xml, add android:textSize="16sp" in style yourStyle.Drawer
