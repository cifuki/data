Q:I read many documents regarding to Phonegap and Sencha Touch. But i still confused with these two.

I have already created one native android application. Now, i want to create same application which run on multiple device. So, i am confused with these two frameworks.


Which is the best one from these two to use and why ?
What is the difference between Phonegap and Sencha Touch ?

A:What is the difference between Phonegap and Sencha Touch ?

Sencha Touch is a full and rich framework for creating mobile user interfaces and related data modelling, server communications and business logic. Like Sencha ExtJS for desktop/tablet apps, you code most of the app using a clean MVC design based on Javascript classes. HTML is generated by these classes that treats HTML like an assembly language. This abstracts the differences/bugs/qwerks between the various mobile platform browsers and browser versions saving the developer from most of the pain that HTML based solutions exhibit. Instead the developer assembles higher-level components that provide features such as data modelling and collection binding, drag/drop and UI animations. You also get smooth scrolling and auto data pre-fetching of potentially infinite data collections while internally delivering optimised DOM performance through DOM element reuse. This is made possible because you no longer code the HTML or XML directly, rather Javascript classes create/destroy/recycle DOM elements for you. You can still customise components using HTML templates. 

ExtJS 5 now supports ViewModels (MVVM) and so its anticipated that Sencha Touch 3.x will also.

You can use Sencha Touch to create web applications that look and feel like mobile apps OR you can compile them into native apps that ship with either a PhoneGap native wrapper or Sencha's own native wrapper.  Sencha is focusing future efforts on the PhoneGap native wrapper over it's own and provides several device related classes that integrate with the PhoneGap APIs and sometimes provides simulations of these APIs when PhoneGap is not loaded (e.g. testing in a desktop browser).

PhoneGap provides a bridge for Javascript code to call native device features (like Digital compass, Microphone, Camera, Battery, Device capabilities/status, File system etc). These are provided via PhoneGap plugins that are re-implemented with identical Javascript interfaces on each OS platform. Plugins may or may not integrate with these hardware or other operating system features (e.g. Barcode scanning plugins use the Camera, while SQLite database engine accesses the local filesystem).  PhoneGap ships with several standard plugins but there are currently 550+ Cordova plugins registered. 

The PhoneGap team have looked to the future where some of these hardware APIs are making their way into browser APIs and sought to follow the emerging standards in order to ensure as smooth as possible transition for developers as this trend emerges. 

Which is the best one from these two to use and why ?

Hopefully you'll now see that they are not competing but rather complimentary technologies that are frequently used together.  

You can develop simple PhoneGap apps that don't rely on any other frameworks but today most mobile developers will use PhoneGap with one of the following popular javascript frameworks that do compete with each other: AngularJS, Kendo UI, jQuery Mobile or Sencha Touch.

What's the difference between Cordova and PhoneGap ?

You didn't ask this but it needs answering in this context.  The best answer is here. 

What is the difference between Sencha Touch and Sencha Touch 2 ?

The original Sencha Touch 1.x and Sencha ExtJS 4.1 are now both deprecated but both used an earlier Javascript class model. Sencha Touch 1.x also lacked many other features including integration with PhoneGap and the new Sencha Command build system. 

Sencha Touch 2.x brought in a new smarter and leaner class design that has recently been fully adopted by the ExtJS 5.x .  ExtJS 5.x also brings View Models (MVVM to replace MVC) that we expect will be in (yet to be released) Sencha Touch 3.x 

If you plan to use PhoneGap and Sencha Touch together, you might also be interested in Sencha Touch Live, a free open source app I created that will significantly boost your productivity. With a single command it can create, compile, deploy and run a new app on a device (or device emulator/simulator). You can then "live edit" the Sencha Touch code one or more device/emulators. You just save the file and it reloads the app onto the devices. It even auto compiles your SCCS files into CCS. So you rarely need to recompile/redeploy/rerun or restart debuggers, just edit and save and immediately view the results on multiple devices. Unlike PhoneGap Developer App it was based on, you can use any of the PhoneGap plugins.  Tons of other cool features to enjoy!
