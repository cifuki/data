Q:According to the beginner guide, to setup the ADT Plugin, one of the procedures is

http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing


  For the SDK Location in the main
  panel, click Browse... and locate your
  downloaded SDK directory.


I went to Program Files, found Android directory, but none of those works.
Upon research, I found out that Android developers have warned me to take note of the SDK directory, which I didn't. 

Now my question is, how do I get that directory path? I don't want to reinstall the SDK, and then install the updates (lots of mess...)

Thanks for the help!



Edited

That exe that you guys wanted me to look for is indeed inside platform-tools.

I installed Android SDK, and it gives me Android SDK Manager. So I am guessing I had the right thing installed on my PC.

A:You can search your hard drive for one of the programs that's installed with the SDK. For instance, if you search for aapt.exe or adb.exe, they will be in the platform-tools directory underneath the installation directory (which is what you're after).
