Q:I'm just having trouble with getting my emulator SD card work...
I created a new AVD device with a new SD card.

So how to put data onto it? I found the "correct" file to be mounted on Daemon tools, but is corrupt or simply not readable... 

It would be great if you have any idea :)

A:If you are using Eclipse you can move files to and from the SD Card through the Android Perspective (it is called DDMS in Eclipse). Just select the Emulator in the left part of the screen and then choose the File Explorer tab. Above the list with your files should be two symbols, one with an arrow pointing at a phone, clicking this will allow you to choose a file to move to phone memory.
