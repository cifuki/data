Q:Ohoy.  As Im upgrading my app to L, I replaced ActionBars with Toolbars and whenever I start an ActionMode now it pushes down all the content. (I suppose this is because the ActionBar is once again shown in order to display the ActionMode.) Is it possible to display the ActionMode as an overlay, or have it reside within the Toolbar?

Also no styling options seem to apply to it, which makes me wonder whether theres a new way to style it. Any ideas?

Im using AppCompat V7 21 and so far Ive tried windowActionModeOverlay=true and toolbar.startActionMode(..)

A:Use <item name="windowActionModeOverlay">true</item> in your app theme (without android:).
