Q:I need to implement Dialog for my Android app through Java code, so I can't use XML.

I have root LinearLayout where I implement range seek bar, then I have another LinearLayout under root layout, with horizontal orientation, where I want to add two buttons in same row. So I need to set weight to 1, and width to FILL_PARENT and height to WRAP_CONTENT.

How I can do that with Java code?

A:LinearLayout.LayoutParams p = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
p.weight = 1;

rangeSeekBar.setLayoutParams(p);


I'm not sure which view you want to set the layout params on. I just assumed the rangeSeekbar to show an example. Change if you need.

When using the layout params always use the root's param type..

Ex. if you have a View you want to apply params to within a RelativeLayout use RelativeLayout.LayoutParams..
