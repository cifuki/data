Q:In the newest version of ADT (r17) a generated constant was added BuildConfig.DEBUG that is set according to the build type. The problem I have is that it is never set to false, I expected it to change when doing "Android Tools -> Export Signed Application Package" but it hasn't for me. 

So how do I change the build type?


  Added a feature that allows you to run some code only in debug mode.
  Builds now generate a class called BuildConfig containing a DEBUG
  constant that is automatically set according to your build type. You
  can check the (BuildConfig.DEBUG) constant in your code to run
  debug-only functions

A:Currently you can get the correct behavior by disabling "Build Automatically", cleaning the project and then export via "Android Tools -> Export Signed Application Package". When you run the application BuildConfig.DEBUG should be false.
