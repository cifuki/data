Q:I am trying to create a Cordova project. After creating the project cordova create myProject I would like to open it in Android Studio. The problem is ... it doesn't work. 

The CordovaLib will not build with various errors package android.* does not exist.

Does anyone know how to import a cordova project in Android Studio?

A:Unfortunately the accepted answer is a bit out of date. Using Cordova v5.3.3 (it probably works on all versions > 5) it is much the same process a building and then entering XCode for an iOS application now - the build system has moved to gradle.

Before opening in Android Studio

cordova build android


Then just open up the project using File > Open and pointing to the (yourProjectDir)/Platforms/Android directory.

If you are using an older version of the cordova android platform you might need to run

cordova platform android update


To get moved to the gradle build system which is compatible with the current version of Android Studio
