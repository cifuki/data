Q:I have searched everywhere for a solution to my problem but cannot find a answer. Here's the problem. 

I have a layout that looks like this



Now when I click in the edit text(search bar) i want the following to happen



The soft keyboard basically needs to push up the whole screens content so that the search bar is at the top and its listview is beneath it so that when the content is searched the results are displayed. I have tried setting android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan" to the Activity in the manifest but this did not work. I set a scroll view as the main container in the main layout that contains the fragments but that also did not work. I have tried adding the edit text(search bar) as a header to the list view but this also did not work. Every time the keyboard pushed up the edit text but covered the list view. Is there any way to make this work?

A:Actually if you want your entire layout pan up than you should use :

SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN

meaning:

getActivity().getWindow().setSoftInputMode(
                WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN);


this will keep the keyboard closed and when opened it'll push your entire activity up.
