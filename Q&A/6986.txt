Q:I have Eclipse Juno SR1 and Android SDK Tools 21.1, SDK Platform-tools 16.0.2 (latest) on Mac.

When I have some XML file selected and hit Run button, nothing happens. I have to select some Java File or project in the Package Explorer. Then it runs. It's quite annoying when I edit XML files. It was working in previous releases of Android SDK Tools. 

Anyone knows any solution or workaround?

A:I think its due to some recent changes in ADT 21.1.0. Anyhow, to resolve this, you may configure the following in Eclipse:


  Window -> Preferences -> Run/Debug ->
  Launching -> (under Launch Operations) Always launch the
  previously launched application


In case you want to open another project, then you need to revert this process as it will always launch the previously launched application.

Also, keep in mind that this issue may be fixed in the future versions of ADT, so don't rely hard on this solution.
