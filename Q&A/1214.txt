Q:This morning I came up with a problem trying to handle the onConfigurationChanged event. The problem is that the method, which I override, is not getting called when I change the orientation of the phone. Not getting called at all. 

I've put android:configChanges="orientation" on the activity defined in the manifest as mentioned on the android documentation, but this don't make a difference.

Have you come up with this problem?

A:This was my gremlin for the ~same problem:


  Caution: Beginning with Android 3.2 (API level 13), the "screen size"
  also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape
  orientation. Thus, if you want to prevent runtime restarts due to
  orientation change when developing for API level 13 or higher (as
  declared by the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion attributes), you
  must include the "screenSize" value in addition to the "orientation"
  value. That is, you must decalare
  android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize". However, if your
  application targets API level 12 or lower, then your activity always
  handles this configuration change itself (this configuration change
  does not restart your activity, even when running on an Android 3.2 or
  higher device).


(From http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html)

TL;DR: add "|screenSize" to configChanges when targeting API level 13+
