Q:Is there any way to copy and paste from outside the VM into the Genymotion Emulator?

A:Copy/pasting text from the host into the virtual device is possible since version 2.1.0. (Note that simply updating Genymotion does not suffice, you also have to recreate the virtual device after updating to 2.1.0 or greater.)

Pasting can be performed via long tap/click + PASTE in the virtual device.
