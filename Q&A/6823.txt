Q:I've seen several examples that use
android:layout_height="0px" or "0dip" but i do not understand the impact of this. It seems that would make the layout 0 pixels tall. Is the value mitigated but some other factor like 'weight' or the height of any parent views?

A:Yep you are right about the weight, when you want the width or height to be controlled by weight its convention to set that value to 0dip and let the weight control the actual value. Although I am pretty sure 0 is just arbitrary here you could put anything but putting 0 makes your intention more clear.
