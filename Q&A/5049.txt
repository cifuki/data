Q:When I try to use ConstraintLayout in my layout content_main.xml, I get the following message:


  Using version 1.0.0-alpha5 of the constraint library, which is obsolete


I am currently using the following library dependency:

compile 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.0.0-alpha5'


How can I get the latest version number of constraint layout?

A:EDIT: Now that we are publishing ConstraintLayout directly on maven, you can check the maven directory:

https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/android/support/constraint/group-index.xml



Look in the SDK Manager in Android Studio. If you check the "Show Package Details" in the SDK Tools section, you should see all the available verions of ConstraintLayout (under Support Repository -> ConstraintLayout for Android)
