Q:I have an "open" animation and am using Handler.postDelayed(Runnable, delay) to trigger a "close" animation after a short delay. However, during the time between open and close, there is possibly another animation triggered by a click.

My question is, how would I cancel the "close" animation in the handler?

A:Just use the removeCallbacks(Runnable r) method.
