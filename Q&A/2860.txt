Q:I have the following code to take a video as a raw resource, start the video and loop it but I need the video to loop seamlessly as of now when it comes to an end of the clip and starts the clip again the transition between causes a flicker for a split second, which I really can't have for my app. 

public class Example extends Activity {
    VideoView vv;
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        vv = (VideoView)findViewById(R.id.VideoView01);

        //Video Loop
        vv.setOnCompletionListener(new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener() {
            public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {
                vv.start(); //need to make transition seamless.
            }
        });

        Uri uri = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.example/"
                + R.raw.video);

        vv.setVideoURI(uri);
        vv.requestFocus();    
        vv.start();
    }
}


The clip is only 22 seconds long but was created to be seamless so it is possible to work without the delay.

A:Try this it will work 100%



videoView.setOnPreparedListener(new OnPreparedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPrepared(MediaPlayer mp) {
        mp.setLooping(true);
    }
});
