Q:I have an Activity with some EditText fields and some buttons as a convenience for what normally would be used to populate those fields.  However when we the user touches one of the EditText fields the Android soft keyboard automatically appears.  I want it to remain hidden by default, unless the user long presses the menu button.  I have search for a solution to this and found several answers, but so far I can't get them to work.

I have tried the following:

1 - In the onCreate method,

this.getWindow().setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN);


2 - Also in the onCreate method,

InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager)getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(editText.getWindowToken(), InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY);


3 - and fIn the Manifest file,

<activity android:name=".activityName" android:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysHidden"/>


None of these methods work.  Whenever the user clicks on the EditText field, the soft keyboard appears.  I only want the soft keyboard to appear if the user explicitly shows it by long pressing the menu key.

Why isn't this working?

A:This will help you

editText.setInputType(InputType.TYPE_NULL);


Edit: 

To show soft keyboard, you have to write following code in long key press event of menu button

editText.setInputType(InputType.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT);
            editText.requestFocus();
            InputMethodManager mgr = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
            mgr.showSoftInput(editText, InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED);
