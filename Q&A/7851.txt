Q:I've experienced a LOT of strange behaviours with using WebView in Android and I'm wondering why there are so many diffrences between the WebView and the Browserinstalled on each phone?

As an example, I've developed some applications that had to display HTML content, which contained either jquery-mobile, flash,javascript, YouTube embedded and so on. So I had a lot of problems with displaying this pages inside WebViews. Either they wouldn't get displayed at all, just blank, either the videos won't play and so on. And the strange thing is that they work properly if opened in the Browser installed on the phone. I had JavaScript enabled, I tried diffrent WebSettings, I had set the WebChromeClient and WebViewClient looking for javascript errors... but nothing worked.

So I got to the conclusion that the WebView component is completely different from the Browser application installed on the phones. I'm thinking that every manufacturer makes their own Browser to support as many as possible pages, and the WebView remains the standard one, included in the Android SDK.

Am I right? Or there is another reasons/explanation for this?
Thanks.

EDIT: Everything that @ondoteam has suggested was enabled and set at the time being. I no longer have the references to that websites, which anyway were internal.

A:This article outlines your speculation about stock browser differences between manufacturers, that absolutely is true: 5 reality checks every team needs before working on Android webkit

...which does cause trouble and mysterious/difficult to diagnose/solve problems.

As far as your issues with your WebView implementation:

Version of jquery-mobile may be an issue jquery-mobile loaded into an android WebView if you are using jquery.mobile-1.0.1.min.js you may want to try the uncompressed  jquery.mobile-1.0.1.js 

And Flash :-/ Good luck:
Screen blinking when using a webview with flash

Flash in WebView not working on Android 3.2

Flash video not displaying in WebView for Android 3.0.1

For loading SWF:

Load an SWF into a WebView

loading flash files (.swf) webview in android

Good luck with that, seems like a lot of variables with devices, Android versions, etc. And will take persistence with trial/error.
