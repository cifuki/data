Q:I am just learning Rx-java and Rxandroid2 and I am just confused what is the major difference between in SubscribeOn and ObserveOn.

A:SubscribeOn specify the Scheduler on which an Observable will operate.
ObserveOn specify the Scheduler on which an observer will observe this Observable.

So basically SubscribeOn is mostly subscribed (executed) on a background thread ( you do not want to block the UI thread while waiting for the observable) and also in ObserveOn you want to observe the result on a main thread...

If you are familiar with AsyncTask then SubscribeOn is similar to doInBackground method and ObserveOn to onPostExecute...
