Q:I am trying to get an address based on the long/lat. it appears that something like this should work? 

Geocoder myLocation = Geocoder(Locale.getDefault());
    List myList = myLocation.getFromLocation(latPoint,lngPoint,1);


The issue is that I keep getting : The method Geocoder(Locale) is undefined for the type savemaplocation

Any assistance would be helpful. Thank you.



Thanks, I tried the context, locale one first, and that failed and was looking at some of the other constructors (I had seen one that had mentioned just locale). Regardless,

It did not work, as I am still getting : The method Geocoder(Context, Locale) is undefined for the type savemaplocation

I do have : import android.location.Geocoder;

A:The following code snippet is doing it for me (lat and lng are doubles declared above this bit):

Geocoder geocoder = new Geocoder(this, Locale.getDefault());
List<Address> addresses = geocoder.getFromLocation(lat, lng, 1);
