Q:Does someone know how do I get the path of my application directory? (e.g. /data/data/my.app.lication/)

Currently I'm using this method: myActivity.getFilesDir().getParent(); but it seems to me like a workaround when there's a simpler solution. Also, the side-effect is the creation of the files directory, which is un-needed.

Clarification: First - Thanks for the repliers. I try to understand if there's already exists method that does it, not for another work-around.

A:PackageManager m = getPackageManager();
String s = getPackageName();
PackageInfo p = m.getPackageInfo(s, 0);
s = p.applicationInfo.dataDir;


If eclipse worries about an uncaught NameNotFoundException, you can use:

PackageManager m = getPackageManager();
String s = getPackageName();
try {
    PackageInfo p = m.getPackageInfo(s, 0);
    s = p.applicationInfo.dataDir;
} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
    Log.w("yourtag", "Error Package name not found ", e);
}
