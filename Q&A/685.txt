Q:I'm installing the Android SDK on a fresh installation of Fedora 14 (Linux). I installed eclipse, and ran the tools/android sdk tool to install all the Eclipse components for the SDK. I was able to get DDMS to install when selecting it by itself.

And for the last component - the Android developer tools, I'm getting the ugly error message pasted below. 

Now I'm Stuck in Eclipse dependency hell. 

I've searched through the available packages in Fedora and I can't find the one that has the files necessary to satisfy this Eclipse dependency. Can anybody please translate what it is that Eclipse is asking for and what Fedora package it lives in?

The ugly error:

Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
  Software being installed: Android Development Tools 0.9.9.v201009221407-60953 (com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.feature.group 0.9.9.v201009221407-60953)
  Missing requirement: Android Development Tools 0.9.9.v201009221407-60953 (com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.feature.group 0.9.9.v201009221407-60953) requires 'org.eclipse.wst.sse.core 0.0.0' but it could not be found

A:I've just encountered exactly the same problem in Eclipse 3.6 (Helios). After plenty of Googling I came across this link:

http://code.google.com/intl/es/eclipse/docs/faq.html#wstinstallerror


  During installation, there's an error
  about requiring
  org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui. How do I fix
  that?
  
  The Google Plugin for Eclipse depends
  on other specific Eclipse components,
  such as WST. Your installation of
  Eclipse may not yet include all of
  them, but they can be easily installed
  by following these instructions.
  Eclipse 3.6 (Helios)
  
  
  Select Help > Install New Software...
  Click the link for Available Software Sites.
  Ensure there is an update site named Helios. If this is not present,
  click Add... and enter
  http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios
  for the Location.
  Now go through the installation steps; Eclipse should download and
  install the plugin's dependencies.
  


(There are examples in that page for 3.5 (Galileo), 3.4 (Ganymede) & 3.3 (Europa) for anyone with different versions)

The exact same steps work for 3.7 (Indigo) as well.

Just use http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo for the location.

Juno: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno

Kepler: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler

Note: Step four is not necessary. Only steps one to three are necessary.
