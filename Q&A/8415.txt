Q:I am trying to achieve something similar to Google Play Music's "Listen Now" layout. Every example I have found on the web is a single, simple RecyclerView. I am trying to achieve something much more complex. Something like 



Can the whole layout (minus the toolbar) be a single RecyclerView, that contains two more RecyclerViews? Something like

Ultimately, what I want to achieve is a layout like the below, and stay performant.

<RecyclerView> //vertical
    <RecyclerView/> //vertical
    <RecyclerView/> //horizontal
    <LinearLayout/> //horizontal
</RecyclerView>

A:You can't take recyclerview inside recyclerview tag.
Rather in your first adapter's bindViewHolder call again recyclerview adapter like:-

InnerRecyclerviewAdapter adapter=new InnerRecyclerviewAdapter(context,urlistArray);
holder.recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
holder.recyclerView.setHasFixedSize(true);
LinearLayoutManager layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(context, LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, false);
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);


wrap_content will also work with latest recyclerview
