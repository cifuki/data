Q:I find myself curious why the setLargeIcon method on Notification.Builder only accepts a Bitmap, with no overload to provide a resource id. Perhaps it was done for performance reasons, but it seems odd as setSmallIcon does accept a res drawable id.

Notification.Builder builder = new Notification.Builder(application);
// ....
builder.setLargeIcon(iconBitmap);  // Requires a Bitmap
builder.setSmallIcon(iconResId);   // Requires a drawable resource ID
Notification notification = builder.getNotification();


Sadly the bitmap provided is not scaled in the notification, so the Bitmap needs to be provided exactly the right size for the notification view.

Assuming I need to provide xhdpi, hdpi, mdpi and ldpi versions of the largeIcon bitmap, what sizes do they need to be? I can see no mention in the docs, or after scouring the wider web.

A:Not had a chance to check it yet but API 11 introduced the following public dimens:


notification_large_icon_height
notification_large_icon_width


Should be able to use those to scale your image before setting it on the notification.
