Q:In my android Studio, Compiler is not able to locate ActionBarActivity. Because of it, I am getting many errors. The compiler is not able to import the ActionBarActivity and ActionBar class. 
These are the lines where compiler is throwing error:

import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity;
import android.support.v7.app.ActionBar;


I tried to search on stackoverflow before asking a question. The answer i got is for the eclipse which is to add the library. I tried doing it in Android Studio, but didn't get anything.

A:Follow the steps mentioned for using support ActionBar in Android Studio(0.4.2) :

Download the Android Support Repository from Android SDK Manager, SDK Manager icon will be available on Android Studio tool bar (or Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager).



After download you will find your Support repository here

$SDK_DIR\\extras\\android\\m2repository\\com\\android\\support\\appcompat-v7


Open your main module's build.gradle file and add following dependency for using action bar in lower API level

dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+'
}


Sync your project with gradle using the tiny Gradle icon available in toolbar  (or Tools -> Android -> Sync Project With Gradle Files).

There is some issue going on with Android Studio 0.4.2 so check this as well if you face any issue while importing classes in code.

Import Google Play Services library in Android Studio

If Required follow the steps as well :


Exit Android Studio
Delete all the .iml files and files inside .idea folder from your
project
Relaunch Android Studio and wait till the project synced completely
with gradle. If it shows an error in Event Log with import option click on Import Project.


This is bug in Android Studio 0.4.2 and fixed for Android Studio 0.4.3 release.
