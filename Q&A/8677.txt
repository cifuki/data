Q:I am working through debugging some touch handling stuff on Android, and am trying to figure out why the MotionEvent sent to my View's onTouchListener contains a cancel action. I have not been able to find any documentation on its cause, and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction for debugging this problem - error codes, source code, or some general knowledge.

A:Is this what you are looking for:

"ACTION_CANCEL occurs when the parent takes possession of the motion, 
for example when the user has dragged enough across a list view that it will 
start scrolling instead of letting you press the buttons inside of it. 
You can find out more about it at the viewgroup documentation: onInterceptTouchEvent."

Hope that is the answer you are looking for:
