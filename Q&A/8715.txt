Q:I need to get the dimensions of the display rectangle that the application can use on the device. For that I tried using:

Display display = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay();
int width = display.getWidth();
int height = display.getHeight();


My problem is that it gives me the height of the whole display and the display has a "status / notification" bar on top that the application can't use.

I need the acual dimension that the application can use.

To help you understand the question better I'll leave an image:

A:The biggest trick to all of this is that you can't usually gain access to a true value of that view's size until layout is complete.  Which means onCreate() (and often onResume() also) are too early in the process to do the calculation.  The following code will get you a view representing the content view of the Activity, at which point you can examine its height and width:

View content = getWindow().findViewById(Window.ID_ANDROID_CONTENT);
Log.d("DISPLAY", content.getWidth() + " x " + content.getHeight());


This also accounts for any title views you may have set in the Activity.  You could also obtain a reference to the root layout you set as the content view when the XML is inflated and do the same thing if that layout is set to fill_parent in both dimensions.

A good method where I often make calls like this is onWindowFocusChanged() which will be called at the point when your Activity is just about visible to the user.

Hope that Helps!
