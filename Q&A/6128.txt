Q:I need to display an image button that fades in and out (and in and out and so on...)
The transparency can be set with setAlpha but how can I fade in and out? I mean I cannot do it on another thread because you need to do such things on the UI thread, right?

I guess it can be done with animations but I haven't found anything, because I don't have any experience with animations and don't really know what to search for...

Actually what I really want is to fade one image in and another one out but I guess the easiest way is to place the first image button below the second and just fade the second one. Or is there an easier way to do it?

A:Here is the solution I'm using now, that works on API level lower than 12:

AlphaAnimation anim = new AlphaAnimation(1.0f, 0.0f);
anim.setDuration(1000);
anim.setRepeatCount(NUM_REPEATS);
anim.setRepeatMode(Animation.REVERSE);
button.startAnimation(anim);
