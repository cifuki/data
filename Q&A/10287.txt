Q:I am new to Android. Now, I am trying to work with database. I got many tutorials for manipulating Sqlite database operations. But my doubt is that where should I add the .db file in to the application. In package explorer window of IDE, under which folder group I need to add the .db file? I hope you understand my question.   

Thanks in advance.

A:If you already have .db file then put that file in assets folder or raw folder

Then you have to copy that file at path /your.package.name/data/data directory
for further use.

Otherwise you can create new database using code...
Hope this will help you ...! 

see this example....
