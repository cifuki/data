Q:After update to v23.2.0 in my RecyclerView I have items with huge empty vertical space, between the items. 

My item layout is very simple:

 <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent"                                    
       android:orientation="vertical" >

A:According to the doc


  With the release 23.2.0 there is an exciting new feature to the LayoutManager API: auto-measurement!
  This allows a RecyclerView to size itself based on the size of its contents. This means that previously unavailable scenarios, such as using WRAP_CONTENT for a dimension of the RecyclerView, are now possible.
  You\xe2\x80\x99ll find all built in LayoutManagers now support auto-measurement.


Due to this change, make sure to double check the layout parameters of your item views: previously ignored layout parameters (such as MATCH_PARENT in the scroll direction) will now be fully respected.

In your item layout you have to change: 

android:layout_height="match_parent"


with

android:layout_height="wrap_content"
