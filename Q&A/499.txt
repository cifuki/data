Q:When an EditText is in password mode, it seems that the hint is shown in a different font (courrier?). How can I avoid this? I would like the hint to appear in the same font that when the EditText is not in password mode.

My current xml:

<EditText 
android:hint="@string/edt_password_hint"
android:layout_width="fill_parent"
android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
android:password="true"
android:singleLine="true" />

A:Changing the typeface in xml didn't work on the hint text for me either.  I found two different solutions, the second of which has better behavior for me:

1) Remove android:inputType="textPassword" from your xml file and instead, in set it in java:

EditText password = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.password_text);
password.setTransformationMethod(new PasswordTransformationMethod());


With this approach, the hint font looks good but as you're typing in that edit field, you don't see each character in plain text before it turns into a password dot. Also when making input in fullscreen, the dots will not appear, but the password in clear text.

2) Leave android:inputType="textPassword" in your xml.  In Java, ALSO set the typeface and passwordMethod:

EditText password = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.register_password_text);
password.setTypeface(Typeface.DEFAULT);
password.setTransformationMethod(new PasswordTransformationMethod());


This approach gave me the hint font I wanted AND gives me the behavior I want with the password dots.

Hope that helps!
