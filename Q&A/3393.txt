A:You can save old color and then use it to restore the original value. Here is an example:

ColorStateList oldColors =  textView.getTextColors(); //save original colors
textView.setTextColor(Color.RED);
....
textView.setTextColor(oldColors);//restore original colors




But in general default TextView text color is determined from current Theme applied to your Activity.
