Q:I have an AsyncTask that shows a progressDialog whilst working (it calls runOnUiThread from within doInBackground to show the progress dialog).

Whilst its running I want to allow the use of the back button to cancel the operation; someone else has had this problem: BACK Button is not working ,while progressDialog is running

For what ever reason I can't reply to that thread, hence having to start another?! (Another question for another day)

I had the same idea as Sandy but this code is never called whilst the progressDialog is showing, why is this? I have implemented it inside my main activity class, does the progressDialog take the foreground focus away from my class temporarily?

A:First, you should show your dialog from OnPreExecute, hide it in OnPostExecute, and - if necessary - modify it by publishing progress. (see here)

Now to your question: ProgressDialog.show() can take a OnCancelListener as an argument. You should provide one that calls cancel() on the progress dialog instance.

example:

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute(){
        _progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(
                YourActivity.this,
                "Title",
                "Message",
                true,
                true,
                new DialogInterface.OnCancelListener(){
                    @Override
                    public void onCancel(DialogInterface dialog) {
                        YourTask.this.cancel(true);
                        finish();
                    }
                }
        );
    }


where _progressDialog is a ProgressDialog member of YourTask.


  This class was deprecated in API level 26. ProgressDialog is a modal
  dialog, which prevents the user from interacting with the app. Instead
  of using this class, you should use a progress indicator like
  ProgressBar, which can be embedded in your app's UI. Alternatively,
  you can use a notification to inform the user of the task's progress. LINK
