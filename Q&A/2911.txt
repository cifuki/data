Q:I am trying to read SharedPreferences inside Fragment. My code is what I use to get preferences in any other Activity.

     SharedPreferences preferences = getSharedPreferences("pref", 0);


I get error 

    Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method getSharedPreferences(String, int) from the type ContextWrapper    


I have tried to follow these links but with no luck Accessing SharedPreferences through static methods and 
Static SharedPreferences. Thank you for any solution.

A:The method getSharedPreferences is  a method of the Context object, so just calling getSharedPreferences from a Fragment will not work...because it is not a Context! (Activity is an extension of Context, so we can call getSharedPreferences from it).

So you have to get your applications Context by

// this = your fragment
SharedPreferences preferences = this.getActivity().getSharedPreferences("pref", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
