Q:Jon Willis has posted on how to enable an infinite scrolling with his code.
In there he said that he made some changes in the ViewPager class int the android support library. Which changes have been made and how is it possible to "recompile" the library with the ViewPager change?

A:I solved this problem very simply using a little hack in the adapter. Here is my code:

public class MyPagerAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter
{
    public static int LOOPS_COUNT = 1000;
    private ArrayList<Product> mProducts;


    public MyPagerAdapter(FragmentManager manager, ArrayList<Product> products)
    {
        super(manager);
        mProducts = products;
    }


    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int position)
    {
        if (mProducts != null && mProducts.size() > 0)
        {
            position = position % mProducts.size(); // use modulo for infinite cycling
            return MyFragment.newInstance(mProducts.get(position));
        }
        else
        {
            return MyFragment.newInstance(null);
        }
    }


    @Override
    public int getCount()
    {
        if (mProducts != null && mProducts.size() > 0)
        {
            return mProducts.size()*LOOPS_COUNT; // simulate infinite by big number of products
        }
        else
        {
            return 1;
        }
    }
} 


And then, in the ViewPager, we set current page to the middle:

mAdapter = new MyPagerAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager(), mProducts);
mViewPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);
mViewPager.setCurrentItem(mViewPager.getChildCount() * MyPagerAdapter.LOOPS_COUNT / 2, false); // set current item in the adapter to middle
