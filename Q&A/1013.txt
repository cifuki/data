Q:Can this attribute be changed dynamically in Java code? 

android:layout_marginRight


I have a TextView, that has to change its position some pixels to the left dynamically.

How to do it programmatically?

A:EDIT: A more generic way of doing this that doesn't rely on the layout type (other than that it is a layout type which supports margins):

public static void setMargins (View v, int l, int t, int r, int b) {
    if (v.getLayoutParams() instanceof ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams) {
        ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams p = (ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams) v.getLayoutParams();
        p.setMargins(l, t, r, b);
        v.requestLayout();
    }
}


You should check the docs for TextView. Basically, you'll want to get the TextView's LayoutParams object, and modify the margins, then set it back to the TextView. Assuming it's in a LinearLayout, try something like this:

TextView tv = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.my_text_view);
LinearLayout.LayoutParams params = (LinearLayout.LayoutParams)tv.getLayoutParams();
params.setMargins(0, 0, 10, 0); //substitute parameters for left, top, right, bottom
tv.setLayoutParams(params);


I can't test it right now, so my casting may be off by a bit, but the LayoutParams are what need to be modified to change the margin.

NOTE


  Don't forget that if your TextView is inside, for example, a
  RelativeLayout, one should use RelativeLayout.LayoutParams instead of
  LinearLayout.LayoutParams
