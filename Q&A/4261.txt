Q:so, i'm trying to push some files to /system on android device (zte)
I've rooted, connected with ADB, 

adb remount -> I get permission denied
adb shell su -> I'm able to access shell and create folders etc and edit filesystem

(but in shell I can't copy a file from my computer to device)

Any help please

A:In case anyone has the same problem in the future:

$ adb shell
$ su
# mount -o rw,remount /system


Both adb remount and adb root don't work on a production build without altering ro.secure, but you can still remount /system by opening a shell, asking for root permissions and typing the mount command.
