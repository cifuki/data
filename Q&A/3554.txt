A:I just found out about App Dev Wiki.  As described on its website:


  This wiki is meant to collect links, tools, libraries, and anything
  that is useful for mobile development.


Currently listed android frameworks are:


ignition
droid-fu
RoboGuice
Commonsware
ActionBarSherlock
Spring Android
DroidParts
