Q:Google release the new Gmail app with an alternate way to handle pull down to refresh.

Instead of showing the started hidden row that is pulled down. Gmail displays an animated message overtop of the action bar.

The message includes an animated horizontal line.

Is this a standard feature of the Android SDK? I can't find anything in the action bar API that would do this.

A:Chris Banes' ActionBar-PullToRefresh library on GitHub probably offers pull-to-refresh functionality closest to GMail app.
