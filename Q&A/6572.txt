Q:In expandable Notifications: what dimensions (in dp) should the icons have?
Like the Icons for Snooze and Email here:

A:So to clarify this, I found the following in the Javadoc within the Android support library:


  Add an action to this notification. Actions are typically displayed by
  the system as a button adjacent to the notification content.   
  
  Every action must have an icon (32dp square and matching the Holo Dark
  action bar visual
  style,
  a textual label, and a
  PendingIntent.
  
  A notification in its expanded form can display up to 3 actions, from
  left to right in the order they were added. Actions will not be
  displayed when the notification is collapsed, however, so be sure that
  any essential functions may be accessed by the user in some other way.


So these should be identical to your action bar icons (for the Holo Dark theme), which is:

Asset Size: 32dp x 32dp
Optical Square: 24dp x 24dp
Color (Enabled): #FFFFFF 80% opacity
Color (Disabled): #FFFFFF 30% opacity
