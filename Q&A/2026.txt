Q:If you use the Vector Asset wizard in Android Studio 1.5.0, any vector drawable XML you import using that wizard goes into res/drawable/.

However, the build/ directory, and the resulting APK show that those XML files get moved into a res/drawable-anydpi-v21/ resource directory. The -v21 part makes sense, as VectorDrawable is only supported on API Level 21+. However, -anydpi seems to be undocumented. I would have expected -nodpi, both for the original import destination and for where the build system elects to move it.

Has anyone seen official statements for what -anydpi means, and what its relationship is with -nodpi? I am looking for practical effects, not merely what some code comments hint at.

A:nodpi


  These are density-independent resources. The system does not scale resources tagged with this qualifier, regardless of the current screen's density.


For instance:


drawable-nodpi/dot.png


The dot will appear small on xxhdpi, big on ldpi.

However, the resource resolver will match a specific qualifier if it exists.

For instance


drawable-hdpi/eg.png
drawable-nodpi-v21/eg.xml


On a Lollipop (API 21) hdpi device, the bitmap is used.

On a Lollipop (API 21) xhdpi device, the vector is used.

anydpi


  These resources take precedence in any dpi.


For instance


drawable-hdpi/eg.png
drawable-anydpi-v21/eg.xml


On a Lollipop (API 21) hdpi device, the vector is used.

On a Lollipop (API 21) xhdpi device, the vector is used.
