Q:Every time I use Search In Path in Android Studio, I end up with generated code being returned as the first section of results. 

I usually search for something in *.java,*.xml, and usually investigate the first few results before I realize I'm looking at Generated Code. Is there a way to omit the generated code results from being returned as part of the result list, while still allowing the search to read all of the *.java and *.xml files in my project? 

I have a feeling this is something beyond ridiculously simple, but I just can't find the right button to toggle. 



In the same vein, is it possible to ignore generated classes when loading files or types? I keep getting the generated MyClass$$ViewInjector classes appearing first in open files, and it's just annoying...

A:The way I've been doing to ignore generated classes in advanced search is adding !file:*intermediates*/&&!file:*generated*/&&!lib:*..* to a new Custom Scope, like this:



14-October-2015 Update: I have improved the pattern by also excluding the !lib:*..* from the search. Thanks.
