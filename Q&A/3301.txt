Q:I'm using the chrome mobile browser on galaxy s4, android 4.2.2 and for some reason every time I scroll the page down, it fires a resize event verified by the scaling of images from a jquery.cycle2 slideshow.

Any idea why this might be happening?

A:Just for curiosity I was trying to reproduce it and if I'm correct this is caused by the navigation chrome bar.

When you scroll down and chrome hides the browser navigation bar it produces a window resize, but this is correct, because after that we have a bigger window size due to the free space that the browser nav bar has leave.
