Q:I am looking for a way to disable my map fragment's auto centre on selected marker functionality. I still want the markers InfoWindow to show up, but just not centre the entire map on the marker I have selected.

A:Take a look at the following post:

Don't snap to marker after click in android map v2

There is a method given there by @DMan, basically you need to consume the OnMarkerClick event and override the default behavior:

// Since we are consuming the event this is necessary to
// manage closing openned markers before openning new ones
Marker lastOpenned = null;

mMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(new OnMarkerClickListener() {
public boolean onMarkerClick(Marker marker) {
    // Check if there is an open info window
    if (lastOpenned != null) {
        // Close the info window
        lastOpenned.hideInfoWindow();

        // Is the marker the same marker that was already open
        if (lastOpenned.equals(marker)) {
            // Nullify the lastOpenned object
            lastOpenned = null;
            // Return so that the info window isn't openned again
            return true;
        } 
    }

    // Open the info window for the marker
    marker.showInfoWindow();
    // Re-assign the last openned such that we can close it later
    lastOpenned = marker;

    // Event was handled by our code do not launch default behaviour.
    return true;
}
});
