Q:Hi as per android documentation the drawable folder needs to have multiple sub-directories for images of different dpis. However in Android Studio creating any sub directory in the drawable folder causes it to fail to detect any images at all. On the other hand if an image is placed directly in the drawable folder it gets detected and becomes available for use view R.drawable.ImageName. In this case how do we use different dpi images for the same ImageName?

A:The standard procedures are:


Choose Project > app > scr > main
Right click "res", choose "New" and choose "Android resource directory"

In the opened dialog, at Resource Type choose "drawable"

In the list Available qualifier choose Density, then click the right arrow at the middle.

Choose the Density that you like then press OK
