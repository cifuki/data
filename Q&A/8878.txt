Q:In Apress Pro Android 4 the author has said that: 


  [...] context of currently running activity will no longer be valid when the device is rotated. [...] One approach is to use a weak reference to the activity instead of a hard reference [...]


But the author just suggest this, and does not tell how it is done. Who has done this before please give me an example.

A:Somewhere in your AsyncTask you'll want to pass in your activity. Then you'll save that reference in a weak reference. Then you can dereference and use it again in onPostExecute.

Class member:

WeakReference<Activity> weakActivity;


Somewhere in AsyncTask, probably either constructor or onPreExecute:

weakActivity = new WeakReference<Activity>(activity);


In onPostExecute:

Activity activity = weakActivity.get();
if (activity != null) {
   // do your stuff with activity here
}
