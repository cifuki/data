Q:In my buildType I see this:

buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
}


I have some questions:


Why there are two files? 
What is the difference between them?
Where should I write my rules?

A:The getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt') method obtains
  the default ProGuard settings from the Android SDK tools/proguard/
  folder. The proguard-android-optimize.txt file is also available in
  this Android SDK folder with the same rules but with optimizations
  enabled. ProGuard optimizations perform analysis at the bytecode
  level, inside and across methods to help make your app smaller and run
  faster. Android Studio adds the proguard-rules.pro file at the root
  of the module, so you can also easily add custom ProGuard rules
  specific to the current module.


Please refer this: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code

Meaning that you should add your custom proguard file into proguard-rules.pro,if you want to separate some rules to many files,you can do it and declare them after this:

proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
