Q:When I installed the latest installment in Mac OSX  - the Mountain Lion - I experienced some problems getting Eclipse to work I also lost most of my Android developer files (but I still have my projects). I suspect this is due to the choice of removing the /Developer and move the XCode and other Apple developer tools (I placed my Android tools here). 

I have now installed the latest version of Eclipse and the problem still seems to be around. There are errors in all my projects and I get an error message prompting: 

The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced 
from required .class files


I tried to check the Java class-path both in Eclipse and in my terminal and these seems to be OK. java and javac both run in my terminal and there is a valid path to the java source files in Eclipse (Under Preferences, Java, Installed JREs). That being said I'm not an expert in Eclipse so there may be that I have misunderstood how this problem ought to be solved. Anyone here with similar problems or who know the cure?

A:Make sure that you have a valid JRE or JDK defined in the Java Build Path of your project. Right-click on your project, select Properties... and then Java Build Path.
