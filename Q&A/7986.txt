Q:When you insert a new item into a database like this 

Uri uri = getContentResolver().insert(Tournaments.CONTENT_URI, values); 


is there any way to get the id from the uri that is returned so I don't have to run a query to get the id since its already in the returned uri?

A:ContentUris.parseId() converts the last path segment to a long.
