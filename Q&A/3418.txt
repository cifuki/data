Q:I'm trying to run helloandroid application on a Motorola Milestone A853. I typed "adb devices" and the mobile is properly recognized. However, when I try to run the application Eclipse always stuck at 27% "Launching delegate".

Which could be the reason?

A:Had the same 27% problem with an emulator.  It only got fixed after I deleted the AVD and recreated it, so this is very likely device/emulator related (and furthermore restarting the ADB did not fix the problem).

EDIT:

Found this over at project pages as Issue #21073, answered by benpar:

Update: This scenario can also be avoided if the AVD emulator is launched from the AVD Manager within Eclipse. The issue happens when launching the first emulator from the Run button in Eclipse.

To avoid:


Start Eclipse
Window -> AVD Manager
Start an emulator
Run the project
