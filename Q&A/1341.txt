Q:I have gone through many questions like this on Google Play, I am using Android 4.2.2 API 17. 

My app requires Google play services 8.1 , It compiles fine and when it runs on emulator it shows message that 'You need to update your Google play services ' , 

When I click on update nothing happens, 

How can I update the Google Play services  without downloading any latest API version ?

You can update Google Play Services via the Play Store app in your emulator just as you would on a physical Android device from API 24.

  Google Play Support - From Google : We know that many app developers use Google Play
  Services, and it can be difficult to keep the service up to date in
  the Android Emulator system images. To solve this problem, we now
  offer versions of Android System Images that include the Play Store
  app. The Google Play images are available starting with Android Nougat
  (API 24). With these new emulator images, you can update Google Play
  Services via the Play Store app in your emulator just as you would on
  a physical Android device. Plus, you can now test end-to-end install,
  update, and purchase flows with the Google Play Store.
