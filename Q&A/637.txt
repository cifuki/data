Q:Is it possible to make the ListView horizontally? I have done this Using gallery view, but the selected item comes to the center of the screen automatically. I don't want the selected item at the same spot I clicked. How can I Rectify this Problem? My Idea was to set the ListView with horizontal scroll. Share your idea?

A:As per Android Documentation RecyclerView is the new way to organize the items in listview and to be displayed horizontally

automatically implemented
Animation is easy to perform
Many more features

Just add the below block to make the ListView to horizontal from vertical

Code-snippet

LinearLayoutManager layoutManager= new LinearLayoutManager(this,LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, false);
mRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recycler_view);
mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);
