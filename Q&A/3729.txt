Q:I have strings with some numbers and english words and I need to translate them to my mother tongue by finding them and replacing them by locallized version of this word. Do you know how to easily achieve replacing words in a string?

Thanks

Edit:

I have tried (part of a string "to" should be replaced by "xyz"):

string.replace("to", "xyz")


But it is not working...

A:It is working, but it wont modify the caller object, but returning a new String. 
So you just need to assign it to a new String variable, or to itself:

string = string.replace("to", "xyz");


or

String newString = string.replace("to", "xyz");


API Docs
