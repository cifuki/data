Q:I'm developing an application which sends a message to a specific number in a specific period of time. The problem is that it continues sending that message after that period of time. How would I stop the timer after that specific time in order to stop sending that message?

A:CountDownTimer waitTimer;
     waitTimer = new CountDownTimer(60000, 300) {

       public void onTick(long millisUntilFinished) {
          //called every 300 milliseconds, which could be used to
          //send messages or some other action
       }

       public void onFinish() {
          //After 60000 milliseconds (60 sec) finish current 
          //if you would like to execute something when time finishes          
       }
     }.start();


to stop the timer early:

     if(waitTimer != null) {
         waitTimer.cancel();
         waitTimer = null;
     }
