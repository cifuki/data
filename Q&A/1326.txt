Q:I have an Activity with an EditText, a button and a ListView.  The purpose is to type a search screen in the EditText, press the button and have the search results populate this list.

This is all working perfectly, but the virtual keyboard is behaving strange.

If I click the EditText, I get the virtual keyboard.  If I click the "Done" button on the virtual keyboard, it goes away.  However, if I click my search button before clicking "Done" on the virtual keyboard, the virtual keyboard stays and I can't get rid of it.  Clicking the "Done" button does not close the keyboard.  It changes the "Done" button from "Done" to an arrow and remains visible.

Thanks for your help

A:InputMethodManager inputManager = (InputMethodManager)
                                  getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE); 

inputManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(getCurrentFocus().getWindowToken(),
                                     InputMethodManager.HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS);


I put this right after the onClick(View v) event.  

You need to import android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager;

The keyboard hides when you click the button.
