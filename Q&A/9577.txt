Q:I'v just installed Android Studio 0.8.2 for my first time and I have a lot of "Cannot resolve symbol" errors.
The errors occur on both new projects and projects which were exported from eclipse.

JDK version: jdk1.8.0_11

Android studio errors:

A:In the menu bar

Select tools>-android>-SDK manager

and download the SDK build tools, SDK platform and Google API's( the Google API stores packages such as "import android.view.Menu" etc.) for the target SDK version of your project(20 as shown in your screenshot).
if you are not sure which items you have to download , you can select all of them.(will take more time to download of course). 

Restart the IDE
