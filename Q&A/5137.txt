Q:I know that this is possible in eclipse by following the advice here: Android: resource String automatic generation

But I can't seem to find if this is possible in android studio yet. Anybody know how to do this?

Basically I would like to take a hardcoded string and auto create a @string reference in my main values.xml or strings.xml.

A:Alt+Enter, Extract String Resource while the caret is inside the hardcoded string:



The same should work in XML files as well, and it does work in IntelliJ IDEA, but seems to be broken in the current version of the Android Studio:



Android Studio 0.1.3 shows the folded text in XML layouts that it extracts from the string resources, but it fails to navigate back to the resource and doesn't offer to extract resources from the hardcoded strings inside XML. It appears to be a bug.
