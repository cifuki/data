Q:I'm developing a JavaScript application that needs to run on the Google Android Phone OS.  Is there a way to enable the JavaScript Error/Debug console within Safari on either the Android Emulator or an actual device?  If so any instructions on how to do so would be appreciated.

A:A quick Google turns up this blog post (posted after you asked your question), that should at least let you see any Javascript errors via the Android Debug Bridge using the command:

adb logcat WebCore:V *:S


Not quite the same as a full debug console though.
