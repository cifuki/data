Q:I'm developing android with SDK 2.3.3 using Eclipse IDE.
As you all know to run my app, I should generate virtual device.
From 'create new AVD' window, I can see many targets. 
There are 2 targets for API level 10 such as 'android 2.3.3' and Google APIs(Google Inc).
Among those targets, I'm uncertain which one I should choose.

My question is what's the difference between them.

Thanks in advance
Dan

A:The Google API includes Google Maps and other Google-specific libraries.  The Android one only includes core Android libraries.

As for which one to choose, I would go with the Android API until you find that you need the Google API; such as when you need Google Maps functionality.

Here is a link to the Google API page.
