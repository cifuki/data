Q:I have some views that I make visible upon a button press. I want them to disappear if I click outside of those views.

How would this be done on Android? 

Also, I realize that the "back button" can also assist Android users with this - I might use that as a secondary way to close the views - but some of the tablets aren't even using a 'physical' back button anymore, it has been very de-emphasized.

A:An easy/stupid way:


Create a dummy empty view (let's say ImageView with no source), make it fill parent
If it is clicked, then do what you want to do.


You need to have the root tag in your XML file to be a RelativeLayout. It will contain two element: your dummy view (set its position to align the Parent Top). The other one is your original view containing the views and the button (this view might be a LinearLayout or whatever you make it. don't forget to set its position to align the Parent Top)

Hope this will help you, Good Luck !
