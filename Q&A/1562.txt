Q:I can't find relevant methods in the Retrofit API for logging complete request/response bodies. I
was expecting some help in the Profiler (but it only offers meta-data about response). I tried setting the log level in the Builder, but this doesn't help me either :

RestAdapter adapter = (new RestAdapter.Builder()).
                setEndpoint(baseUrl).
                setRequestInterceptor(interceptor).
                setProfiler(profiler).
                setClient(client).
                setExecutors(MyApplication.getWebServiceThreadPool()).
                setLogLevel(LogLevel.FULL).
                setLog(new RestAdapter.Log() {
                    @Override
                    public void log(String msg) {
                        Log.i(TAG, msg);
                    }
                }).
                build();


EDIT: This code is working now. I don't know why it wasn't working earlier. Possibly because I was using some older version of retrofit.

A:I used setLogLevel(LogLevel.FULL).setLog(new AndroidLog("YOUR_LOG_TAG")), it helped me.
UPDATE. You can also try for debug purpose use retrofit.client.Response as response model
