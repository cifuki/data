Q:I know we have back button in android to move us back on the previous form, but my team leader asked to put a back button functionality on button click

How can I do this?

A:You should use finish() when the user clicks on the button in order to go to the previous activity.

Button backButton = (Button)this.findViewById(R.id.back);
backButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
  @Override
  public void onClick(View v) {
    finish();
  }
});


Alternatively, if you really need to, you can try to trigger your own back key press:

this.dispatchKeyEvent(new KeyEvent(KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN, KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK));
this.dispatchKeyEvent(new KeyEvent(KeyEvent.ACTION_UP, KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK));


Execute both of these.
