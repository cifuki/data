Q:I need to trigger a block of code after 20 minutes from the AlarmManager being set.

Can someone show me sample code on how to use an AlarmManager in \xd9\x90Android?

I have been playing around with some code for a few days and it just won't work.

A:"Some sample code" is not that easy when it comes to AlarmManager.

Here is a snippet showing the setup of AlarmManager:

AlarmManager mgr=(AlarmManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
Intent i=new Intent(context, OnAlarmReceiver.class);
PendingIntent pi=PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, i, 0);

mgr.setRepeating(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP, SystemClock.elapsedRealtime(), PERIOD, pi);


In this example, I am using setRepeating(). If you want a one-shot alarm, you would just use set(). Be sure to give the time for the alarm to start in the same time base as you use in the initial parameter to set(). In my example above, I am using AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP, so my time base is SystemClock.elapsedRealtime().

Here is a larger sample project showing this technique.
