Q:I have 6 months experience with Android, developing simple UI-based applications. Now I want to write applications targeting the Android core Kernel.  For example, I want to develop a framework which is not present in Android.  To achieve that, we have to write the code for the Kernel. I don't know where and how to start Android Kernel programming. 

If anybody knows the way to start it please help me.
