Q:How do I create a home-screen replacement application? Is there any information about the home-screen application available?

Can any application be a home-screen by just registering it with a CATEGORY_HOME intent?

A:Writing your own home screen application is possible. It is called the Launcher.

You can get the source code of the default Android Launcher via Git.

The project URL is:


  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher2.git


You can get the source code like this:

git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher2.git


That will create a directory called Launcher2 for you. Now you can get cracking and create your custom launcher.

If you need help with using Git then checkout Git's documentation section.
