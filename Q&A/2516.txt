Q:I'm using the new Android Marshmallow SDK and the method FloatMath.sqrt() is gone. What should I use now?

A:The documentations say this:


  Historically these methods were faster than the equivalent double-based
  java.lang.Math methods. On versions of Android with a JIT they
  became slower and have since been re-implemented to wrap calls to
  java.lang.Math. java.lang.Math should be used in preference.
  
  All methods were removed from the public API in version 23.
  
  @deprecated Use java.lang.Math instead.


This means the solution is to use the Math class:

(float)Math.sqrt(...)
