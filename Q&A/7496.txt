Q:I use ActionMode to select items in a grid. The problem is that I cannot recognize whether exactly the Done button is clicked. The only I can is to know that ActionMode is finished. But pressing Back finishes the ActionMode too. 
The desired behavior is to accept selection on Done click, and exit ActionMode on Back press.

I tried to use ActionMode.setCustomView() but it doesn't affect the Done button. The Activity.onBackPressed() is not called when ActionMode is started.

The one solution I've found is to use ActionBarSherlock and get the Done button manually:

View closeButton = findViewById(R.id.abs__action_mode_close_button); 


But it works on Android 2.x-3.x only, because on 4.x a native action bar is used.

A:Please don't do that as it's implementation specific and extremely non-standard.

You can use the onDestroyActionMode callback for when an action mode is dismissed.
