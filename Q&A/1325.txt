Q:I am creating a file to send as an attachment to an email. Now I want to delete the image after sending the email. Is there a way to delete the file?

I have tried myFile.delete(); but it didn't delete the file.



I'm using this code for Android, so the programming language is Java using the usual Android ways to access the SD card. I am deleting the file in the onActivityResult method, when an Intent is returned to the screen after sending an email.

A:File file = new File(selectedFilePath);
boolean deleted = file.delete();


where selectedFilePath is the path of the file you want to delete - for example:


  /sdcard/YourCustomDirectory/ExampleFile.mp3
