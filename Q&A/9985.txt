Q:Currently I'm using HttpClient, HttpPost to send data to my PHP server from an Android app but all those methods were deprecated in API 22 and removed in API 23, so what are the alternative options to it?

I searched everywhere but I didn't find anything.

A:The HttpClient documentation points you in the right direction:

org.apache.http.client.HttpClient:


  This interface was deprecated in API level 22.
  Please use openConnection() instead. Please visit this webpage for further details.


means that you should switch to java.net.URL.openConnection().

Here's how you could do it:

URL url = new URL("http://some-server");
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
conn.setRequestMethod("POST");

// read the response
System.out.println("Response Code: " + conn.getResponseCode());
InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(conn.getInputStream());
String response = org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toString(in, "UTF-8");
System.out.println(response);
