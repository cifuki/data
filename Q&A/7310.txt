Q:After changes to source and building with gradle in Android Studio (I/O preview) AI - 130.677228 the build fails with the following error:

Gradle: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileDebugAidl'.
> No signature of method: com.android.ide.common.internal.WaitableExecutor.waitForTasks() is applicable for argument types: () values: []
  Possible solutions: waitForAllTasks()
* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip'.


The second time running a build the build will succeed.

Using a gradle wrapper with version 1.6

This really sucks because it does a long build (non-incremental) after it fails the first time.

Is there a way to not have this failure?

EDIT to include build.gradle

buildscript {

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.4'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'android'

task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '1.6'
}

dependencies {

    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion "Google Inc.:Google APIs:17"
    buildToolsVersion "17"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 11
        targetSdkVersion 17
    }
    sourceSets {
        main {
            manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'
            java.srcDirs = ['src']
            resources.srcDirs = ['src']
            aidl.srcDirs = ['src']
            renderscript.srcDirs = ['src']
            res.srcDirs = ['res']
            assets.srcDirs = ['assets']
        }

        instrumentTest.setRoot('tests')
    }
}

A:I'm not sure how this is possible. It looks like you have a mismatch between the Gradle plugin itself and its dependencies that provides the WaitableExecutor class.

However you mention Gradle 1.5 and this is a problem.

The plugin version 0.3 was compatible with Gradle 1.3-1.4
The new version release last week, 0.4 is compatible with Gradle 1.6+

Make sure you use 0.4 and the new Gradle version.
