Q:Forget screenshots, is it posible to capture a video of the running application in android?
Rooted or non-rooted, I don't care, I want atleast 15fps.

Update: I don't want any external hardware. The intent is to make it perfectly portable and every frame is captured within Android OS. If it crosses the boundaries of the app sdk, I'm willing to go to OS level modifications but I would need a starting point.

A:Android 4.4 (KitKat) and higher devices have a shell utility for recording the Android device screen. Connect a device in developer/debug mode running KitKat with the adb utility over USB and then type the following:

adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/movie.mp4
(Press Ctrl-C to stop)
adb pull /sdcard/movie.mp4


Screen recording is limited to a maximum of 3 minutes.
