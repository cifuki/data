  How do I center text horizontally and vertical in a TextView in Android?  




I have a RelativeLayout (before it was a LinerLayout), that occupies all the screen and I want to put in the center of this Layout, a TextView. I try to do it with gravity = "center" layout_gravity = "center" and a few more, but it doesn't work.

Anybody knows how to center the TextView in the middle of the screen?

EDIT

Ok, I think I explained badly. I think the TextView is in the center, but what I want to center is the text in the TextView. Can I do this?

A:If your font size is big enough, it might look like it's not centered, because of the font padding.
Try using the already mentioned properties combined with android:includeFontPadding, something like this:

    android:gravity="center"
    android:includeFontPadding="false"
