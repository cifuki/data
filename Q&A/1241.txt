Q:I updated my project to the latest Play services classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.5.0-beta2'. I am also using the latest version of playservices in my app.gradle file as:

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:8.3.0'
compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:8.3.0'


However when I compile, Gradle throws exception as follows

Error:Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'. > File google-services.json is missing from module root folder. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.

A:You need to get the configuration file from the developer's site and paste it in the app level directory of your project.
