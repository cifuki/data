Q:After making a few changes I am getting an error


  Session 'app': Error Installing APKs


According to some it is because of Instant Run. 

On the latest Stable Android Studio 3.0, under Build, Execution, Deployment  I don't have any option for Instant Run, even checked in the settings search. Any clue where I might be able to disable it?

Update 1: Tried reinstalling. No change. 

Build number 171.4408382

Update 2: Gave reset a shot https://stackoverflow.com/a/19397632/1926621 still nothing.

Update 3: Not a duplicate. Must be something in the settings. A complete clean install/reset did it.
