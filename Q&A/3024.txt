Q:I need to view my SQLite db but I don't know how to do it. I've gone to http://www.sqlite.org/download.html and downloaded the command line shell for my OS, but when I run the program and type adb ... I get errors.

Note: I'm using Android Studio so I'm assuming I don't need to install anything extra because I recall Android Studio said it had all the SDK tools needed.

A:Easiest Way: Connect to Sqlite3 via ADB Shell

I haven't found any way to do that in Android Studio, but I access the db with a remote shell instead of pulling the file each time.

Find all info here:
http://developer.android.com/tools/help/sqlite3.html

1- Go to your platform-tools folder in a command prompt

2- Enter the command adb devices to get the list of your devices

C:\\Android\\adt-bundle-windows-x86_64\\sdk\\platform-tools>adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-xxxx   device


3- Connect a shell to your device:

C:\\Android\\adt-bundle-windows-x86_64\\sdk\\platform-tools>adb -s emulator-xxxx shell


4a- You can bypass this step on rooted device 

run-as <your-package-name> 


4b- Navigate to the folder containing your db file: 

cd data/data/<your-package-name>/databases/


5- run sqlite3 to connect to your db:

sqlite3 <your-db-name>.db


6- run sqlite3 commands that you like eg:

Select * from table1 where ...;



  Note: Find more commands to run below.
