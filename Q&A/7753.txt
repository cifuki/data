Q:i am trying to start the android emulator from eclipse classic (juno)
 and it keeps giving me this error:       


  ERROR: unknown skin name 'WVGA800' 


I developed my software using eclipse indigo, but since I installed eclipse juno and imported the same project it started to give me this error. any idea why? and how to resolve this issue?

A:My solution was to create a new custom virtual device from the android virtual device manager and use that.
