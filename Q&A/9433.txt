A:TLDR: You have to manually inflate the graph, add the keys/values to the defaultArgs, and set the graph on the navController. 

Step 1

The documentation tells you to set the graph in the <fragment> tag in your Activity's layout. Something like:

<fragment
    android:id="@+id/navFragment"
    android:name="androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment"
    app:graph="@navigation/nav_whatever"
    app:defaultNavHost="true"
    />


REMOVE the line setting the graph=.

Step 2

In the Activity that will be displaying your NavHostFragment, inflate the graph like so:

val navHostFragment = navFragment as NavHostFragment
val inflater = navHostFragment.navController.navInflater
val graph = inflater.inflate(R.navigation.nav_whatever)


Where navFragment is the id you gave your fragment in XML, as above.

Step 3 [Crucial!]

Create a bundle to hold the arguments you want to pass to your startDestination fragment and add it to the graph's default arguments:

val bundle = Bundle()
// ...add keys and values
graph.addDefaultArguments(bundle)


Step 4

Set the graph on the host's navController:

navHostFragment.navController.graph = graph
