Q:Has anyone managed to use RoundedBitmapDrawable? Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my understanding, it makes a circular image from a regular rectangular image.

What I've tried so far is this

RoundedBitmapDrawable.createRoundedBitmapDrawable(getResources(), BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), iconResource))


What I tried to achieve: transform any image to a circular image and show it using an ImageView.

In case I mixed things up and all that I said is non-sense. Is it possible (or simpler) to do it with any of the new framework? (Android L or new Support Library)

A:You need to set the corner radius.

Resources res = getResources();
Bitmap src = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(res, iconResource);
RoundedBitmapDrawable dr =
    RoundedBitmapDrawableFactory.create(res, src);
dr.setCornerRadius(Math.max(src.getWidth(), src.getHeight()) / 2.0f);
imageView.setImageDrawable(dr);
