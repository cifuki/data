Q:I don't need to call the phone number, I just need the dialer to open with the phone number already displayed. What Intent should I use to achieve this?

A:Two ways to achieve it.

1) Need to start the dialer via code, without user interaction.

You need Action_Dial,

use below code  it will open Dialer with number specified

Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_DIAL);
intent.setData(Uri.parse("tel:0123456789"));
startActivity(intent); 


The 'tel:' prefix is required, otherwhise the following exception will be thrown:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not execute method of the activity. 

Action_Dial doesn't require any permission.

If you want to initiate the call directly without user's interaction , You can use action Intent.ACTION_CALL. In this case, you must add the following permission in your AndroidManifest.xml:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE" />


2) Need user to click on Phone_Number string and start the call.

android:autoLink="phone" 


You need to use TextView with below property.

android:autoLink="phone" 
android:linksClickable="true" a textView property

You don't need to use intent or to get permission via this way.
