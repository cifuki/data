Q:I'm using a GridView for a game board. Recently some users have had problems with the board scrolling vertically (on Samsung Galaxy / Vibrant phones running 2.2) -- This bug does not occur on my Nexus One.

One user produced some screenshots of the problem.

How could I lock the GridView in place? Is there a way to disable scrolling?

A:Try to add or override setOnTouchListener for GridView,
then in onTouch method you can use code like this to 
make gridView not scrollable

Java

gridView.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() {

    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
        return event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE;
    }

});


Kotlin

gridView.setOnTouchListener { v, event ->
    event.action == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE
}
