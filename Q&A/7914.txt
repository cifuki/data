A:private void getDropboxIMGSize(Uri uri){
   BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
   options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
   BitmapFactory.decodeFile(new File(uri.getPath()).getAbsolutePath(), options);
   int imageHeight = options.outHeight;
   int imageWidth = options.outWidth;

}


no there is no way. You have to create a Bitmap object. if you use the inJustDecodeBounds flag the bitmap would not be loaded in momery. In fact BitmapFactory.decodeFile will return null. In my example uri is the phisical path to the image
