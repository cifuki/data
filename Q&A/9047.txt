Q:Is there any benchmark tests results comparing this two emulators ? 

I know that Genymotion is seems to be more faster when loading and rebooting the emulator,
but is there any tests show result  like, Camera, GPS, networking and etc.  ?

A:Have a look here for some informal benchmark comparisons. However, take these with a grain of salt because benchmark scores will vary greatly depending on the host system.

As for the items you want benchmarks for, not sure that camera/gps can even be benchmarked (what would you test), and networking is perfect since it uses VirtualBox, which has always had great virtual network support.

As a graphics/game developer, I find Genymotion unparalleled for running OpenGL code - on Genymotion it runs much smoother framerate wise, than using an x86+HAXM+HW GPU android emulator. Also, the integration of Google Apps/Services in Genymotion is fantastic. 

Compatibility is the only downside, since Genymotion only provides v4.1+ images there is no way to test compatibility on older android versions - but for these tests I just use the standard android emulator (which is fine since it is not as frequent as normal testing).

Update: As of January 2014, Genymotion supports Android v2.3.7 as well as v4.3 (with v4.4 in preview). This means it now covers all relevant android versions except Froyo (v2.2), which at this time accounts for only 1-2% of all devices :)
