Q:I get the impression that Android supports reflection. But does it really? How sensible would it be to rely on reflection heavily? What's the penalty?

A:Android supports reflection.

Once you've got a prototype running, you can benchmark and determine your bottlenecks.

If its reflection, then consider trying to cache interfaces and such to make it a one-off cost, rather than continually resolving the same interfaces from the same instances repeatedly.
