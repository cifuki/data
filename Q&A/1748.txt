Q:With the introduction of the Android Architecture Components library, several new classes were introduced, including AndroidViewModel and ViewModel. However, I'm having trouble figuring out the difference between these two classes. The documentation succinctly describes AndroidViewModel as follows:


  Application context aware ViewModel


I appreciate the brevity, but what exactly does this imply? When should we choose to use AndroidViewModel over ViewModel and vice-versa?

A:If you need to use context inside your viewmodel you should use AndroidViewModel, because it contains the application context (to retrieve the context call getApplication() ), otherwise use regular ViewModel.

EDIT

AndroidViewModel has Application Context.
We all know Having static Context instance is Evil!(can cause Memory Leak!!)

But, Having static Application instance is not bad than you think

Because, there is only one Application instance in our running application.

So, using & having Application instance in specific class is not problem generally.

But, if Application instance reference them, it is problem because of reference cycle problem.
