A:I hope this can help you:

File file = new File(selectedPath);
int file_size = Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(file.length()/1024));


Where the String selectedPath is the path to the file whose file size you want to determine.

file.length() returns the length of the file in bytes, as described in the Java 7 Documentation: 


  Returns the length, in bytes, of the file denoted by this abstract pathname, or 0L if the file does not exist. Some operating systems may return 0L for pathnames denoting system-dependent entities such as devices or pipes. 


Dividing by 1024 converts the size from bytes to kilobytes.
