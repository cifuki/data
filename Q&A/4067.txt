I've updated my sdk to the latest version (android 4.4) and I started the emulator, but now it seems not possible to rotate the screen with CTRL+F11, the screen change but all the applications don't change. I don't know if it's a related issue but I can see that even if I created a new emulator with men\xc3\xb9 hw button, now all the applications have the overflow button.

A:These appear to be bugs in the Android 4.4 emulator. You may wish to track the issues that I filed regarding the orientation change bug and the overflow affordance bug.

Thanks for pointing these out!
