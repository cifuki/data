Q:I want to display a Button inside the ListView.
The goal should be to click on the ListView line or on the button.

Click on the line it shows more info.
Click on the button it shows at the bottom more buttons.

The same as the GMAIL app.

On the right there is a checkbox and after clicking on the checkbox at the bottom, the button bar appears.

My problem is after inserting the button into the ListView, the button is not clickable.
If I add the to the LinearLayout from the button llButton.setClickable() it works. But, only the button. The ListView itself doesn't react on clicks anymore!

I have tried this example.

The same issue as above...

A:If you are using a custom Adapter the Button click inside a ListView will not work so you should try to use the following code to check for OnItemClickListener.

listId.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
   public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> list, View v, int pos, long id) {
      // Your code for item clicks
   }
});
