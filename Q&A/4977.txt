Q:Every time I am getting this error when running my project. I can do a Clean and then Run again, and it works. But it is not an optimal solution. Any ideas?

Error:Execution failed for task ':android:transformClassesAndResourcesWithProguardForRelease'.



  java.io.IOException: Failed to rename android\\build\\intermediates\\transforms\\proguard\\release\\folders\\3\\1f\\main\\classes.jar to android\\build\\intermediates\\transforms\\proguard\\release\\jars\\3\\1f\\classes.jar

A:This bug happens when the versions of SDK, Build Tools and Gradle Plugins doesn't match (in terms of compatibility). The solution is to verify if you are using the latest versions of them. The gradle plugins are placed in the build.gradle file of the project. Other versions are in the build.gradle file of the module. For example, for SDK 23, you must use the Build Tools 23.0.1 and gradle plugins version 1.3.1.

Clean the project after changing settings. (Solved my problem, and never seen it again.)
