Q:I Know people from Google have asked us not to put Scrollable view inside another Scrollable view but is there any official statement from them directing us not to do so?

A:Is this close enough?


  You should never use a
  HorizontalScrollView with a ListView,
  since ListView takes care of its own
  scrolling. Most importantly, doing
  this defeats all of the important
  optimizations in ListView for dealing
  with large lists, since it effectively
  forces the ListView to display its
  entire list of items to fill up the
  infinite container supplied by
  HorizontalScrollView.

UPDATE:

Since you may be forced to use a two dimensional scrollview, you may consider using this:

I haven't used this but it may be a reasonable approach.
