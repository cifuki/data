Q:Is there any reliable way to get a Context from a Service?

I want to register a broadcast receiver for ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED but I don't need my app to always get this information, so I don't put it in the Manifest. 

However, I can't have the broadcast receiver be killed by the GC when I need this information so I'm registering the broadcast receiver in a Service. 

Hence, I need a Context to to call registerReceiver().
 When I no longer need the ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED I unregister it.

Any tips?
