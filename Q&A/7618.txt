Q:I have android app in which one layout contains Linearlayout, ScrollView, TextView, EditView and Button. when I call from one activity to other this activity call and set layout which I have describe.

I would like to know when activity call there is by default EditView selected. and open the softkeyboard. I don't want to open that keyboard when activity start. but I want to open that softkeyboard on touch event of EditView.

How can I do that?

A:In your AndroidManifest.xml:

<activity android:name="com.your.package.ActivityName"
          android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden"  />


More details about windowSoftInputMode can be found here.

This setting will hide soft keyboard when user enters new Activity (even if EditText control gains the focus). Soft keyboard will be shown only when user clicks the edit box control.
