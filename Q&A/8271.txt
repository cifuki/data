Q:I've searched everywhere and I can't find a solution to this problem.

Basically I have a login screen and I'm trying to get a progress spinner to show up while it's logging in to the server (via a thread), and then dismiss it after the login is successful. It has to work while changing orientations.

I am using DialogFragment with the Android compatibility package to make a progress bar (can't find any documentation on it, only for basic\\alert dialog) because showDialog() is deprecated now. Right now I just show a custom message box as a login spinner.

In Summary:


How can I set up a Progress spinner with DialogFragment.
How can I dismiss it in another thread after orientation changes.

A:I know this is old question but I want to share much better solution for this 

According to Android Development Protip:   


  "Stop using ProgressDialog,Inline indicators are your friend"


As Roman Nurik states:




  This one's quick. Stop using ProgressDialog and other modal loading
  indicators. They're extremely interruptive and annoying, especially
  when:
  
  
  You see one every time you switch tabs.
  You can't Back out of   them.   
  They say "Please wait." No thanks, I'd rather just uninstall.
  
  
  Either show loading indicators inline with your content (e.g.
  http://developer.android.com/training/animation/crossfade.html) or better yet, load small amounts of data in the
  background so that you minimize the need to even show a loading
  indicator.
  
  More about progress & activity in the design guidelines.
