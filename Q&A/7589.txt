Q:So I was adding some stuff to my application manifest and I saw that I had a warning on my application tag:


  On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute android:fullBackupContent to specify an @xml resource which configures which files to backup.


And then I searched up for that. Apparently there are only 2 tags for that: <include> and <exclude>. I don't want to exclude any files from the backup as I don't have any local-depending files, and I don't need any <include> tags as


  <include>: Specifies a set of resources to back up, instead of having the system back up all data in your app by default.


When I saw that if I don't put any <include> tags, then the system will back up all data in your app by default, which is exactly what I want.

Now I have this question: should I add the backup_content.xml file, but empty as the default settings are good, or not add the file at all? (in which case Android Studio will complain)

A:Fast Solution:

AndroidManifest.xml

<application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:fullBackupContent="true"
    ...
    ...
    ...
</application>
