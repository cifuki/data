Q:Is it possible to use ProGuard for only obfuscation. I don't want ProGuard to remove any classes from my projects. My intention to use ProGuard is only for obfuscation so as to prevent reverse engineering.

A:Yes, by specifying

-dontshrink
-dontoptimize


You can find details on all configuration options in the ProGuard manual.

Note that shrinking and optimization may help preventing reverse engineering a bit.
