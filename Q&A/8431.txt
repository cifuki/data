Q:When android unbind a service I created (service.MyService), I see the
following DeadObjectException.

Can you please tell me how  what does this mean and can I fix this exception?

W/ActivityManager(  583): Exception when unbinding service
com.mycompany/.service.MyService
W/ActivityManager(  583): android.os.DeadObjectException
W/ActivityManager(  583):       at
android.os.BinderProxy.transact(Native Method)
W/ActivityManager(  583):       at
android.app.ApplicationThreadProxy.scheduleUnbindService(ApplicationThreadNative.java:516)
W/ActivityManager(  583):       at
com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService.removeConnectionLocked(ActivityManagerService.java:9609)
W/ActivityManager(  583):       at
com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService.killServicesLocked(ActivityManagerService.java:8515)
...


Thank you.

A:This means that your service had already stopped - either killed from the OS, or stopped from your application.

Does this problem happen every time you debug your project?

Override your service's onDestroy() method and watch what event flow leads to it. If you catch DeadObjectException without going through this method, your service should have been killed by the OS.
