A:You only have to install the skin for the Galaxy S6 to you AVD (Android Virtual Device). This is the most accurate way to emulate an S6 regarding the documentation that Samsung has.

Take a look at Install Samsung Galaxy S6 skin in your Android Emulator:


  For Samsung devices, Samsung provide emulator skins for its flagships
  devices like Galaxy S6, Galaxy S5 or Galaxy Note 4. In this tutorial,
  we\xe2\x80\x99re going to install Samsung Galaxy S6 Emulator skin but process is
  the same for all Emulator skins you want to install on Eclipse.


It talks about eclipse, but it's applicable for the Android Studio too.

You also have a Samsung Official video here which explains the same as the tutorial.

You also have this Samsung Testlab where you can test your apps in different Samsung devices which could be more interesting for you than the skin.
