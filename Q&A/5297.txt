Q:How do I disable the Zoom In button on the Google Map? 

I tried looking for commands like:
map.getUiSettings().setZoomControlsEnabled(true)...SOMETHING but nothing exists.

I want to leave creating my own buttons for zooming as a last resort.

UPDATE: I should clarify, I only want to disable the Zoom In button, not the whole Zoom Control.

A:the setting you used is right, but to disable it, it should be false.

map.getUiSettings().setZoomControlsEnabled(false);


hope I got your question right..

Edit

Unfortunately, you can't hide one zoom buttons, what you can do is hide both buttons and create your own custom zoom control and place them on the your map.
