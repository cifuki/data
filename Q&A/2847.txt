Q:I'm not sure what changed but the physical keyboard from my computer no longer works for the emulator (running kitkat in Nexus 5, x86). When i look in AVD at the device's advanced settings, there's nothing for a hardware keyboard. Where is this setting?

A:In the advanced settings of a virtual device in Android Studio 1.0.2 AVD Manager, there is actually a checkbox that allows to enable keyboard input without editing the config.ini by hand.

Tools → Android → AVD Manager → pencil icon (shown in picture) → Show Advanced Settings (scroll to bottom) → Enable Keyboard Input
