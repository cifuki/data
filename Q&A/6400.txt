Q:I am starting Android Development using Eclipse. I have downloaded all the required software but I am having the same problem as discussed here. Now I do not find the solution of the problem on that discussion so let me rewrite the problem again,

When I load Eclipse and create a new Android project, it keeps on waiting for the ADT to load. To figure out what is wrong I went to preferences and tried to put the location of the ADT I created in it but it keeps giving me this error when I put the address of ADT,


  Could not find folder 'tools' inside SDK 'E:\\Documents and
  Settings\\Fahad\\android-sdks\\'..


I would be very thankful if someone could help me out with this problem.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT:
I created the foolder tools manually, now I am getting this error,

A:If you install Eclipse properly then:


Start Eclipse
From the menu bar, select Window > Preferences > Android 
For Android location, browse the folder in which you install Android SDKs.
In Android SDKs folder, rename the folder platforms-tools to tools.
Select the folder Android SDKs through Preferences dialog box.
