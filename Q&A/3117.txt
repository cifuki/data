Q:Steps to reproduce:


create a android project "MyApp"
import ActionBarSherlock(ABS),Directional ViewPager(DVP), or any other open source library which use android support library.
Add the libraries to the project "MyApp" 


Console log:

[2013-04-17 14:27:12 - MyApp] Found 2 versions of android-support-v4.jar in the dependency list,
[2013-04-17 14:27:12 - MyApp] but not all the versions are identical (check is based on SHA-1 only at this time).
[2013-04-17 14:27:12 - MyApp] All versions of the libraries must be the same at this time.

[2013-04-17 14:27:12 - MyApp] Jar mismatch! Fix your dependencies


I know i am suppose to delete android-support-v4.jar from libs folder and keep only one copy for all. 
But, that is not solving my problem. 

When i try to delete the android-support-v4.jar from MyApp, it gives me the following error.

 Problems encountered while deleting resources.
 Could not delete 'C:\\Users\\santhosh\\My_Workspace\\MyApp\\libs\\android-support-v4.jar'.


When I try to delete the android-support-v4.jar from ABS, it gives me the following error

 ????? cannot be resolved to a type error.


I have tried to clean the project, Fix Project Properties. Restart eclipse, Build, import and add again. I have tried to copy the support jar in libs folder from one library to other. delete the support jar in both libraries and add it to the MyApp project. Nothing has worked for me.  

if i try to add single library, it works fine. i am facing the problem when trying to add 2 or more libraries to a single project.

error getting when I add two libraries in MyApp:

The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. 
Cannot find the class file for android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity. 
Fix the build path then try building this project MyApp Unknown Java Problem
The type android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files MyActivity.java/MyApp/src/com/santhosh/myapp    line 10 Java Problem
Jar mismatch! Fix your dependencies MyApp Unknown Android Dependency Problem

A:Use a Library Project just for the Support Library

As of ADT 22, using Eclipse Juno 

I don't think any of the above are really the best answers.  I also don't think it is recommended to use the external jar function in Eclipse anymore (AFAIK).

Rather, what worked for me is to create a separate empty library project.  

Then use  Android tools > Add Support Library to get the latest version you need or want. 

Then remove the support lib jar from all other projects.

Finally, for every project that requires it, add a reference to your new Library project

(project properties) > Android > (Library box) > Add...

Then all your projects will have a single source to use and update the support library.  This also makes javadocs easier to get working.

For info on how to setup the javadocs see:
