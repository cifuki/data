Q:I decompiled an apk file using dex2jar and opened the resulting jar file in jd-gui. I can view almost all of the code nicely but one section - the constants - displays only // INTERNAL ERROR // and nothing else. Is there a way to retrieve the constants?

A:Anyone passing by this question should look at this instead: https://github.com/deathmarine/Luyten

Using this instead of jd-gui, I was able to successully view all code which showed as INTERNAL ERROR on jd-gui.

You can also try Jadx: https://github.com/skylot/jadx
