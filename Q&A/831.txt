Q:I need to take screenshots of an android application running on an emulator in Eclipse Galileo.

Is there a built-in feature for this or do I have to download a plugin of some sorts?

A:You can take a screenshot if you open the Android view "devices" (under Window --> Show View --> Other... --> Android --> Devices).  Click on the device or emulator you want to take a screen shot of, then click the "Screen Capture" button (it looks like a little picture, and it should be next to a stop sign button).  Occasionally the device won't immediately load the picture; sometimes you have to close/reopen the screen capture window.

This is equivalent to taking a picture via DDMS, but you can do it in Eclipse instead of opening another application.
