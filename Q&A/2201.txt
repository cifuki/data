Q:I tried to do this

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    t=new TextView(this); 

    t=(TextView)findViewById(R.id.TextView01); 
    t.setText("Step One: blast egg");

    try {
        Thread.sleep(10000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    t.setText("Step Two: fry egg");


but for some reason, only the second text shows up when I run it.  I think it might have something to do with the Thread.sleep() method blocking. So can someone show me how to implement a timer "asynchronously"?

Thanks.

A:I just posted this answer in the android-discuss google group

If you are just trying to add text to the view so that it displays "Step One: blast egg Step Two: fry egg" Then consider using t.appendText("Step Two: fry egg");  instead of t.setText("Step Two: fry egg");

If you want to completely change what is in the TextView so that it says "Step One: blast egg" on startup and then it says "Step Two: fry egg" at a time later you can always use a 

Runnable example sadboy gave

Good luck
