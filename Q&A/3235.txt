Q:I am disappointed at the lack of documentation of WebView and related stuff.

(unless you think the following is propert documetation)


  public void setLoadWithOverviewMode
  (boolean overview) 
  
  Set whether the
  WebView loads a page with overview
  mode


and:


  public synchronized void setUseWideViewPort (boolean use)
  
  Tell the WebView to use the wide viewport


So: What is "Overview mode" ? what is "Wide viewport" ?

ps: I tried to look for webkit related docs but could not find it.

A:Apparently:

setLoadWithOverviewMode(true) loads the WebView completely zoomed out

setUseWideViewPort(true) makes the Webview have a normal viewport (such as a normal desktop browser), while when false the webview will have a viewport constrained to its own dimensions (so if the webview is 50px*50px the viewport will be the same size)
