Q:Now I need to uninstall the App every time before Run\\Debug it in Android Studio. Because I need to re-create the database before I run \\debug the app. I know I can run the command 

adb uninstall [package_name]


in terminal to clear the files under /data/data/[package_name]. But it's not convenient way if I have to execute the command every time. I hope the 

adb uninstall


command can be executed automatically when I click Run\\Debug button.

A:adb uninstall <package_name>


can be used to uninstall an app via your PC. If you want this to happen automatically every time you launch your app via Android Studio, you can do this:


In Android Studio, click the drop down list to the left of Run button, and select Edit configurations...
Click on app under Android Application, and in General Tab, find the heading 'Before Launch'
Click the + button, select Run external tool, click the + button in the popup window.
Give some name (Eg adb uninstall) and description, and type adb in Program: and uninstall <your-package-name> in Parameters:. 
Make sure that the new item is selected when you click Ok in the popup window.


Note: If you do not have adb in your PATH environment variable, give the full path to adb in Program: field (eg /home/user/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb).
