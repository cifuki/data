Q:I have added this line to my build.gradle

compile group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents' , name: 'httpclient-android' , version: '4.3.5'


and I want to use MultipartEntityBuilder in my code. However Android studio doesn't add the library to my code.
Can anyone help me with this?

A:if you are using target sdk as 23 add below code in your build.gradle

android{
 useLibrary  'org.apache.http.legacy'
}


additional note here: dont try using the gradle versions of those files. they are broken (28.08.15). I tried over 5 hours to get it to work. it just doesnt.
not working:

compile 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:4.4.1'
compile 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5'


another thing dont use:

'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient-android:4.3.5.1'


its referring 21 api level.
