Q:Does anyone knows an alternative to Android's webview component ? For some reasons, it's functionality's are insufficient for me : I need to be able to catch every single request to some url, when i'm browsing a wml page (wap). Anyway, I need to be able to do stuff that Android's webview is not made for.
I thought "hey, let's play with the source code, I'm pretty sure that webviews are using apache.org librairies to access internet".
Oh boy was I mistaken. Webviews use native code, and that's where I'm stuck.

So I was wondering if anyone knew of another web browser view, in pure java, that would be open source and nice. It's not a problem if it's slow, i'm displaying some basic wap pages...

Thanks in advance.

A:You can extend WebView's functionality by using setWebViewClient & setWebChromeClient.

WebView.setWebViewClient(new MyWebViewClient());
WebView.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient() {..}


You can handle each and every request sent/received from the WebView by overriding the below methods:

public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {..}
public void onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap favicon) {..}
public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {..}
