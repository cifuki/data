Q:I'm trying to do this:

    BluetoothAdapter bt = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
    if (bt == null){
        //Does not support Bluetooth
        status.setText("Your device does not support Bluetooth");
    }else{
        //Magic starts. Let's check if it's enabled
        if (!bt.isEnabled()){
            Intent enableIntent = new Intent(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE);
            startActivityForResult(enableIntent, REQUEST_ENABLE_BT);
        }   
    }


But I get this error:


  REQUEST_ENABLE_BT cannot be resolved to a variable


How can I fix it?

A:REQUEST_ENABLE_BT is a request code that you provide.  It's really just a number that you provide for onActivityResult.  It will be the requestCode (first parameter) of onActivityResult when the activity returns.  You could put any number you want as long as it's consistent in the return method.

In other words, put a line like this in the top of your Activity:

private final static int REQUEST_ENABLE_BT = 1;
