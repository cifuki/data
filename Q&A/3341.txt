Q:Using Eclipse.   Say I have a project 'ProjectA' in the eclipseworkspace (in a folder ProjectA).   I want to copy the project but with a new name (ProjectB)  and have all the references in the new project adjusted.   I can't find much help for what I thought would be a vary basic operation.   I want to try out variations on the original design/code and creating a copy seemed the obvious way to go about it.

Any suggestions please.

A:I need it also today and i got the answer from my co-worker.


you just copy your project into new one (ctrl+c & ctrl+v).
you change package-name in your manifest
After that you must rename your main package with refactor. Don't forget to select.
Just change your application name in manifest 

application android:icon="@drawable/icon" android:label="new name"


Hope i didn't forget something and it helps you
