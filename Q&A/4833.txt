Q:I have been using Eclipse for Android (most up to date version), for a while with no problems with the Logcat. For an unknown reason, Logcat is no longer retaining the debug messages. Logcat is getting cleared in about 5 seconds . Is there any way to prevent the auto-clearing of Logcat messages? Otherwise I am unable to read the messages.

A:Change your LogCat buffer length:

Window / Preferences / Android / LogCat / Maximum number of LogCat messages in buffer _

Set it to 0 for unlimited size (thanks to the commenter below)
