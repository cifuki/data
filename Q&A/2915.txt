Q:When I have a target API of 23 on Android M Preview 3, I cannot seem to acquire the Manifest.permission.WRITE_SETTTINGS permission. 

 requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS},
              101);


Request permission doesn't bring up the dialog I would expect, but if I make the following call without this permission,

 RingtoneManager.setActualDefaultRingtoneUri(activity, RingtoneManager.TYPE_RINGTONE, ringUri);


The call will except because I don't have the permission.

I'm not sure where to go from here. Is there a new ringtone API for 23? Or did this permission change just make it impossible for any non-system apps to change the ringtone?

A:To use WRITE_SETTINGS, based on the docs:


Have the <uses-permission> element in the manifest as normal.
Call Settings.System.canWrite() to see if you are eligible to write out settings.
If canWrite() returns false, start up the ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS activity so the user can agree there to allow your app to actually write to settings.


In other words, writing to settings is now a double-opt-in (agree to install, agree separately in Settings to allow), akin to device admin APIs, accessibility services, etc.

Also note that I have not tried using these yet â€” this is based on research that I did yesterday on Android 6.0 changes.
