            How do you have the code pause for a couple of seconds in android?

I am stuck with a problem, I want to wait 10 second because I want my application to start the code below after that 10 sec but without stopping that person from clicking anything else in the application (without calling Thread.sleep();).

try {
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Log.v("msg", "WAIT CheckFrequencyRun");
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thread.sleep(10000); // giving time to connect to wifi
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0
 \xc2\xa0 } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0// TODO Auto-generated catch block
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0e.printStackTrace();
 \xc2\xa0 }
 \xc2\xa0 //if no network
 \xc2\xa0 if(wifiManager.getConnectionInfo().getNetworkId()==-1){
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0//stop wifi
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0wifiManager.setWifiEnabled(false);
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Log.v("msg", "no connection");
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0handler.postDelayed(this, checkInterval);
 \xc2\xa0 }
 \xc2\xa0 //else connection
 \xc2\xa0 else{
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Log.v("msg", "connection");
 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0onDestroy();
 \xc2\xa0 }

A:You never want to call thread.sleep() on the UI thread as it sounds like you have figured out. This freezes the UI and is always a bad thing to do. You can use a separate Thread and postDelayed

This SO answer shows how to do that as well as several other options

Handler

TimerTask

You can look at these and see which will work best for your particular situation
