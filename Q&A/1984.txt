Q:I'd like to save some simple data. On the iPhone, I can do it with NSUserDefaults in Objective-C.

What is the similar command here in Android?

I'm just saving a few variables, to be reused as long as the application is installed. I don't want to use a complicated database just to do that.

A:This is the most simple solution I've found:

//--Init
int myvar = 12;


//--SAVE Data
SharedPreferences preferences = context.getSharedPreferences("MyPreferences", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);  
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
editor.putInt("var1", myvar);
editor.commit();


//--READ data       
myvar = preferences.getInt("var1", 0);  


Where 'context' is the current context (e.g. in an activity subclass could be this).
