Q:Since API level 16 (Jelly Bean), there is the possibility to add actions to a notification with

builder.addAction(iconId, title, intent);


But when I add an action to a notification and the action is pressed, the notification is not going to be dismissed.
When the notification itself is being clicked, it can be dismissed with

notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;


or

builder.setAutoCancel(true);


But obviously, this has nothing to with the actions associated to the notification.

Any hints? Or is this not part of the API yet? I did not find anything.

A:When you called notify on the notification manager you gave it an id - that is the unique id you can use to access it later (this is from the notification manager:

notify(int id, Notification notification)


To cancel, you would call:

cancel(int id)


with the same id.  So, basically, you need to keep track of the id or possibly put the id into a Bundle you add to the Intent inside the PendingIntent?
