Q:With a Preview 1 of Android Studio 2.2 Google released a new layout in its support library: ConstraintLayout. With ConstraintLayout it is easier to use a Design tool in Android Studio, but I didn't find a way to use relative sizes (percents or 'weights' like in LinearLayout). Is there a way to define the constraints based on percents? E.g. make a View take 40% of a screen, create 20% margin between views, set a View's width to 50% of another View's width?

A:You can currently do this in a couple of ways. 

One is to create guidelines (right-click the design area, then click add vertical/horizontal guideline). You can then click the guideline's "header" to change the positioning to be percentage based. Finally, you can constrain views to guidelines. 

Another way is to position a view using bias (percentage) and to then anchor other views to that view.

That said, we have been thinking about how to offer percentage based dimensions. I can't make any promise but it's something we would like to add.
