Q:I've just recently started getting an error any time I interact with the Android SDK and AVD Manager in Eclipse Helios

I've tried reinstalling the Eclipse plugin and the Android SDK but to no avail.

If I go to the "Installed packages" page and click refresh (or install or remove a package) I get a popup box saying that 

'Android SDK Content Loader' has encountered a problem. 
parseSdkContent failed 
java.lang.NullPointerException.


Here is the full log:

Stack Trace

Session Data

eclipse.buildId=M20100909-0800
java.version=1.6.0_20
java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.

Command-line arguments:  -os linux -ws gtk -arch x86 -product org.eclipse.epp.package.java.product


Has anyone else encountered this recently? 
It doesn't seem to be affecting actual Android development but its just kinda annoying.

A:The issue is in the your-avd-name.ini that is located at ...\\<user-profile>\\.android on your Windows machine (if you're Windows user). When any error occurs during the avd.ini parser, the Google ADT plugin tries to access a map that is null. The workaround is to delete the offending .ini file and recreate your avd(s).
