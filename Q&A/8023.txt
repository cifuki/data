Q:I need to add some 3rd party APKs to my AOSP build. What folder should I keep these APKs so that when I build the code and the image is created, it is installed in the emulator?

It looks like the system apps are kept in the packages/app folder so I need to know where the third party APKs are kept.

A:Adding third party APKs to the build is definitely possible.

Also APKs and APPs with source code go to the same place; the package/app folder.

Adding a new APK to the build

In the AOSP root add the folder:

<aosp root>/package/app/< yourappfolder >

Then inside this folder add:


empty Android.mk
< yourapp.apk >


The android make file should have the reference to your apk, add this to your Android.mk:

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := optional

LOCAL_MODULE := < your app folder name >

LOCAL_CERTIFICATE := < desired key >

LOCAL_SRC_FILES := < app apk filename >

LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS := APPS

LOCAL_MODULE_SUFFIX := $(COMMON_ANDROID_PACKAGE_SUFFIX)

include $(BUILD_PREBUILT)


Create an entry in the commons.mk (usually in build/target/product) for your apk add the line (check where all the others are)

PRODUCT_PACKAGES += < what you have defined in LOCAL_MODULE, it should be your app folder name >


Compile the AOSP and you have a brand new app installed on the system.
