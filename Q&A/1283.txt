A:As usual, by pressing F2 on the package name, you can rename or change the package name, and also by right-clicking and then select Rename option, you can change or rename the package name.

When you press F2, it will show you the dialog box as:



In this dialog, don't forget to check the "Update references" checkbox because by making "check" to this check-box, it will make changes to all the references of the package which are referred by other components of project.
