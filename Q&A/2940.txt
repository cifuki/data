Q:I updated the Google Play Services version from the revision 29 to 30 using the Android SDK Manager, but after updating the directory "<sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject" disappeared, leaving only the directories "docs" and " samples".

I've tried uninstall and reinstall several times but always happens to miss the directory "libproject".

Anyone had this problem with the update?

I'm using Debian Linux 8.4 (jessie) although not believe it has anything to do with the problem.

A:Looks like Google just broke down Google Play Services into multiple libraries. You'll find them in <sdk>/extras/google/m2repository/com/google/android/gms, if you also updated Google Repository through the SDK Manager.

The individual libraries are in aar format, so you'll have to extract the jar yourself, if that's what you're after.
