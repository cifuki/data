Q:I'm planning a cross-platform app. Is it possible to implement push notifications on all 3 of them (iphone, android, windowsphone) using only one API/module?
 Is there any other alternative? What needs to be done server-side? Please point me in the right direction. (Documentation, example code if exists)
Thanks in advance.

A:In Android push notification is handled by Google c2dm servers and same for iphone(Apple Servers) and Windows(MPNS). You have to register your app to all three services separately to enable push notification in your app. So while registering user you should send the the information which phone user is currently using to your server and save it in user table and then you have to call remote methods to appropriate servers for sending push notification to particular user.
