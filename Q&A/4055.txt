Q:Is there any way to trigger the SwipeRefreshLayout programmatically? The animation should start and the onRefresh method from the OnRefreshListener interface should get called.

A:if you are using the new swipeRefreshLayout intoduced in 5.0 

As the image shown above you just need to add the following line to trigger the swipe refresh layout programmatically 

 mSwipeRefreshLayout.post(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            mSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(true);
        }
    });


if you simply call 

 mSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(true);


it won't trigger the circle to animate, so by adding the above line u just make a delay in the UI thread so that it shows the circle animation inside the ui thread. 

By calling mSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(true) the OnRefreshListener will NOT get executed

In order to stop the circular loading animation call mSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(false)
