Q:public class Utils {
    public static List<Message> getMessages() {
        //File file = new File("file:///android_asset/helloworld.txt");
        AssetManager assetManager = getAssets();
        InputStream ims = assetManager.open("helloworld.txt");    
     }
}


I am using this code trying to read a file from assets. I tried two ways to do this. First, when use File I received FileNotFoundException, when using AssetManager getAssets() method isn't recognized. 
Is there any solution here?

A:Here is what I do in an activity for buffered reading extend/modify to match your needs

BufferedReader reader = null;
try {
    reader = new BufferedReader(
        new InputStreamReader(getAssets().open("filename.txt")));

    // do reading, usually loop until end of file reading  
    String mLine;
    while ((mLine = reader.readLine()) != null) {
       //process line
       ...
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    //log the exception
} finally {
    if (reader != null) {
         try {
             reader.close();
         } catch (IOException e) {
             //log the exception
         }
    }
}


EDIT : My answer is perhaps useless if your question is on how to do it outside of an activity. If your question is simply how to read a file from asset then the answer is above.

UPDATE :

To open a file specifying the type simply add the type in the InputStreamReader call as follow.

BufferedReader reader = null;
try {
    reader = new BufferedReader(
        new InputStreamReader(getAssets().open("filename.txt"), "UTF-8")); 

    // do reading, usually loop until end of file reading 
    String mLine;
    while ((mLine = reader.readLine()) != null) {
       //process line
       ...
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    //log the exception
} finally {
    if (reader != null) {
         try {
             reader.close();
         } catch (IOException e) {
             //log the exception
         }
    }
}


EDIT

As @Stan says in the comment, the code I am giving is not summing up lines. mLine is replaced every pass. That's why I wrote //process line. I assume the file contains some sort of data (i.e a contact list) and each line should be processed separately.

In case you simply want to load the file without any kind of processing you will have to sum up mLine at each pass using StringBuilder() and appending each pass.

ANOTHER EDIT

According to the comment of @Vincent I added the finally block.

Also note that in Java 7 and upper you can use try-with-resources to use the AutoCloseable and Closeable features of recent Java. 

CONTEXT

In a comment @LunarWatcher points out that getAssets() is a class in context. So, if you call it outside of an activity you need to refer to it and pass the context instance to the activity.

ContextInstance.getAssets();


This is explained in the answer of @Maneesh. So if this is useful to you upvote his answer because that's him who pointed that out.
