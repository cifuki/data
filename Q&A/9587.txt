Q:I have a base class for my all of activities (ActivityBase) that itself derives from android.app.Activity.  In onCreate I want to execute some conditional logic based on the currently executing child class.  If SomeCustomActivity and AnotherCustomActivity both extend ActivityBase, how can I determine in the parent class (ActivityBase) which of the two is the currently executing one?

A:Use instanceof operator.

Supposing you have a base class and two subclasses named Base, SubOne and SubTwo, if you want to check if a variable ref is an instance of SubOne or SubTwo you'd say:

if(ref instanceof SubOne){
}
else if(ref instanceof SubTwo){
}


Note that: (ref instanceof Base) will always return true though.
