Q:I've been using the new preview of android studio and really like it. But recently my project won't build. I get the following error:

Gradle: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':TestProj:compileDebug'.
> Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip'.


Question is how do I enable the stack trace so I can get to the root of the error. As it is I really have no idea what's causing this.

A:If you are using the Gradle Wrapper (the recommended option in Android Studio), you enable stacktrace by running gradlew compileDebug --stacktrace from the command line in the root folder of your project (where the gradlew file is). 

If you are not using the gradle wrapper, you use gradle compileDebug --stacktrace instead (presumably).

You don't really need to run with --stacktrace though, running gradlew compileDebug by itself, from the command line, should tell you where the error is.

I based this information on this comment:
