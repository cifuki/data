Q:I have TextView for showing time. I want to use Android's DataBinding plugin.

For formatting time I am using DateUtils.formatDateTime(context, int, int) method which takes Context instance. Is it possible to get context include  element? Or do I have to use old school way?

Thanks

A:Thought I should answer instead of putting in a comment. You'll have more options when rc2 is released. In rc1, you can pass the context in a variable to the Binding, then pass it as a parameter to the method. Alternatively, you can create a custom attribute for data binding:

@BindingAdapter({"timeMillis", "dateFlags"})
public static void setDateText(TextView view, int timeMillis, int dateFlags) {
    view.setText(DateUtils.formatDateTime(view.getContext(), timeMillis,
                 dateFlags));
}


And then use it in your TextView:

<TextView ... app:timeMillis="@{timeVar}" app:dateFlags="@{dateFlags}"/>
