Q:Scrollable views such as the ListView have a fade out of the content along the edges where there is more content in that direction.  How can I turn this fading off?  I know you can change the cacheColorHint as discussed here: http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/listview-backgrounds.html but that is not what I am looking for and will not achieve what I am looking for in this case.

I want to disable the fade completely or be able to reduce the size and or transparency of it.  Is this possible?

A:I can't actually test it right now, but I believe fadingEdge is what you're looking for:

android:fadingEdge="none"

or 

listView.setVerticalFadingEdgeEnabled(false);
