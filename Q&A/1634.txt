Q:In my drawable folder I have a few images and they all reference perfect, but when I try and add any more images with the exact same size in the same folder, and try to reference it, is flags up an error "Failed to convert @drawable/picture into a drawable". I have tried the same image with a different name and it just keeps giving me that error. I have also tried it in a different XML layout and the same thing. Also the name of the picture have been "jack", "abc", "question_mark" as you can see there are strictly in the rules of the what characters you can use, and still the error message keeps coming up. Any advice would be great on how to fix the problem, thanks.

A:Restart Eclipse (unfortunately) and the problem will go away.
