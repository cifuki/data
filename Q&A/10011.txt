I'm new to android with almost no knowledge about Java and XML.
I'm learning it through pdfs that i'm getting on net.
I have learnt about Toast, a bit about Intents but me not able to understand anything about Bundles. I have understood that they are used to pass data from one activity to another but I'm not able to implement this.

please give a simple example to implement the same.

as for example I have just created two activities namely , Main_Activity and Other_Activity, and i haven't done anything to them yet.

Please give the simplest example so that i can learn to implement.

Thanks in advance!!

A:For example :

In MainActivity : 

Intent intent = new Intent(this, OtherActivity.class);
intent.putExtra(OtherActivity.KEY_EXTRA, yourDataObject);
startActivity(intent);


In OtherActivity :

public static final String KEY_EXTRA = "com.example.yourapp.KEY_BOOK";

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

  String yourDataObject = null;

  if (getIntent().hasExtra(KEY_EXTRA)) {
      yourDataObject = getIntent().getStringExtra(KEY_EXTRA);
  } else {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Activity cannot find  extras " + KEY_EXTRA);
  }
  // do stuff
}
