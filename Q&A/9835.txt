Q:Is there a functionality inside android studio to do things like this.
Basically my gradle script reads parameter named version based on which it sets dependency version of a certain library.
So when I do gradlew -Pversion=\xe2\x80\x981.2.3' I get this string inside gradle. But this only works if I invoke gradle from console.

Is there a way to pass parameters to gradle when started using configuration for project inside Android Studio (pressing little play triangle)?

NOTE:I did find Gradle VM options and Script prameters under default configs but adding -Pversion=\xe2\x80\x981.2.3' there doesn't seem to have an effect.

A:In order to provide parameter to run option of Android Studio you should setup them under AndroidStudios Compile Preferences

AndroidStudio > Preferences...

Under Compiler: ComandLineOptions
