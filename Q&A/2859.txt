Q:I am developing an application. And i need to set the symbol of Indian rupee on text view which is set with the text as amount.

Symbol:



I am having the font or .TTF file of this in Assets/fonts folder.

And i tried to use it as :

Typeface typeFace_Rupee = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(),fonts/Rupee_Foradian.ttf");
TextView tvRupee = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textview_rupee_mlsaa);
tvRupee.setTypeface(typeFace_Rupee);

// Tried to set symbol on text view as follows.
tvRupee.setText("`");


As above setting font i got null pointer error.

In word file after choosing font and typing ` we got the symbol. but it is not working in android.

So what steps should i follow to do this...

A:Hi use this in Strings 

For print rupee symbol:
      <string name="Rs">\\u20B9</string>

For print Rs text:
      <string name="rs">\\u20A8</string>
