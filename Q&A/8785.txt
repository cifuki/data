This must be possible with 4.4, but I found no documentation on this yet - anyone knows how to make the status-bar / system-ui transparent/translucent ?

A:Here you go - http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.4.html#UI


  Translucent system bars
  
  You can now make the system bars partially translucent with new
  themes, Theme.Holo.NoActionBar.TranslucentDecor and
  Theme.Holo.Light.NoActionBar.TranslucentDecor. By enabling translucent
  system bars, your layout will fill the area behind the system bars, so
  you must also enable fitsSystemWindows for the portion of your layout
  that should not be covered by the system bars.
  
  If you're creating a custom theme, set one of these themes as the
  parent theme or include the windowTranslucentNavigation and
  windowTranslucentStatus style properties in your theme.
