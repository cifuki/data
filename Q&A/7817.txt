Q:I am new Android coder and I have problem with requesting updates for my localization.

I working with tutorials from http://developer.android.com/training/location/receive-location-updates.html .

My application can handle exceptions, getting latitude and longitute properly, and geocoder can handle displaying the adress. But I ask for location only once - or when location changes. I would like to do time intervals. For now I started implementing code from the tutorials and it looks like that:

public class MainActivity extends Activity implements 
GooglePlayServicesClient.ConnectionCallbacks,
GooglePlayServicesClient.OnConnectionFailedListener,
LocationListener {

private static final int MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND = 1000;

public static final int UPDATE_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS = 5;
private static final long UPDATE_INTERVAL =
          MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND * UPDATE_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS;

private static final int FASTEST_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS = 1;
private static final long FASTEST_INTERVAL =
          MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND * FASTEST_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS;

private TextView tvStatus;
private TextView tvLatitude;
private TextView tvLongitude;

LocationRequest mLocationRequest;
LocationClient mLocationClient;
Location mCurrentLocation;

boolean bNetworkEnabled;
boolean bGPSEnabled;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    tvStatus = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.tvStatus);
    tvLatitude = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.tvLatitude);
    tvLongitude = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.tvLongitude);

    mLocationRequest = LocationRequest.create();
    mLocationRequest.setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY);
    mLocationRequest.setInterval(UPDATE_INTERVAL);
    mLocationRequest.setFastestInterval(FASTEST_INTERVAL);
    mLocationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);

    checkProviders();
}


So there are already intervals implemented and location request. But in the link I gave before there is a comment that I should use somewhere requestLocationUpdates() (probably onCreate(), onStart() and removal of request on onStop()), but I have problem with it. So, Eclipse shows me 3 methods:

requestLocationUpdates(LocationRequest request, LocationListener listener)
requestLocationUpdates(LocationRequest request, PendingIntent CallbackIntent)
requestLocationUpdates(LocationRequest request, LocationListener listener, Looper looper)


So the first one I think is most right in this place. What should I place in LocationListener slot? I ask for help with little explanation how it works.

A:You are implementing LocationListener in your activity MainActivity. The call for concurrent location updates will therefor be like this:

mLocationClient.requestLocationUpdates(mLocationRequest, this);


Be sure that the LocationListener you're implementing is from the google api, that is import this:

import com.google.android.gms.location.LocationListener;


and not this:

import android.location.LocationListener;


and it should work just fine.

It's also important that the LocationClient really is connected before you do this. I suggest you don't call it in the onCreate or onStart methods, but in onResume. It is all explained quite well in the tutorial for Google Location Api: https://developer.android.com/training/location/index.html
