Q:In android studio,you can edit 9 patches directly from with the IDE. But is it also possible to convert an png image to 9-patch using the IDE? (similar to the android 9-patch tool provided by the SDK).

A:Well I don't think there is any tool in Android Studio but you can do this by Android Asset Studio

Android Asset Studio Simple Nine-patch Generator

This is a very handy tool to create simple 9 patch images for all dpi with a clean user interface.
