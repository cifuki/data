Q:I am trying to make a drag-and-drop list for a little game app I am writing.

There are 6 entries in the list. However the library I added required a Cursor object that talks to a DB. This is overkill for my situation.

Is there a way to create a Cursor object that is based on a memory-based data structure like an array? Is there a way I can used a hard-coded array as my Cursor?

Thanks

A:Check out the MatrixCursor documentation. Check for instance this example.

String[] columns = new String[] { "_id", "item", "description" };

MatrixCursor matrixCursor= new MatrixCursor(columns);
startManagingCursor(matrixCursor);

matrixCursor.addRow(new Object[] { 1, "Item A", "...." });

SimpleCursorAdapter adapter = 
        new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.layout_row, matrixCursor, ...);

setListAdapter(adapter);
