Q:I have an apk which I've signed and uploaded to Android Market, and installed on my phone. I would like to debug this release apk (by means of Eclipse) whilst it is running on my phone. I have done this before (and remember it being with one of the Android development tools; perhaps Dalvik Debug Monitor) but unfortunately cannot remember how to do it and have been unable to find any articles online. Does anyone know how this can be done?


  Note: I have set android:debuggable="true" in the manifest and have enabled USB Debugging on my phone.

A:Be sure that android:debuggable="true" is set in the application tag of your manifest file, and then:


Plug your phone into your computer and enable USB debugging on the phone
Open eclipse and a workspace containing the code for your app
In Eclipse, go to Window->Show View->Devices
Look at the Devices view which should now be visible, you should see your device listed
If your device isn't listed, you'll have to track down the ADB drivers for your phone before continuing
If you want to step through code, set a breakpoint somewhere in your app
Open the app on your phone
In the Devices view, expand the entry for your phone if it isn't already expanded, and look for your app's package name. 
Click on the package name, and in the top right of the Devices view you should see a green bug along with a number of other small buttons. Click the green bug.
You should now be attached/debugging your app.
