Q:I am trying to create a new folder inside the /res directory

I added a new directory



The folder does not appear in the /res folder even though it exists in the finder



Case and point I tried adding the folder again and I got a message telling me it exists.



If you can suggest what I can do to fix this I'd love it!

(And yes I have restarted the program as well as my computer)

A:Turns out there is a selector at the top which, by default, is set to show Android. If you flick the toggle down to 'Packages' you can see your own packages.
