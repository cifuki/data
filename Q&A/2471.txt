Q:I'm porting some C++ code to Android using NDK and GCC. The code basically runs. At one point, when debugging in Eclipse, the call

Dabbler::Android::Factory* pFactory = new Dabbler::Android::Factory;


causes this error:

Thread [1] (Suspended: Signal 'SIGILL' received. Description: Illegal instruction.) 
    1 <symbol is not available> 0x812feb44


What does that mean? Has the compiler generated illegal code for some reason? I have a breakpoint in the constructor (which does nothing), and it's not hit. I have already done a full rebuild.

What could I be doing wrong to cause this problem?

A:It works now. For anyone else struggling with Android/NDK/GCC/Eclipse, here's how I solved it:


Bury a dead cat at midnight when full moon
Restart the Android device emulator


Haven't verified if both steps are really necessary, and if not, which one is redundant.
