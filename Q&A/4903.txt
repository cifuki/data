Q:I know that it is impossible to set percentages and that you can set a weight of certain images to scale their heights. What I am trying to do though is specify the height of a layout relative to the layout it is within. Basicly I have something like this

<LinearLayout android:layout_height="fill_parent">
  <LinearLayout>

  </LinearLayout>
</LinearLayout>


Of course this is a very simplified version, just so you can understand my gibberish. Basicly I want to set the inner linearlayout to be around 50% of the main linearlayout.

What is the best way to do this?

A:You could add another empty layout below that one and set them both to have the same layout weight. They should get 50% of the space each.
