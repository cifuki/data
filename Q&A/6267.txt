Q:A question about the editor, I am not sure how to briefly phrase the question so I could not find an answer

I have just moved from Eclipse to Android Studio on the Mac.  

If in a layout file, I start typing android:au, assuming I want to choose autotext see screenshot


How can I get the completion to go upto the "to" of "auto". So that I just have to type the T and then enter to choose autoText.

Since there are no options without the "to" I should be allowed to select it.

Please let me know if my explanation is not clear enough

A:Intellij (Studio) parses the whole text to search for your input characters by default. If you type "Text", it should show "autoText" in the options by default. You don't have to configure anything for this behavior.

It will give preference to exact matches though, so if you type in "Text" with a capital T, you're more likely to get the correct result than typing "text" with a small t.

You can change these preferences in:

Settings(or Preferences in mac)->Editor->Code Completion
