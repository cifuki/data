A:You should make this change in the config.xml found at the root of your project.  For example you might have something like this:

<widget id="com.ionicframework.exampleproject223738" version="0.0.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets" xmlns:cdv="http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0">


Change the id to whatever you wish your package to be and it will work for the entire project, Android and iOS.

However, if you've already submitted to the app store with a package name, you cannot change the package name at this point.  Not unless you want to submit a new project.  Updates must be made with matching package names.
