Q:I am developing an app that supports Android >= 4.0. It uses fragments from the android.app package. As I am facing problems with the older fragment implementation in 4.0, like this one, that are already fixed in the support library, I am considering switching back to the fragment implementation from the support library to get a more reliable and consistent implementation.

What is your opinion on this? Are you using fragments from the support library, even though they are already available, when developing for Android 4?

A:From my experience, using the same fragment implementation on all Android devices is a great advantage. I could not get rid of all NullPointerExceptions when state is saved on Android 4.0 using native fragments, with the support library they are all gone. Also I could not see any disadvantage so far with this approach.

So my answer to my own question is now: When developing for Android 4.x, using the fragments from the support library is a good idea. The support library has bugs fixed that are still present in older fragment implementations and is frequently updated with more bug fixes.
