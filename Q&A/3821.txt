Q:Periodically LogCat will stop showing messages even though I am in debug mode.  At other times it will display only one line at a time!  I have a solution, restart eclipse. But I would like to understand this better.  It takes too much time to restart eclipse when this happens.  I have seen this behavior on the emulator and connected to a device.  Either the LogCat shows one line with no history or nothing.

A:Yes, I can get the normal logcat back by clear the log. Also I uncheck the "Limit console output" in Run/Debug->Console.
