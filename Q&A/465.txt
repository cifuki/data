Q:When I use Toast to display some popup text on the screen, it displays the text a little bit above the bottom of the screen, which is the default position.

Now I want to display it in the middle of screen or somewhere according to my choice.

Can anyone guide me how to achieve this?

A:From the documentation,


  Positioning your Toast
  
  A standard toast notification appears near the bottom of the screen,
  centered horizontally. You can change this position with the
  setGravity(int, int, int) method. This accepts three parameters: a
  Gravity constant, an x-position offset, and a y-position offset.
  
  For example, if you decide that the toast should appear in the
  top-left corner, you can set the gravity like this:

toast.setGravity(Gravity.TOP|Gravity.LEFT, 0, 0);

  
  If you want to nudge the position to the right, increase the value of
  the second parameter. To nudge it down, increase the value of the last
  parameter.
