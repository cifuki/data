Q:I've created a layout with an image view and a web view. The web view is set to have a default visibility of gone. When the activity fires up it displays the image view first and when the web view has finished loading its url, it marks itself as visible and the imageview is marked as hidden.

When the imageview is shown, I would like it to rotate repeatedly just for a little added pizazz. 

I have never done animations before in Android and all the posts I found when I asked the internet were not helpful; thus, I have returned to SO for help. 

So if I start with this...

    final ImageView splash = (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.splash);


How do I create a repeated rotate animation and apply it to the ImageView?

Thanks again!

A:Use a RotateAnimation, setting the pivot point to the centre of your image.

RotateAnimation anim = new RotateAnimation(0f, 350f, 15f, 15f);
anim.setInterpolator(new LinearInterpolator());
anim.setRepeatCount(Animation.INFINITE);
anim.setDuration(700);

// Start animating the image
final ImageView splash = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.splash);
splash.startAnimation(anim);

// Later.. stop the animation
splash.setAnimation(null);
