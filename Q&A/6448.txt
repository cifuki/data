Q:I haven't used Eclipse since 1 week ago. Today I started it and I noticed that it loaded slowly. When it was started it prompted this:

I thougth that maybe Eclipse has updated something of Android so I updated to the newest ADT. Now I have the same error but I have an extra big error that I don't know if it's because the previous error. I have tried the new feature of look how an xml layer looks in many devices. I have tried with 2 layers and now the program doesn't compiles because it says: 


  Incorrect line ending: found carriage return (\\r) without corresponding newline (\
)


The error for one xml is in this line:

     android:layout_height="wrap_content">    


and the other one is in:

    android:orientation="horizontal">


wtf has happened? I didn't change anything nor saved it and 1 week ago all was fine.

A:I just got the same annoying problem.
What I did was copying the entire code into notepad.
Then from notepad, paste it back into the xml field.
I know, it sounds stupid, but it worked and I have no idea why -__-"
