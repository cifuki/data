Q:In an attempt to compile external jars, I have to use the terminal and do a clean. However, when I go into the root directory of my project and execute


  gradlew clean


I get the following message:


  -bash: gradlew: command not found


Here's a screenshot of my application folder's home directory. 

Let me know if you need anything else, I'm not sure why this is happening.

A:gradlew is not in your global path. To execute the 'clean' task (or any task for that matter) using the gradle wrapper (gradlew) in your project directory in your terminal, specify the current directory with the './':

./gradlew clean
