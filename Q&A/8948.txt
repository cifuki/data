Q:The documentation on this is extremely poor. I understand that ProGuard can be enabled by manually editing "default.properties" in the project's rot directory. And all the settings go into the "proguard.cfg" file in the same place, but I'd like to know which version of ProGuard is being used (I'm using Eclise Indigo). I would also like to be able to upgrade it to the latest versions whenever the are released. But I can't find any reference on how to do it.

A:The ProGuard jar is located inside the Android SDK: android-sdk/tools/proguard/lib/proguard.jar

You can print out its version number with

java -jar android-sdk/tools/proguard/lib/proguard.jar


(with the proper path). If necessary, you can replace the jar (actually, the entire proguard subdirectory) with the latest version from the download page at the official ProGuard site.
