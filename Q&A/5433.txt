How do I check to see how much MB or GB is left on the android device ? I am using JAVA and android SDK 2.0.1.

Is there any system service that would expose something like this ?

A:Try this code:    

StatFs stat = new StatFs(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath());

long bytesAvailable = (long)stat.getBlockSize() *(long)stat.getBlockCount();
long megAvailable   = bytesAvailable / 1048576;

System.out.println("Megs :"+megAvailable);


Update:

getBlockCount() - return size of SD card;

getAvailableBlocks() - return the number of blocks that are still accessible to normal programs (thanks Joe)
