Q:Every time I try to export an APK from Eclipse (tried Juno and Indigo) on Mac, eclipse crashes after a few seconds

This used to work fine on my current setup.

Running the app straight (debug mode) on my phone works fine.

The error from the console is:

Invalid memory access of location 0x10073f113 rip=0x101f656f7
Bus error: 10


I'm using Mac OS X 10.7.4 on a ~2010 MacBook Pro, with the following java:

java version "1.6.0_33"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_33-b03-424-11M3720)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.8-b03-424, mixed mode)


I'm using ADT 20.

I've tried reinstalling Eclipse and the Android SDK, and re-downloading ADT.

The Eclipse error view doesn't show anything

Any ideas of different methods I can try, or other ways to investigate what's going wrong?

Cheers

Update: For anyone coming along post-2014, you should be using Android Studio, which doesn't have this problem.

A:Disable Project/Build Automatically when you are exporting

I think is a problem of Eclipse unable to detect the Android command is still working or something similar.

Of course there is ever the option of APK generation using Ant outside Eclipse you can generate an Ant build.xml from your Eclipse project more info in official Android docs
