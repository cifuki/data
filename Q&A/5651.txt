Q:How can I get the URL of the raw folder? I do not want to access my asset via id but by path instead.

A:Uri video = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.cpt.sample/raw/filename");


Using this you can access the file in raw folder, if you want to access the file in asset folder use this URL...

file:///android_asset/filename
