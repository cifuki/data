Q:I have added uses-permission including WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\xef\xbc\x8cMOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS\xef\xbc\x8cREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to AndroidManifest.xml.

When I tried to run my application in Nexus5 (Android 6.0),it threw a exception as below:

java.io.IOException: open failed: EACCES (Permission denied)

And I tried another Android phone(Android 5.1),everything was OK.Here's the code:

private File createImageFile() throws IOException {
    String timeStamp = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd_HHmmss").format(new Date());
    String imageFileName = "JPEG_" + timeStamp + "_";
    File storageDir = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);
    File image = File.createTempFile(imageFileName, ".jpg", storageDir);
    currentPhotoPath = image.getAbsolutePath();
    return image;
}


Does Android 6.0 have difference about permission?

A:Android added new permission model for Android 6.0 (Marshmallow).

So you have to check Runtime Permission :

What Are Runtime Permissions?

With Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Google introduced a new permission model that allows users to better understand why an application may be requesting specific permissions. Rather than the user blindly accepting all permissions at install time, the user is now prompted to accept permissions as they become necessary during application use.  

When to Implement the New Model?

it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require full support until you choose to target version 23 in your application. If you are targeting version 22 or below, your application will request all permissions at install time just as it would on any device running an OS below Marshmallow.
