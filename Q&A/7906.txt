Q:I have used Sharing-type intents before, such as:

Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
intent.setType("plain/text");
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, new String[] { "---" });
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "---");
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent, "Contact Us!"));


However, this basically shares with Email/MMS and other text or document type apps.  How do you do this same things but include Social sharing like Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus (to name the important ones).  And WHAT I want to share is the app, where the text says, "hey download this link to check out the app!" (or something similar along those lines).

A:To add the Facebook, Twitter etc. share options, the user just needs to have those applications installed. It's up to other applications what type of Intents they will tell the system they can handle.

Then a basic ACTION_SEND intent will get picked up.

Intent sendIntent = new Intent();
sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT,
    "Hey check out my app at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus");
sendIntent.setType("text/plain");
startActivity(sendIntent);
