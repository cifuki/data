Q:I want to create a toolbar in my app, and I am wondering what is the standard height for the toolbar in android?  

I want it to be big enough for a finger, but not huge. Is there a standard size?

A:Its best to use ?attr/actionBarSize as @Jaison Brooks commented.

In the material guidelines, suggested height is 56dp:


  Toolbar: 56dp
