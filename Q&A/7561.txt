Q:Keeping the screen awake can be accomplished by using a wakelock by

mWakeLock = mPowerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK, 
                getClass().getName());


Or by adding the FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON to the window,

getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);


What is the technical difference between the two and in terms of performance and battery life which is recommended?

A:A wakelock gives you way more control (Like waking the phone to download something without turning the screen off) and requires your application to hold the wakelock permission.

Therefore FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON is recommended if all you want is to keep the screen on while your window is visible.
