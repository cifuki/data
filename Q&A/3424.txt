Q:I want to test how my application effects the battery of a phone/tablet. 

Are there any testing tools which will allow me to do so?

For example, I want to test which modules of my application are consuming the most amount of battery, etc.

A:In practice, I believe most apps that have power problems, also have 'CPU' problems.  That is, a profile of your application's CPU usage is probably a good approximation of your battery consumption.  There are caveats and exceptions if, for example, your app is doing something expensive with the GPU, the wireless network, storage, etc, and that expensive operation isn't taking much CPU time.

Here's an interesting blog about a "Power Tutor" app that provides a more precise measurement on a running system than the built-in battery app:
http://gigaom.com/mobile/android-power-consumption-app/.  I haven't tried it.

For another level of detail, here is a paper that breaks down which components of a phone suck the most juice (note the paper is from 2010): http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix10/tech/full_papers/Carroll.pdf
(Just skip to section 5 to read their results). They say the screen brightness is the biggest culprit.

If the screen brightness is the biggest culprit, be sure to set that to a fixed level if you are measuring your own application's usage.

If you're really interested in measuring power consumption, you can follow their methodology (which invovles opening the phone and physically attaching measuring devices.)
