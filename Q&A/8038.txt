Q:I have a text file i want to include in my Android application, it is not a string file it is a standard text file. It contains data that defines the characteristics of a "map" that is drawn on a board. The file is not an XML file so i am unsure where i should put it or if this isn't good file structure for android? Are you suppose to do this? If you are then under what directory are you suppose to put them? How then are you suppose to access the file? I know how to use FileInputStreams and FileOutputStreams i just need to know how to access the file. All relevant answers are welcome and appreciated!
