Q:I am getting the following warning when compiling my cocos2d-x project with cygwin.

`/cygdrive/e/project/MyGame/proj.android `
/cygdrive/e/android-ndk-r8e/build/core/add-application.mk:128: Android NDK: WARNING:APP_PLATFORM android-9 is larger than android:minSdkVersion 8 in ./AndroidManifest.xml


I am using NDK version r8e. My minimum SDK version is 8 in my AndroidManifest.xml but i do not specify APP_PLATFORM as android-9 anywhere. How can i change this to 8.

Can anyone tell me how to solve this warning as I think this may cause issues.

A:It seems that you are using Android-9 as runtime. You can put APP_PLATFORM := android-8 in your Application.mk file and the warning will disappear.
