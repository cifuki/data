Q:I just update Android Studio, and when I restarted it, the preview window rendering failed, and I was told that 


  The following classes could not be found:
  -\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.internal.widget.ActionBarOverlayLayout


If someone can tell me what can I do to fix this rendering problem? Thank you.

A:You have to do two things:


be sure to have imported right appcompat-v7 library in your project structure -> dependencies
change the theme in the preview window to not an AppCompat theme. Try with Holo.light or Holo.dark for example.
