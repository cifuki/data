Q:I use the Google Maps Api Version 2 for Androidto add a MapFragment to my Application. 

This Fragments improves a lot in terms of speed and API usability. Sadly it also allows to rotate the map with a two finger gesture. I want to disable the rotation because this two finger gesture is often recognized instead of the gesture for zooming. 

How can I disable the map rotation?

A:It turned out to be straight forward if you look into the right place in documentation. 

There is a UiSettings class inside a GoogleMap that allows enabling and disabling of gestures. 

  SupportMapFragment mapFragment = (SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.maps_fragment);
  GoogleMap map = mapFragment.getMap();
  map.getUiSettings().setRotateGesturesEnabled(false);
