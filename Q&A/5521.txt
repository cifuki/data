Q:I've had frequent "Critical Structure Corruption" BSODs ever since installing Windows 8.1. I even bought a new computer thinking it was just Windows 8.1 being more sensitive to a potential hardware fault.

But the BSODs kept coming in thick and fast while doing pretty much nothing at all, not even running an emulator.

I had a kernel problem panic on my mac with the recent Mavericks and it led me to put two and two together and it seems that simply having Intel HAXM installed on Win8.1 was causing BSODs.

Uninstalling Intel HAXM stops the BSODs.

Ultimately, this question I'm guessing would be resolved when Intel or MS make an update that fixes the BSODs.
