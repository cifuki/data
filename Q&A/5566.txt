Q:I am using Google's SlidingTabLayout. As i only have 3 tabs to be displayed, I am seeing empty space after last tab. 
Please screenshot below.


Can someone explain me how to fit the tabs to entire screen. Thanks for your time.

A:In SlidingTabLayout.java, find 

protected TextView createDefaultTabView(Context context)


and add these lines to that method:

WindowManager wm = (WindowManager) context.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE);
Display display = wm.getDefaultDisplay();
Point size = new Point();
display.getSize(size);
textView.setWidth(size.x / 3);


That fixed it for me. Basically, you're getting the width of your screen and dividing by 3 (the number of tabs) and setting that as the width for the TextField that makes up your tab.

UPDATE:

In the current source, google added a setDistributeEvenly(Boolean); method, so you can use slidingTabs.setDistributeEvenly(true); instead. When using the older source code, either use my solution above, or update to the newest source (latter is recommended).
