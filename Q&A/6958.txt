Q:When I try to launch Android emulator, it crashes on Mac OS X. It was working some time ago, but now it isn't and I don't have an idea why.

Crash log: http://pastebin.com/04MjCqaS

Terminal log in verbose mode: http://pastebin.com/L6y6rUr0

A:Same issue here, I'm running a mac mini with 8GB of RAM and MacOS Lion. It used to work with the old AVD with some random crashes every now and then but since the last update to APi 17 it's a pain in the neck.

The ADT bundle doesn't work at all. After tweaking the memory limits on eclipse.ini file it throws random memory errors. Also it's not been able to download and install the m2e (maven to eclipse) plugin.

I moved to IntelliJ and I'm able to launch AVD manager but none of the "old" created devices work. If I create a new one and I launch it it works until I close it, then I have to restart the Mac and create a new device. Also it randomly shows errors when I want to delete those old created virtual devices.

Also the DDMS fails to start. I launch it, shows its icon on the Dock but it doesn't respond until I force close.
What a Nightmare. 

** EDIT **
I found at android dev bug tracker this issue when you're running 2 screens: here

This is happening to me with the android emulator. I solved it like this:
    cd ~/.android/avd
    ls *.avd 

Now choose the emulator that is crashing and

cd name_of_the_emulator.avd
touch emulator-user.ini
vi emulator-user.ini


And now reset window.x, that's window.x=0
exit and run the emulator.

If you move and close the emulator to the secondary screen it will crash the next time you want to run it.
