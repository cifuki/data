Q:In my Kotlin project I have some parts of Java code which I want to convert to Kotlin. The menu item Convert Java file to Kotlin is disabled because it's not a whole file I want to convert. 

How can I convert Java code to Kotlin?

A:There is no tool to convert Kotlin code to Java. If you want to convert part of a file from Java to Kotlin, the easiest way is to copy the code from the Java file in the IDE and paste it into the Kotlin file.
