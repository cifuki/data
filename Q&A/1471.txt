Q:I have few questions around using Volley in my projects:


Can this library be used in any Java project or just Android?
I see multiple branches here and no documentation on which branch is to start with. Which branch should I use to start with?
How do you integrate this library in your own project? What approach is better: Make Volley as a standalone library project and spin a jar and put it in your project or copy the all source code inside your project?

A:$ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley
$ cd volley
$ android update project -p .
$ ant jar


Then, copy bin/volley.jar into your libs/ folder and off you go!
