Q:The project I tried to run is set to minSDK level 7. I have gotten the above error message when running Android virtual device-5554(the other devices work well). It is working so slowly, and taking too much time to get home screen not even run. At the end, it gives this error :


  Failed to install *.apk on device 'emulator-5554': EOF


I restarted my computer and Eclipse several times, as well as clean projects. I also tried this Why is the Android emulator so slow? How can we speed up the Android emulator? to get it fixed. Yesterday, it was working pretty well. Now it is so sluggish. 

Any suggestion or help?  Thank you

A:I've ran into this problem many times. Try each of these steps after each step run the APK file if it doesn't work move to the next step:


Run it again. (simply try rerunning it).
Project->Clean (clean the project plus any projects that it relies on).
Right click project in the package explorer then close it. Then close Eclipse. Then reopen both.
Same as the previous step plus Project->Clean.
Restart the AVD.
Delete the AVD. Then go into the folder that holds the AVD in the Android-Sdk folder and delete anything with the AVD's name (a file plus a folder). You may have to restart your computer to get it to delete. Create a new AVD.
