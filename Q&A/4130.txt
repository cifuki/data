Q:I tried the following command and it worked fine on a couple of devices.

adb shell getprop | grep abi


This command fails to get the ARM processor version for some devices. Is there any other way to find out what version of ARM processor is my device running on?

Thanks

A:Try

adb shell cat /proc/cpuinfo
