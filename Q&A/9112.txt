Q:I am trying to set up Travis for Android. Running the build seems to work so far, but when it comes to the tests, it complains about "No connected devices!"

:app:connectedAndroidTestDebug FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:connectedAndroidTestDebug'.
> com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: java.lang.RuntimeException: 
    No connected devices!


Here is my .travis.yml, and from what I understand, I am creating and starting an emulator for the tests, just the way as the documentation says.

language: android
android:
  components:
    # Uncomment the lines below if you want to
    # use the latest revision of Android SDK Tools
    # - platform-tools
    # - tools

    # The BuildTools version used by your project
    - build-tools-22.0.1

    # The SDK version used to compile your project
    - android-22

    # Additional components
    - extra-google-google_play_services
    - extra-google-m2repository
    - extra-android-m2repository
    # - addon-google_apis-google-19
    # - add-on
    # - extra

    # Specify at least one system image,
    # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests
    - sys-img-armeabi-v7a-android-22
    # - sys-img-x86-android-17

  licenses:
    - 'android-sdk-license-.+'

  # Emulator Management: Create, Start and Wait
  before_script:
    - echo no | android create avd --force -n test -t android-22 --abi armeabi-v7a
    - emulator -avd test -no-skin -no-audio -no-window &
    - android-wait-for-emulator
    - adb shell input keyevent 82 &


Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it?

A:Unfortunately i am not allowed to comment, as i just want to complete DominicJodoin's answer. Correct indentation and a longer ADB_INSTALL_TIMEOUT is necessary as DominicJodoin already stated.

In my opinion your Emulator is running but not ready to install an apk. With - adb wait-for-device you wait until the device connected. According to the Documentation this means: 


  Note that this command does not cause adb to wait until the entire system is fully booted. For that reason, you should not prepend it to other commands that require a fully booted system. 


Try replacing this line with - android-wait-for-emulator in your travis.yml instead.
