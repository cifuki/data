A:Check out Paint.setStrokeWidth().

You draw by making various Drawable objects. The objects themselves are separated from the instructions about how to draw them; that's covered by the Paint class. Paint instances have a method that allows you set the width of the stroke that will be used to draw the objects, setStrokeWidth(), which is what you want.
