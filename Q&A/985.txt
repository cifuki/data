Q:I want to read strings from an xml file before I do much of anything else like setText on widgets, so how can I do that without an activity object to call getResources() on?

A:Create a subclass of Application, for instance public class App extends Application {
Set the android:name attribute of your <application> tag in the AndroidManifest.xml to point to your new class, e.g. android:name=".App"
In the onCreate() method of your app instance, save your context (e.g. this) to a static field named mContext and create a static method that returns this field, e.g. getContext():


This is how it should look:

public class App extends Application{

    private static Context mContext;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        mContext = this;
    }

    public static Context getContext(){
        return mContext;
    }
}


Now you can use: App.getContext() whenever you want to get a context, and then getResources() (or App.getContext().getResources()).
