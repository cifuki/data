Q:I am trying to set the android Theme.Light theme for my alert dialog, but with no success so far. After reading a few tutorials I gathered that using AlertDialog.Builder we cannot set the theme directly in the constructor (atleast in API level 7).

The alternate solution that I found is using a ContextThemeWrapper, which everyone assured would solve my problem. So I coded something like this:

AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(
                    new ContextThemeWrapper(context, R.style.popup_theme));


I described my theme in the values folder:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
<color name="back_color">#ffffffff</color>
<style name="popup_theme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Light">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@color/back_color</item>
    <item name="android:colorBackground">@color/back_color</item>
</style>




Unfortunately I still get the default Theme.Dialog.Alert theme. Can anyone tell me why? Where am I going wrong?

EDIT: 
If you do not know the answer to my question, please vote up. I have a bad habit of posting questions which get stuck :(

A:change parent="android:Theme.Light" to parent="@android:style/Theme.Light"
