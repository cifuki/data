Q:I have a System app that uses system permissions and I have those permissions listed in the manifest. Eclipse gives the following error when I try to make a build(command line build works):


  Permission is only granted to system apps


I'm already aware that my app requires system permissions and it is not a problem for me because my application will be used only on rooted phones. So I want to suppress this error, anyone knows how?

EDIT
My project already compiles fine on command line, installs, runs etc.. My problem is about eclipse giving an error for a legit manifest file.

A:In Eclipse: 


  Window -> Preferences -> Android -> Lint Error Checking.


In the list find an entry with ID = ProtectedPermission. Set the Severity to something lower than Error. This way you can still compile the project using Eclipse.

In Android Studio:


  File -> Settings -> Editor -> Inspections


Under Android Lint, locate Using system app permission. Either uncheck the checkbox or choose a Severity lower than Error.
