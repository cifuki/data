A:It depends by the exec-permission to your unix gradlew script.

It can be fixed using the command: 

git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew


A little desciption to understand the problem.
First of all you can check your permissions using:

git ls-tree HEAD


You will see:

100644 blob xxxxxxxxxxx gradlew


As you can see the file has 644 permission.   

Fix it by setting the executable flag on your gradlew file changing it to 755:

git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew


Just commit and push the changes:

git commit -m "permission access for travis"

[master e80ab1b] gradlew permission access for travis
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 mode change 100644 => 100755 gradlew


A last check running git ls-tree again to see the change:

git ls-tree HEAD


You can see:

100755 blob xxxxxxxxxxxxx   gradlew




Another way to solve this issue is to use:

before_install:
 - chmod +x gradlew


This kind of solution doesn't change the permission in your git repo, but just changes the permission runtime in the execution.
