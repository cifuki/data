Q:I need to install just ADB on customer\xc2\xb4s PC to connect to android phone and install apk there. And because of SDK size is it possible to do it without installing whole SDK?

A:Yes you can

Installing ADB in windows without Download Android SDK


  
  Firstly, you'll need a program that can partially download contents of
  zip files from the internet. 
  Once that's set up, go to the SDK
  download page and grab the link to the SDK. 
  In the zip file, navigate
  to "android-sdk-windows\\tools" 
  From there, select only "adb.exe",
  "AdbWinApi.dll" and "AdbWinUsbApi.dll" 
  Download.
