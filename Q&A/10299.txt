A:SDK Tools is a downloadable component for the Android SDK. It includes the complete set of development and debugging tools for the Android SDK like emulator, sdcard, sqlite and apk builder etc.. 
Where as Platform-tools are used to support the features for the current android platform including adb which is acting like a bridge to communicate with emulator or device.
