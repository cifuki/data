Q:My Android application may save logcat logs to a file. This log file is then sent to developers for analysis.

Is there a nice desktop android log viewer application, which would visualize these logs?

I wasn't able to find a ready to use tool in Android SDK. Maybe I missed something there?

A:Desktop tool for reading android logcat log file, the same as DDMS.

The purpose of this tool is to allow developers to quickly locate, analyze, problem-solving, rather 
than struggling in the log file.
