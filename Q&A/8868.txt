Q:What would be a sensible way to add DISTINCT and/or GROUPBY to ContentResolver- based queries. Right now I have to create custom URI for each special case. Is there a better way?
(I still program for 1.5 as lowest common denominator)

A:You can do nice hack when querying contentResolver, use: 

String selection = Models.SOMETHING + "=" + something + ") GROUP BY (" + Models.TYPE;
