Q:I installed the ADT bundle from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html yesterday, and I was following a basic Hello World tutorial. I created a new Android Application Project with a Blank Activity named MainActivity. The resulting project has an empty src folder and empty res\\layout folder. There is a R.java file in the gen folder but it has no reference to MainActivity. This is what the SDK manager says I have installed


Android SDK Tools v 22.6
Android SDK Platform-tools v 19.0.1
Android SDK Build-tools v 19
SDK Platform v 3
ARM EABI v7a System Image v 2
Android Support Library v 19.0.1
Google USB Driver v 9


I also tried manually creating an activity by right clicking the src folder and going to Android Activity, but when I hit Finish on the creation wizard, nothing happens. Does anyone have any clues as to what's going on? Did I miss a key component to install or something?

A:If you updated to Android SDK Tools version 22.6, you are required to Update DDMS Tools and Plugins.

Go to "Help Menu Bar" -> "Install New software" and install (this will update it)

Also update "Developer Tools" and "NDK Plugins" to latest Version.
This steps is useful for me and worked also.
