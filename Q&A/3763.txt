Q:I have a VideoView that takes up the top half of the Activity in portrait orientation with the bottom half of the screen showing some images and text.  I am playing a rtsp video stream in the video view when the Activity starts.  I have attached a MediaController to the VideoView via the following code:

    MediaController controller = new MediaController(this);
    controller.setAnchorView(this.videoView);
    controller.setMediaPlayer(this.videoView);
    this.videoView.setMediaController(controller);


When I tap the VideoView to bring up the MediaController on the screen I expected the playback controls to appear overlaying the bottom area of the VideoView (the bottom of the MediaController even with the bottom of the VideoView).  Instead the MediaController pops up lower down on the screen, overlaying some of the graphics and text I have below the VideoView.  

Are there some additional steps I need to take to get the MediaController to appear where I want it to on the screen?

A:Frankly, I'd just write my own controller. In fact, I did once.

That being said, try setAnchorView() -- by my reading of the source code, the MediaController will appear at the bottom of whatever the anchor view is.
