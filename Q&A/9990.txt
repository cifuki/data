Q:I try to use the GradientDrawable to set a gradient to some backgrounds and buttons. 
Sadly the documentation is not very detailed. 

What are the main attributes to configure the gradient? I understand start and endcolor but some of the other attributes could need some explanation.

At the moment I used images as the background for the buttons but a drawable defined in XML would be much nicer. 

I try to get a look like this (It is a very light gradient): alt text http://janusz.de/~janusz/RedButton.png

A:use this xml as background to the imageview.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
<gradient android:angle="90" android:startColor="#7c0000" android:endColor="#A71C1C"/>
</shape>


thats it.
