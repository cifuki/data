Q:I have a TextView in a layout whos background is a Selector. And the TextView's text is set to Spanned from HTML.
Then I set the TextView with the LinkMovementMethod.

Now when I tap on the TextView, the click event is not sent to its parent layout to trigger the selector.

How should this be solved?

A:I think you need to use one of those methods in order to be able to intercept the event before it gets sent to the appropriate components:

Activity.dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows your Activity to intercept all touch events before they are dispatched to the window.

ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows a ViewGroup to watch events as they are dispatched to child Views.

ViewParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(boolean) - Call this upon a parent View to indicate that it should not intercept touch events with onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent).

More information here.

Hope that helps.
