Q:When I wanted to get Android source code, I knew that I have to use "repo". So what is repo? Why do they use repo and not just use GIT?, and is there a GUI for repo that enables me to pause/resume syncing, because every time I get disconnected occasionally it seems that repo starts syncing from the beginning!

A:Repo and git - what they are, what they are for - is explained on source.android.com


  To work with the Android code, you
  will need to use both Git and Repo.
  
  Git is an open-source version-control system designed to
  handle very large projects that are
  distributed over multiple
  repositories. In the context of
  Android, we use Git for local
  operations such as local branching,
  commits, diffs, and edits.
  
  Repo is a tool that we built on top of Git. Repo helps us manage the
  many Git repositories, does the
  uploads to our revision control
  system, and automates parts of the
  Android development workflow. Repo is
  not meant to replace Git, only to make
  it easier to work with Git in the
  context of Android. The repo command
  is an executable Python script that
  you can put anywhere in your path.


There's no GUI for Repo, as far as I can tell, but there's quite a bit of guidance on the site above for controlling what Repo is doing from the command line.
