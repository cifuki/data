Q:Is there any way to unpublish and then permanently remove an application from the list of applications on Android Developer Console?

A:No, you can unpublish but once your application has been live on the market you cannot delete it. (Each package name is unique and Google remembers all package names anyway so you could use this a reminder)

The "Delete" button only works for unpublished version of your app. Once you published your app or a particular version of it, you cannot delete it from the Market. However, you can still "unpublish" it. The "Delete" button is only handy when you uploaded a new version, then you realized you goofed and want to remove that new version before publishing it.

A reference



Update, you can now filter out unpublished or draft apps from your listing.



Unpublish option can be found in the header area, beside PUBLISHED text.
