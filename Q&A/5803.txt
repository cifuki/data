Q:Currently I'm trying to learn Gradle to build Android APKs. How to set an option in gradle to build an unsigned APK?

A:You don't have to set any option, just run the usual task:

$ gradle assemble


This will generate two files in project/build/apk/

app-debug-unaligned.apk 
app-release-unsigned.apk
