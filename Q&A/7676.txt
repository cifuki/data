Q:I have an Activity A, and there is a button B in the view. If somebody presses B then I want a pop-up which can take some part of screen making the A invisible in that area but rest of A is visible but not active. How can I achieve this?

A:If you want to do this using an Activity instead of a Dialog, you can do this by setting the activity's theme to android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog" in the manifest - this will make the activity appear like a dialog (floating on top of whatever was underneath it).
