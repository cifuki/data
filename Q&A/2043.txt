Q:I am creating event search application, we set search criteria from one screen populate in another screen then user can edit search criteria from 3rd screen and goes to 4th screen.

To achieve above task i am using static object which remember the values around the application and i don't need to do any thing extra.

But i am afraid if about static object life cycle in android if low memory found android delete static objects ???

As android supports multi tasking, if user switches to another application and when user comes back application start acting crazy, does static object get removed when it multi task ??? any idea ?? and also suggest holding static object via singleton method is better approach ???

A:Lets start with a bit of background: What happens when you start an application?
    The OS starts a process and assigns it a unique process id and allocates a process table.A process start an instance of DVM(Dalvik VM); Each application runs inside a DVM.
A DVM manages class loading unloading, instance lifecycle, GC etc.

Lifetime of a static variable: A static variable comes into existence when a class is loaded by the JVM and dies when the class is unloaded.

So if you create an android application and initialize a static variable, it will remain in the JVM until one of the following happens:
1. the class is unloaded
2. the JVM shuts down
3. the process dies  

Note that the value of the static variable will persist when you switch to a different activity of another application and none of the above three happens. Should any of the above three happen the static will lose its value.

You can test this with a few lines of code:


print the uninitialized static in onCreate of your activity -> should print null
initialize the static. print it -> value would be non null
Hit the back button and go to home screen. Note: Home screen is another activity.
Launch your activity again -> the static variable will be non-null
Kill your application process from DDMS(stop button in the devices window).
Restart your activity -> the static will have null value.


Hope that helps.
