Q:Say I want to make my own event listener for my class, how do I do that? Do I need to maintain a thread manually?

OnCustomEventListener mListener;

Create an interface that will be implemented by your activity:

public interface OnCustomEventListener {
    void onEvent();
}

public void setCustomEventListener(OnCustomEventListener eventListener) {
    mListener = eventListener;
}


Now you need to know when the event is actually occurring.  For example when the user touches a point on screen, override onTouchEvent method:

onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
    if (ev.getAction==MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
        if(mListener!=null) 
            mListener.onEvent();
    }
}


Similarly, you can create a specific event that you want. (examples could be touch down, wait for exactly 2 seconds and release- you would need to do some logic inside touch event).

In your activity, you can use the customView object to set an eventListener as such:

 customView.setCustomEventListener(new OnCustomEventListener() {
    public void onEvent() {
        //do whatever you want to do when the event is performed.
    }
 });
