Q:I'm using push notifications on google cloud, however for some reason i cant receive push notifications on the emulator. 

The same application does receive notifications when i test it on a real device however.

Has anyone else encountered this or found solutions to it? the emulated device has net access and is the same android version as the real one so i cant think of any reason it shouldn't work.

A:Which target have your emulator? For Google Services like GCM, use a "Google APIs" (any version) target to receive push notifications
