Q:Has anyone tried using ExoPlayer to achieve this? 
I tried looking online with no success. 

When I say gapless playback, I am referring to the problem of using the media player to play local videos back to back. After the first video is done playing, there is a noticeable delay of 1 second before the second video starts. 

Hoping this question helps in understanding this issue further. 
For reference please look at the following question:

Android: MediaPlayer gapless or seamless Video Playing

A:ExoPlayer 2, which is now officially released, seems to support gapless playback using the ConcatenatingMediaSource class. From its developer guide:


  Transitions between sources are seamless. There is no requirement that the sources being concatenated are of the same format (e.g. it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to concatenate a video file containing 480p H264 with one that contains 720p VP9). The sources may even be of different types (e.g. it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to concatenate a video with an audio only stream).


And the example code:

MediaSource firstSource = new ExtractorMediaSource(firstVideoUri, ...);
MediaSource secondSource = new ExtractorMediaSource(secondVideoUri, ...);
// Plays the first video, then the second video.
ConcatenatingMediaSource concatenatedSource =
    new ConcatenatingMediaSource(firstSource, secondSource);
