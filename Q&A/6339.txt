Q:I have a problem on my Android project, I can't build, this is the error I have:


  Failed to notify dependency resolution listener.
  The library com.google.android.gms:play-services-measurement-base is being requested by various other libraries at [[15.0.2,15.0.2], [15.0.4,15.0.4]], but resolves to 15.0.4. Disable the plugin and check your dependencies tree using ./gradlew :app:dependencies.


I tried many different solution I found but the problem persists. 
I have the right dependencies and repositories on gradle file on project root:

dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.2'
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1'
}


and

repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url "https://maven.google.com"
    }
}


On my app gradle I have the following dependencies:

implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:15.0.1"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-places:15.0.1"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:15.0.1"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:15.0.1"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:15.0.2"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:15.0.1"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-tagmanager:15.0.2"
implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-core:16.0.0"


Some suggestions?

The solution was update the following dependencies:

implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:16.0.0"
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-tagmanager:16.0.0"

A:I had the same exact error, upgrading analytics was the key:

implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:16.0.0'

I know you thought everything is updated referring to the official website, but writing 15.0.0 and looking for suggestions works better.
