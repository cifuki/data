Q:When I start Android Studio there's a message


  Can't start Git: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd\\git.cmd Probably the
  path to Git executable is not valid. Fix it.


But I can see that the git.cmd IS there. How do I fix the issue then?

A:Check that C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd is in you Path environment variable:

echo $env:Path
