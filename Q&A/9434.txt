A:Ok, I think that I find sollution from great xda developers: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1776095 here is full description how to obtain access to apps signed by platform keys.
Do you apply with this approach?
PS it is interesting that users from stack instead of investigating hard problem immediately say that you can not solve it, then reduce novice user's reputation...
