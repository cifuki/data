Q:Does anybody know how to add multiline snippet to Google Maps marker? That's my code for adding markers:

map.getMap().addMarker(new MarkerOptions()
    .position(latLng()).snippet(snippetText)
    .title(header).icon(icon));


I want snippet to look like this:

| HEADER |
|foo     |
|bar     |


but when I'm trying to set snippetText to "foo \
 bar", I see just foo bar and I don't have any ideas how to make it multiline. Can you help me?

A:It looks like you will need to create your own "info window" contents to make that work:


Create an implementation of InfoWindowAdapter that overrides getInfoContents() to return what you want to go into the InfoWindow frame
Call setInfoWindowAdapter() on your GoogleMap, passing an instance of your InfoWindowAdapter


This sample project demonstrates the technique. Replacing my snippets with "foo\
bar" correctly processes the newline. However, more likely, you will just come up with a layout that avoids the need for the newline, with separate TextView widgets for each line in your desired visual results.
