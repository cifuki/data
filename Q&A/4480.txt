Q:I don't know how I can describe this issue. I searched a lot, but I didn't find any solution.

Also this solution did not help me -keepattributes EnclosingMethod:

dependencies {
    compile project(':libraries:material-drawer')
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.2.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.2.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:design:23.2.0'
    compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.4'
    compile 'com.mcxiaoke.volley:library:1.0.19'
    compile 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2'
    compile 'com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.4.0'
    compile 'de.greenrobot:eventbus:2.4.0'
    compile 'com.commit451:PhotoView:1.2.4'
    compile 'com.nineoldandroids:library:2.4.0'
    compile 'com.viewpagerindicator:viewpagerindicator:2.4.3'
    compile('com.github.afollestad.material-dialogs:commons:0.8.5.6@aar') {
        transitive = true
    }
    compile('com.crashlytics.sdk.android:crashlytics:2.5.5@aar') {
        transitive = true;
    }
}


And the jar folder contains ormlite-android-4.48.jar and ormlite-core-4.48.jar.

Proguard File:

-keepattributes EnclosingMethod

A:Try adding

-keepattributes InnerClasses
-dontoptimize


to the ProGuard config. That should fix the problem.

It's probable that incompatible optimizations are applied (that probably causes the last line of the error log).

If you want to allow optimizations, it's necessary to fine tune optimizations config with 

-optimizations optimization_filter 


option in ProGuard config.
