Q:We're building an application which is using the google maps api for android.

I have my MapController and MapView, and I enable the built-in zoom controls using:

mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);


I would now like to get an event when the user actually zooms on the map, how do I go about that? I can find no such event or any general event where I could detect a change in zoom level.

Update

The mapView.getZoomControls() is deprecated. And the documentation suggests using mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(bool) instead. This is okay, but I simply cannot figure out how to act on events from the built in zoom controls.

A:With the Google Maps Android API v2 you can use a GoogleMap.OnCameraChangeListener like this:

mMap.setOnCameraChangeListener(new OnCameraChangeListener() {

    private float currentZoom = -1;

    @Override
    public void onCameraChange(CameraPosition pos) {
        if (pos.zoom != currentZoom){
            currentZoom = pos.zoom;
            // do you action here
        }
    }
});
