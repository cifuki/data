Q:After upgrading to Android Studio 3.1.2 I am getting the following error:


  Configuration on demand is not supported by the current version of the Android Gradle plugin since you are using Gradle version 4.6 or above. Suggestion: disable configuration on demand by setting org.gradle.configureondemand=false in your gradle.properties file or use a Gradle version less than 4.6.


I attempted following the suggestion but this did not fix the issue. Any ideas? All help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

A:No need to downgrade!

Disabling configure on demand requires two steps:


Remove org.gradle.configureondemand from gradle.properties.
In Android Studio,
For Mac go to the Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler and uncheck the configure on demand.
For Linux/Windows go to the File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler and uncheck the configure on demand.


Note, there are 2 gradle.properties files


In your project gradle.properties
${HOME}/.gradle/gradle.properties
