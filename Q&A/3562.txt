Q:So my layout looks basically like this:

<ScrollView>
    <RelativeLayout>
        <BunchOfViews/>
        <ImageView android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"/>
    </RelativeLayout>
</ScrollView>


I have the ScrollView so all of the layout always is visible no matter the height of the screen. The problem is that on a very high screen, I still want my ImageView to be at the bottom. However, a child of a ScrollView don't seem to have a defined bottom. The View is placed at the top of the layout. How can I solve this problem in a neat way?

A:I ran into the same issue.  I never could find a very pleasing solution, but here is how I did it.  Maybe someone else has a better way, I hate adding layouts that don't do anything.

My hack was to add a dummy linearlayout at the bottom of the scrollview that has fill_parent to take up all the room and force the scrollview to fill the screen.  Then add whatever component I want to that linearlayout.

Here is one of my layouts that does this:

<ScrollView
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:fillViewport="true" >

    <RelativeLayout
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="fill_parent"
        android:layout_marginTop="15px" >

        <!-- bunch of components here -->

        <LinearLayout
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="fill_parent"
            android:layout_below="@+id/spinner"
            android:layout_marginTop="5px"
            android:gravity="center_horizontal|bottom"
            android:paddingTop="2px" >

            <Button
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:paddingLeft="20px"
                android:paddingRight="20px"
                android:text="Delete" />
        </LinearLayout>
    </RelativeLayout>
</ScrollView>
