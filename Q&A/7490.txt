Q:Is it possible to have an event when the FragmentTransaction is completed ?

FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
ft.replace(R.id.content_frame, fragment).commit();


In fact, I use a Drawer for my application and I would like to trigger invalidateOptionsMenu(); when the transaction is completed to change the menu of my action bar.

A:You don't need to wait for the fragment transaction to complete, You can call 

getSupportFragmentManager().executePendingTransactions();


after your commit() function call.

This will ensure that the transaction is complete.
