Q:How can I determine/calculate the byte size of a bitmap (after decoding with BitmapFactory)?
I need to know how much memory space it occupies, because I'm doing memory caching/management in my app. (file size is not enough, since these are jpg/png files)

Thanks for any solutions!

Update: getRowBytes * getHeight might do the trick.. I'll implement it this way until someone comes up with something against it.

A:getRowBytes() * getHeight() seems to be working fine to me.

Update to my ~2 year old answer:
Since API level 12 Bitmap has a direct way to query the byte size:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.html#getByteCount%28%29

----Sample code 

    @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR1)
    protected int sizeOf(Bitmap data) {
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR1) {
            return data.getRowBytes() * data.getHeight();
        } else {
            return data.getByteCount();
        }
    }
