Q:I'm looking for a way to find out if a specific application is installed from a client-side web browser. The platform is Android.

For example I write my own web site and I write my own application, now I want to when user comes to my own site from Android phone Browser. The Browser look if the application is already installed on the phone and if not suggest to install application. Can I do that ?

A:You mean from JavaScript running in the browser? I think (hope) that's impossible. I wouldn't want any random website to be able to see what apps are installed.

If you want the user to install a particular app, you can provide a Market link on your website: http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/publishing.html#marketintent
