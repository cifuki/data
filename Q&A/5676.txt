Q:For the emulator I have below, I am getting the error message that "Google Play Services not installed on the device".

As per the developer site, it says that 'The Android emulator with an AVD that runs the Google APIs platform based on Android 4.2.2 or higher.

Not able to understand if the emulator is running 4.4.2 then why is google play services not present?





Some related threads, but no resolution. (adding these just to point out this issue is not a duplicate):

A:http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html

Quoting docs


  If you want to test your app on the emulator, expand the directory for
  Android 4.2.2 (API 17) or a higher version, select Google APIs, and
  install it. Then create a new AVD with Google APIs as the platform
  target.


Needs Emulator of Google API"S

See the target in the snap

I prefer testing on a real device which has google play services installed
