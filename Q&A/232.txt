Q:How can you set the event listener for a Spinner when the selected item changes?

Basically what I am trying to do is something similar to this:

spinner1.onSelectionChange = handleSelectionChange;

void handleSelectionChange(Object sender){
    //handle event
}

A:Some of the previous answers are not correct. They work for other widgets and views, but the documentation for the Spinner widget clearly states: 


  A spinner does not support item click
  events. Calling this method will raise
  an exception.


Better use OnItemSelectedListener() instead:

spinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(new OnItemSelectedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> parentView, View selectedItemView, int position, long id) {
        // your code here
    }

    @Override
    public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView<?> parentView) {
        // your code here
    }

});


This works for me.

Note that onItemSelected method is also invoked when the view is being build, so you can consider putting it inside onCreate() method call.
