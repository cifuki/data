Q:In the Android > Sample app > Trivial Drive when running the app I get the following when doing an IAP:

Error - Authentication is required. You need to sign into your Google Account


I've switched to a separate account on my phone with the testing account (i.e. the testing email address I've specified in the Developer Console) and followed all the steps here:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20369/getting-authentication-is-required-when-trying-to-access-the-play-store

but no joy.

Any further suggestions?

==== UPDATE

I've since blasted away all Google Accounts on my phone and now have just 1 account - i.e. the Testing account.

And I've tried everything here: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20369/getting-authentication-is-required-when-trying-to-access-the-play-store

A:I believe that Google now requires that the app is published as alpha version and a Google group specifically for testing is set up. I wasn't able to find this information in the official documentation (which means that Google probably didn't update it in quite some time), but here: https://help.gamesalad.com/hc/en-us/articles/203536123-7-6-In-App-Purchases-IAP-for-Google-Play
