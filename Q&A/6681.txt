Q:As I am working with Google Maps API, I have been used to work with a custom debug key in Eclipse (that is in fact my production key)

This manipulation allowed me to use the same API key for Maps and most of Google Play Services (in app billing) in my debug and release build.

This was really convenient because there was no need to change the key in the manifest.



Unfortunately, with the migration to Android Studio, I am missing this feature.

Any idea where I can find this option back?

Thank a lot.

A:You define a keystore in your build.gradle file. See the Signing Configurations section here: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html

In your case, you want to redefine the keystore for the debug variant:

android {
    signingConfigs {
        debug {
            storeFile file("your.keystore")
        }
    }
}


However, you should really be using two different keystores for debug and release configurations.
