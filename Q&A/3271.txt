After installing the Android O preview on a test device my ADB stopped working and started giving me this error.

adb server version (36) doesn't match this client (39); killing...
adb E 03-27 08:01:55  2925 147690 usb_osx.cpp:333] Could not open interface: e00002c5
adb E 03-27 08:01:55  2925 147690 usb_osx.cpp:294] Could not find device interface
error: could not install *smartsocket* listener: Address already in use
ADB server didn't ACK
* failed to start daemon *
error: cannot connect to daemon 

The only answers I have come across on this issue referred to Genymotion being out of sync with ADB but I don\xe2\x80\x99t use Genymotion. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have already wiped and reinstalled Android Studio as well as all of its tools and settings yet seem to still have this issue.

A:In my case this error occured when I set up my environment adb path as ~/.android-sdk/platform-tools (which happens when e.g. android-platform-tools is installed via homebrew), which version was 36, but Android Studio project has Android SDK next path ~/Library/Android/sdk which adb version was 39.

I have changed my PATH to platform-tools to ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools and error was solved
