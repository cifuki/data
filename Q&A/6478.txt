Q:It seems the java.net.NetworkInterface implementation of android does not have a
byte[]  getHardwareAddress() method
http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/NetworkInterface.html

I've found several forums of people trying to do this with no definitive answer, I need to get a somewhat cross-device UUID, so I can't rely on phone numbers or in ANDROID_ID (which can be overwritten and which I think depends on the user having a google account)
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ANDROID_ID

In linux you can use ifconfig or read from /proc/net/arp and you can easily get the Hardware address.

Is there a file in android that I can read?

There has to be a way to get this address since it's shown in the "Settings > About Phone > Status" of the phone.

Which means, if nothing else, you can go putter around the Android open source code, perhaps using Google Code Search, to figure out where it pulls that from.

Doing a bit of puttering myself, it would appear it is using getMacAddress() from WifiInfo.
