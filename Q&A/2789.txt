Q:I have 2 build flavors, say, flavor1 and flavor2.

I would like my application to be named, say, "AppFlavor1" when I build for flavor1 and "AppFlavor2" when I build for flavor 2. 

It is not the title of activities I want to change. I want to change the app name as it's displayed on the phone menu and elsewhere.

From build.gradle I can set various parameters for my flavors but, it seems, not the app label. And I can not change the app label programmatically based on some variable, too.

So, how do people handle this?

A:Instead of changing your main strings.xml with a script and risk messing up your source control, why not rely on the standard merging behavior of the Android Gradle build?

My build.gradle contains

sourceSets {
    main {
        manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'
        java.srcDirs = ['src']
        resources.srcDirs = ['src']
        aidl.srcDirs = ['src']
        renderscript.srcDirs = ['src']
        res.srcDirs = ['res']
        assets.srcDirs = ['assets']
    }

    release {
        res.srcDir 'variants/release/res'
    }

    debug {
        res.srcDir 'variants/debug/res'
    }
}


So now I can define my app_name string in the variants/[release|debug]/res/strings.xml. And anything else I want to change, too!
