Q:I'm in trouble since yesterday. In my internship I faced the following build error, but I couldn't understand why :

$ cordova build android

[...]

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':transformClassesWithDexForDebug'.
> com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Lorg/apache/cordova/BuildHelper;

A:Most likely you are using the newly released cordova-android@6.3.0, which now includes BuildHelper.java (as noted in your error message) and PermissionHelper.java, but you still have the deprecated cordova-plugin-compat in your project which is causing the build to fail because it also contains these classes.

To fix this, remove cordova-plugin-compat from your project to uninstall these Java files from the cordova-android platform project::

cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-compat --force


Update

To persist this change add cordova-plugin-compat@1.2 which includes an engine constraint to prevent the Java files being re-installed into the cordova-android@6.3+ platform:

cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-compat@1.2


Another update (copypasted from comments)

After removing and adding cordova-plugin-compat@1.2, instead of removing and adding entire Android platform you can only remove files BuildHelper.java and PermissionHelper.java from folder platforms/android
