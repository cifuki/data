Q:Android Studio uses the concept of modules, whereas other IDEs like Eclipse use projects.
However AS File menu has the option to create a New Module as well as a new Project.

What are the differences between these two if any?

Which one is recommended to use?

A:From the documentation (Android Studio is based on Intellij IDEA) :


  Whatever you do in IntelliJ IDEA, you do that in the context of a
  project. A project is an organizational unit that represents a
  complete software solution.
  
  Your finished product may be decomposed into a series of discrete,
  isolated modules, but it's a project definition that brings them
  together and ties them into a greater whole.


For Android, it means one project per app, and one module per library and per test app.

There are multiple issues if you try to build multiple apps within the same project. It's possible, but if you try (like I did), you will see that almost everything is designed to work with a single app per project.  

For example, there is an option to "rebuild the project", which makes no sense with multiple apps, many other project settings would be useless, and the built-in VCS system isn't great when you have multiple repositories.
