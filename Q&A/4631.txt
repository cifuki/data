Q:I have already checked this post:
How to download dependency sources for Gradle project in IDEA?

But it didn't work for me. Maybe it is because they are referring to IntelliJ Idea, and I am having the issue with Android Studio.

I have tried adding 

apply plugin: 'idea'
idea {
    module {
        downloadJavadoc = true
        downloadSources = true
    }
}


Both to root's build.gradle file (I am in a multiproject setup) or to the application's build.gradle file.

My application's gradle file:

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.4.2'
    }
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    compile files('libs/android-support-v4.jar')
    compile 'com.nostra13.universalimageloader:universal-image-loader:1.8.4'
}
android {
    compileSdkVersion 17
    buildToolsVersion "17.0.0"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 7
        targetSdkVersion 16
    }
}


Then, in Android Studio when I click on any method from the universalimageloader library, I get to a screen saying that there are no sources attached. If I click attach sources it shows:


As you can see, only the lib's jar was downloaded to gradle cache. No *-sources.jar or *-javadoc.jar were downloaded. I have cleaned project, removed .gradle folder to force it to download again from maven. No luck.

I double checked that universal image loaded has sources and javadoc available in maven, so that is not the problem.

Thanks!

A:Currently Android Studio imports libraries with sources. As for java docs press F1. 

Old answer:

As we are talking about early preview, simplest fix wins.

For now is just manually add them to the project in Project Structure dialog. Things are even worse as now Android Studio will strip module files (iml) from all dependencies which are not related to native Android Gradle configurations and tasks e.g. module has robolectric dependency and extra task and config localTest is added in build.gradle. After you open Android Studio it will remove dependency, you need to add it again. 

For time being I am keeping iml files and .idea folder in my git. After launch

git checkout myproject/myproject.iml
