Q:Android Studio 0.4.2 was working fine and today I opened it and almost everything was red and the auto-completion had stopped working. I look at the imports and AS seems to be telling me it can't find android.support.v4 all of a sudden (offering me the option to remove the unused imports). (android.support.v7 seems to be fine though).

Things I have tried: 


Rebuilding the project
Cleaning the project
Syncing with Gradle Files
Closing the Project, closing AS and relaunching / reopening
File > Invalidate Caches / Restart
Examining Lint, didn't see anything obvious
Double checking all support libraries are up to date in the SDK manager
Examining my Build.gradle, although no changes and it's the same as usual, the way it was working all the time.


Here it is in case it's relevant:

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.7.+'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'android'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion 19
    buildToolsVersion '19.0.0'

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 8
        targetSdkVersion 19
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:19.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:gridlayout-v7:19.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:19.0.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.0.30'
    compile project(':libraries:facebook')
    compile files('libs/core.jar')
}


When I hit "Sync with Gradle" and open "Project Settings" I get a red error telling me I have duplicate library references and to remove the unused ones.. 


My project compiles and runs fine but I really need the autocomplete working!! Does anyone have any suggestions?

A:You've already gone down the list of most things that would be helpful, but you could try:


Exit Android Studio
Back up your project
Delete all the .iml files and the .idea folder
Relaunch Android Studio and reimport your project


By the way, the error messages you see in the Project Structure dialog are bogus for the most part. 

UPDATE:

Android Studio 0.4.3 is available in the canary update channel, and should hopefully solve most of these issues. There may be some lingering problems; if you see them in 0.4.3, let us know, and try to give us a reliable set of steps to reproduce so we can ensure we've taken care of all code paths.
