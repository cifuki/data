Q:Is it possible to know if some activity has been called for result, using startActivityForResult() or if was only started using startActivity()?

I need to control this, if its called for result the behaviour will be different.

A:When your activity was started just by startActivity() a getCallingActivity() method in target activity will return null.

When it was called by startActivityForResult() it will return name of calling activity.

See Docs for getCallingActivity():


  Return the name of the activity that invoked this activity. This is
  who the data in setResult() will be sent to. You can use this
  information to validate that the recipient is allowed to receive the
  data.
  
  
    Note: if the calling activity is not expecting a result (that is it
    did not use the startActivityForResult(Intent, int) form that
    includes a request code), then the calling package will be null.
  
  
  Returns
  
  The ComponentName of the activity that will receive your reply, or null if none.
