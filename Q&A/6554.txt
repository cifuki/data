            Receiver as inner class in Android

I want to create a broadcast receiver as an inner class in my main activity. 
But I have problems defining the broadcast receiver in manifest xml file,
because android can't find it.

Code:

public class MyActivity extends Activity{
    ...

    public class Receiver extends BroadcastReceiver{

        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            ....
        }

    }

    ...
}


Manifest:

<receiver android:name=".org.danizmax.myapp.MyActivity$Receiver" android:enabled="true">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="org.danizmax.myapp.BROADCAST_INITIAL_DATA"></action>
            </intent-filter>
</receiver>


I tried with:


.org.danizmax.myapp.MyActivity$Receiver
org.danizmax.myapp.MyActivity$Receiver
.MyActivity$Receiver 
.Receiver


I saw others also having similar problems, but did not find any answers.

So is it possible? If not, what's better way to use broadcast receivers?

Thanks!

A:Yes, it is possible.

The receiver android:name attribute should look like .path.to.class.MyClass$MyInnerClass
