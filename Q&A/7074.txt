Q:I'm getting this exception on a 4.4.2 device. Not reproducible on Android 4.3 device or lower.

Setup is I have a home activity (subclass of support ActionBarActivity). The home activity checks a boolean flag, and if true, launches a splash screen activity (yes, ideally the splash comes before the home activity, but let's assume I can't change it to work that way for now).

The splash screen is launched with startActivityForResult, it downloads some config options from the server, then finishes and returns the result back to the home activity.

Weird thing is this works fine on 4.3 and below, but on 4.4 devices, I get the above exception (full stack trace):

Based on the above, it looks like onStop (because I launch the splash activity on onCreate) is called before onResume for the Home Activity.

Why is this now causing problems in 4.4.x?

A:That doesn't seem right to me. The splash activity would now be the top activity in the stack, so the HomeActivity onStop lifecycle method would get called eventually. Coincidentally, I moved the startActivity call for the splash activity from onCreate to onResume in the HomeActivity, and the error goes away.
