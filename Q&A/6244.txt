Q:I need to fetch some data over the cloud from my app. I've watched the google IO video on RESTful android apps @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHXn3Kg2IQE&t=43m58s It recommends in the final slides to use a SyncAdapter to integrate with the Android System.

Later I learned that one has to use an Account to implement SyncAdapter. My app does not use an account. Users can freely download data without registration. Can I still use SyncAdapter? Is there a stock dummy account that I could use?

Edit: I do have a content provider for my app so that's not a problem

Edit2: I've just looked at the Weather and Stock apps under Settings -> Accounts & Sync. You can see that they allow syncing, but don't have a remove account button. On the other hand, Google, Facebook and Skype apps allow syncing PLUS they have a remove account button. This means Weather and Stock don't use accounts, whereas Google, Facebook and Skype do.

The tutorials I found @ http://ericmiles.wordpress.com/2010/09/22/connecting-the-dots-with-android-syncadapter/ and @ http://www.c99.org/2010/01/23/writing-an-android-sync-provider-part-1/ say that one MUST have an account to use Sync Adapter. :S ???

A:I have created a contact sync adapter where I don't have a account authorization and or configuration screens.  It wasn't that hard.  I don't think having to deal with the Android Account stuff was that much of a deal.

Quote from your tutorial link:


  The bad news is that there is no
  \xe2\x80\x9cstock\xe2\x80\x9d functionality to give you an
  easy way to provide an Account to the
  system. However, in the same Sync
  Adapter Example that comes with the
  SDK there is a lot of code you can
  borrow to give you Account
  functionality. Unless you desire a
  custom credentials screen, you can
  heist all the code in the
  com.example.android.samplesync.authenticator
  package with only a few minor changes.


So it's basically just a copy and paste from the example, that's pretty much what I did and it worked fine.

I don't know for sure but all the adapters that don't have "Remove Account" seems to be built-in ROM adapters on all the devices I've looked at.  I'm not sure you have to worried about it.
