Q:When I run "react-native run-android",it gives me error:"could not connect to development server...".


Package server is running and i can access it directly from browser
in mobile device.
My android device connected to computer has debugging enabled i
checked it using adb devices command.
My android version is 4.4.4 so i cannot use adb reverse command.
I have set the ip address and port in Dev setting.
Usb debug is on.
OS is windows7.


So how to fix the red error screen issue?Any suggestion is appreciated!

A:From the Docs:

Method 2: Connect via Wi-Fi 


  You can also connect to the development server over Wi-Fi. You'll
  first need to install the app on your device using a USB cable, but
  once that has been done you can debug wirelessly by following these
  instructions. You'll need your development machine's current IP
  address before proceeding.
  
  Open a terminal and type /sbin/ifconfig to find your machine's IP
  address.
  
  
  Make sure your laptop and your phone are on the same Wi-Fi network.  
  Open your React Native app on your device. 
  You'll see a red screen with an error. This is OK. The following steps will fix that. 
  Open the in-app Developer menu. 
  Go to Dev Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Debug server host for device. 
  Type in your machine's IP address and the port of the local dev server (e.g. 10.0.1.1:8081).
  Go back to the Developer menu and select Reload JS.
