Q:I am working on a mobile app on the Android platform (and going forward for the iPhone) and am evaluating the Flurry Analytics and Google Analytics platforms for the app. Both platforms have SDKs for the Android and the iPhone and seem very similar in most ways. 

Do any of you have experience with both or either and could you highlight some of the noticeable differences between the two?

thanks!

A:I have used Flurry which was really really easy to setup but kinda scary in all the information that it sends to the Flurry servers. You might want to check out this article about android apps and private data. At the very least you may want to give your users an option to opt out of sending the analytical data.

I actually ended up removing it from my apps, just because I didn't really use any of the data for anything, and it added extra threads running and extra KBs to the apk.
