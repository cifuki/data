Q:I am writing an Android Library Project basing on Android Bitmap class (call it AndroindLib) which contains only utility class (no activity). I tried to test it using Android JUnit, but it keeps complaining that can't find the AnroidLib.apk

What's the right way to Unit test Android Library Project?

A:Quoting the documentation:

"There are two recommended ways of setting up testing on code and resources in a library project:


You can set up a test project that instruments an application project that depends on the library project. You can then add tests to the project for library-specific features.
You can set up a standard application project that depends on the library and put the instrumentation in that project. This lets you create a self-contained project that contains both the tests/instrumentations and the code to test."
