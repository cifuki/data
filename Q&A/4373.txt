Q:I want to put a button next to a EditText and I want their heights to match. 

For example, from the built in Android browser:



The Go button is the same height as the EditText field.  I know I could wrap both these views in a parent layout view, and set both of their heights to fill_parent, and that would make them match.  However, I would like to do this without having to give the layout a static size.  I would rather have the EditText take whatever height it needs based on the font size and then have the button next to it match whatever height that might be.

Is this possible with an xml layout?

A:You will need to make the EditText wrap_content on its height and have the Button just fill_parent. You will need to have them both wrapped in a Layout parent. That way they are associated with the same Layout parent.

Try that and see how that works, if it helps let me know. If it doesn't maybe i can give you some code that will help you out.
