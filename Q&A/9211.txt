Q:In Android when you pop up a dialog the screen behind it dims.  Is there any way to control what that looks like?  For example making it dim more or less or using some kind of a pattern?

A:Yes, it is. You can control it.

After creating dialog:

WindowManager.LayoutParams lp = dialog.getWindow().getAttributes();  
lp.dimAmount=0.0f; // Dim level. 0.0 - no dim, 1.0 - completely opaque
dialog.getWindow().setAttributes(lp);


Upd: you can even add blur behind the dialog:

dialog.getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_BLUR_BEHIND);


Blurring is deprecated since API14:


  This constant was deprecated in API level 14.
  Blurring is no longer supported.
