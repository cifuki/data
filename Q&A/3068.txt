Q:A few users have been asking me Android lock screen widgets for my app - I believe they want a widget that stays on their lock screens and allows them to interact with the app.

I haven't been able to find any official documentation for this - the only thing I found was apps that will take home screen widgets and put them on the lock screen for you.

Any clues on where I learn more about building true lock-screen widgets?

A:Lock screen interaction is difficult. Android allows basic operations with two window flags (FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED and FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD). FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED works pretty consistently in that it will show on top of the lock screen even when security is enabled (the security isn't bypassed, you can't switch to another non-FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED window).

If you're just doing something temporary, like while music is playing or similar, you'll probably mostly be okay. If you're trying to create a custom lock screen then there's a lot of unusual interactions on all the different android platforms. ("Help! I can't turn off my alarm without rebooting my HTC phone"). 

getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED);
getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD);

FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED



  Window flag: special flag to let windows be shown when the screen is
  locked.


FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD



  Window flag:
  when set the window will cause the keyguard to be
  dismissed, only if it is not a secure
  lock keyguard. Because such a keyguard
  is not needed for security, it will
  never re-appear if the user navigates
  to another window (in contrast to
  FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED, which will only
  temporarily hide both secure and
  non-secure keyguards but ensure they
  reappear when the user moves to
  another UI that doesn't hide them). If
  the keyguard is currently active and
  is secure (requires an unlock pattern)
  than the user will still need to
  confirm it before seeing this window,
  unless FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED has also
  been set.
