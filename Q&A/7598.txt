Q:How can i tell if a user successfully completed a share intent? For instance if a user wanted to share an app via Facebook or Twitter.

Edit:

I am not looking at how to create an Intent for sharing. I want to know if the user actually shared anything. Or did the user hit the cancel button.

A:I don't think there is an assured way to do it.

You could initiate the send using startActivityForResult() and hope that the activity which handles the Intent replies with a RESULT_OK. But you can't rely on it to work always.
