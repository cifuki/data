Q:I have read a lot answers related to this topic, but none of them have worked to solve my problem, so need help with this:

I need to import a .aar file into a project created with Android Studio 1.1.0, I have imported it using the "New Module" option and actually I don't receive any error, I can build the application and run it, but when I try to use a class from this .aar file Android Studio doesn\xc2\xb4t find the reference to it, let's say it can\xc2\xb4t recognize the package that I want to include in my code. 

You are maybe thinking that I must add the dependency, I have already done that, It seems to not work.

So someone could tell me which is the correct way to import and use a .aar file in Android Studio 1.1.0

A:To import a .aar library:


Go to File>New>New Module
Select "Import .JAR/.AAR Package" and click next.
Enter the path to .aar file and click finish.
Go to File>Project Structure (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S).
Under "Modules," in left menu, select "app."
Go to "Dependencies tab.
Click the green "+" in the upper right corner.
Select "Module Dependency"
Select the new module from the list.
