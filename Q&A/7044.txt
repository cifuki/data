Q:In Android, I'd like to use the new OkHttp 2.0 to request some URLs, but I'd like more control over redirects. I've already found the option to enable or disable following HTTPS \xe2\x86\x92 HTTP or HTTP \xe2\x86\x92 HTTPS redirects, but I'd like to not follow any redirects, so I can update my GUI as soon as possible, and choose whether to follow them from application logic. I don't see an option to do this. Is it possible, and if so, how can I achieve this?

A:Yes it is possible in version 2.3.0

final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
client.setFollowRedirects(false);


For 3.x

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient().newBuilder()
                                            .followRedirects(false)
                                            .followSslRedirects(false)
                                            .build();
