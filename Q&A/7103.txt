A:I recently faced the same issue, The problem occurs because AVD tries to render graphics using system's graphics card and could not do that either because your system's graphics driver is not up to date or it does not support this so here is the solution.

Step 1: 


Update your Operating system graphics driver.
Restart your system.
Set your system's screen resolution as high as possible.
Try to start your AVD now.


Step 2:


If step 1 fails, Go to AVD Manager.
Edit your AVD.
Uncheck 'Use Host GPU' option.
Click Finish (Save).
Start AVD again.
