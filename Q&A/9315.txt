Q:This was my original question:


  I want to be able to open a pdf file
  in my app using the android's built in
  pdf viewer app, but i dont know how to
  start other apps. I'm sure i have to
  call start activity, i just dont know
  how to identify the app im opening and
  how to pass the file to that specific
  app.
  
  Anyone have a clue?


I just learned that the pdf viewer i have on my phone is actually made by HTC and that Adobe just barely released their android pdf viewer (which is great). So the new question is this: how do i verify that the user has installed adobe's viewer, and then how do i open the file in that app from my app?

A:AFAIK, Adobe has not documented any public Intents it wants developers to use. 

You can try an ACTION_VIEW Intent with a Uri pointing to the file (either on the SD card or MODE_WORLD_READABLE in your app-local file store) and a MIME type of "application/pdf".
