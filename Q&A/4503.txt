Q:My code is:

final String eulaKey = "mykey";
final SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getApplicationContext());
boolean hasBeenShown = prefs.getBoolean(eulaKey, false);


Always returns different values depending on os version. Tested in 2.2, 2.3.4, 3.2, 4.0.3 - returns correct value. But for device Zte blade with 2.3.7 with CianogenMod 7.1 - result is always false. I suppose default value for getBoolean.

Here is code writing boolean:

final String eulaKey = "mykey";
final SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getApplicationContext());
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = prefs.edit();
editor.putBoolean(eulaKey, true);
editor.commit();


Does anybody have any idea?

Update:
Comparing my current code with my previous version of code - there is no difference in code.
Only difference is in manifest: code works Ok  with minVersion=8 and targetVersion=8
Now I'm compiling with minversion=8 and target=13 /because of Admob/.
Maybe some APIs changed, but I found nothing on this.

SOLUTION:
-Starting app from shortcut and from menu gives me different DefaultSharedPreferences. After removing DefaultSharedPreferences from my code - it works perfect. I can't just say: people don't make shortcuts, so I had to change code.

A:Try it this way:

final String eulaKey = "mykey";
Context mContext = getApplicationContext();
mPrefs = mContext.getSharedPreferences("myAppPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = mPrefs.edit();
editor.putBoolean(eulaKey, true);
editor.commit();


in which case you can specify your own preferences file name (myAppPrefs) and can control access persmission to it. Other operating modes include: 


MODE_WORLD_READABLE
MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE
MODE_MULTI_PROCESS
