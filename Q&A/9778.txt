Q:Is it possible to make a secondary class to hold the OnClick Listener? Meaning not being created in the Activity class? 

I just find that putting OnClick listeners in the main activity class is just messy and I would rather have them in separate classes. Thanks

A:Sure, that's possible. Just create a class that implements View.OnClickListener and set that as listener to the View. For example:

public class ExternalOnClickListener implements View.OnClickListener {

    public ExternalOnClickListener(...) {
        // keep references for your onClick logic 
    }

    @Override public void onClick(View v) {
        // TODO: add code here
    }

}


And then set an instance of above class as listener:

view.setOnClickListener(new ExternalOnClickListener(...));


The parameterized constructor is optional, but it's very likely you'll need to pass something through to actually make your onClick(...) logic work on.

Implementing a class anonymously is generally easier to work with though. Just a thought.
