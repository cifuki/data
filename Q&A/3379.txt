Q:So, I made some changes to my build.gradle(app) file and android studio gives me this error (open the image in new tab for better viewing):


My build.gradle(app) file (this is not the edited file, I deleted new lines of code and still no luck/solution.):


Everything was quite working well until I made some changes in the build.gradle(app) file, but then I deleted those new lines of codes and android studio is still keep giving me the error.
The error relates to the compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:8.3.0'.
I have tried deleting/renaming those png images inside the stated folder,but then when I rebuild the project, the png images are automatically downloaded.
My build.gradle(project) file contains classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.5.0'. I want to know what causes this error, and how to fix it? Many thanks.

A:I just ran into the same issue. I don't know a fix for your exact problem, but I found a work around; I see your project has a deep file path hierarchy. Why not just move your project up from a lower level? 

Ex: C:\\Projects\\YourProject

That fixed the problem for me.
