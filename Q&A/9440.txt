Q:in Android Studio I generated a signed APK with keystore and so on. While installing the APK onto a device it fails with 'App could not be installed' and in Android Monitor I saw the following line:

Package com.my.app has no certificates at entry AndroidManifest.xml; ignoring!


Does anybody know what's wrong?

A:Try to signed your APK with version 1. Version 2 signed APK only
  compatible from 7.0 so it will not working on below 7.0 devices or try
  to generate v1 and v2 version APK. 
  
  [ Note: When you generate signed apk for above 7.0 devices and below 7.0 devices then please check v1 and v2 both option. ]


Here is the reference link for more about V2 version and here is the link for overview.
