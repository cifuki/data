Q:With Android 4.4 KitKat, Google is upgrading linux kernel to version 3.8 which is the required kernel version for Docker.

I don't know the AUFS part but will there be a way to run docker containers on android with this update?

A:According to the documentation, the Android kernel is missing quite a few of the kernel features needed by LXC.

Perhaps in the future with Docker 1.x, it might be possible to write a plugin that uses Android features instead of LXC. But for now, you would need to build a custom Android kernel and then build LXC for it.

There are some people actually working on that, and St\xc3\xa9phane Graber has a good summary of the difficulties on his blog.
