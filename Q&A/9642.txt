Q:There is a service that listens for some voice. If voice matches a string a certain method is invoked in the service object. 

public class SpeechActivationService extends Service {

     public static Intent makeStartServiceIntent(Context pContext){    

         return new Intent(pContext, SpeechActivationService.class);
     }

     //...

     public void onMatch(){
         Log.d(TAG, "voice matches word");
     }

     //...
}


This is how I start the service in my activity:

Intent i = SpeechActivationService.makeStartServiceIntent(this);
startService(i);


From this service method, how can I invoke a method that resides in the activity object? I don't want access from activity to service, but from service to activity. I already read about handlers and broadcasters but could not find/understand any example. Any ideas?

A:I would register a BroadcastReceiver in the Activity and send an Intent to it from the service.

It might look a bit long but you'll want to learn how to use those anyway ;)
