Q:I'm looking to learn OpenGL ES 2.0 on Android and the tutorials I've found are nearly all for using the SDK with Java. I want to use native code however so I want to do it through the NDK. 
The only tutorial/example I've found is the sample-stuff in the NDK itself.

Where can I find some NDK OpenGL ES 2.0 tutorials?
If there are no good tutorials out there, is it possible to use the Java OpenGL tutorials to learn how to use it in the NDK as well? For example do the methods map 1:1 from java to native?

A:I've created an example on how to combine UI done in Java with native NDK code that does all the OpenGL rendering. It is possible to do without resorting to GLSurfaceView and JNI calls for rendering each frame like done in the NDK sample.
