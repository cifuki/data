Q:I am reusing ImageViews for my displays, but at some point I don't have values to put it.

So how to clear an ImageView in Android?

I've tried:

mPhotoView.invalidate();
mPhotoView.setImageBitmap(null);


None of them have cleared the view, it still shows previous image.

A:I used to do it with the dennis.sheppard solution:

viewToUse.setImageResource(0);


it works but it is not documented so it isn't really clear if it effects something else in the view (you can check the ImageView code if you like, i didn't).

I think the best solution is:

viewToUse.setImageResource(android.R.color.transparent);


I like this solution the most cause there isn't anything tricky in reverting the state and it's also clear what it is doing.
