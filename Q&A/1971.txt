Q:I found that I am using a deprecated method for noficitations (notification.setLatestEventInfo())

It says to use Notification.Builder. 


How do I use it?


When I try to create a new instance, it tells me:

Notification.Builder cannot be resolved to a type

A:This is in API 11, so if you are developing for anything earlier than 3.0 you should continue to use the old API.

Update: the NotificationCompat.Builder class has been added to the Support Package so we can use this to support API level v4 and up:
