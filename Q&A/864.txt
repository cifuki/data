Q:What tutorials and libraries are available which can help beginners to develop 2D and 3D games on Android using OpenGL-ES? I'm looking for tutorials which can help me learn OpenGL-ES, and I'm looking for OpenGL-ES libraries which can make life easier for beginners in OpenGL-ES.

Since Android is still small, I guess it may be help-full to read iPhone OpenGL-ES tutorials as well, as I suppose the OpenGL-ES functionality is much the same.

I have found the following useful information which I would have liked to share:

Android tutorials:  


DroidNova: Basic tutorial covering polygons, no textures  
anddev forum with some tutorials


Other Android OpenGL-ES information:  


Google IO lecture regarding games, not 
much OpenGLES  
The The Khronos Reference Manual is also relevant to have, but its not exactly the best place to start.


iPhone OpenGL-ES tutorials (where the OpenGl-ES information is probably useful):

As for libraries which a beginner might use to get a simpler hands-on experience with OpenGL-ES, I have only found Rokon, which is recently started, thus has many holes and bugs. And it's gnuGPL licensed (at the moment) which means it cannot be used, if we wish to sell our games.

What else is out there?

A:The site you mentioned is very good, but I think the best one I have found is by INsanityDesign.  It is a port of the great OpenGL nehe tutorials.  This is a great place to start, it gives you source at different levels that you can play with and change to see what different parts do.  Other than that reading OpenGL documentation, will help as well.  I am not great at the OpenGL stuff, but have been able to figure things out using the resources I mentioned.
