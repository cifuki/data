A:Use the following piece of code:

Writer writer = new StringWriter();
exception.printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(writer));
String s = writer.toString();


There used to be a way to extract an exception stacktrace into the String in one line with Log.getStackTraceString call. But starting from Android 4.0 (API 14) that method is not reliable anymore, as it returns an empty string for UnknownHostException (see Android issue #21436 for the details, in short: "to reduce the amount of log spew that apps do in the non-error condition of the network being unavailable" Android engineers made IMHO a dubious decision to modify Log.getStackTraceString method).  

Thus it is better to use the code I provided at the beginning of this post.
