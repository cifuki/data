Q:I'm trying to run AwesomeProject on my Nexus5 (android 5.1.1).

I'm able to build the project and install it on the device. But when I run it, I got a red screen saying


  Unable to download JS bundle. Did you forget to start the development server or connect your device?


In react native iOS, I can choose to load jsbundle offline. How can I do the same thing for Android? (Or at least, where can I configure the server address?)

Update

To run with local server, run the following commands under your react-native project root directory


react-native start > /dev/null 2>&1 &
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081


please take a look at dsissitka's answer for more details.

To run without a server, bundle the jsfile into the apk by running:


create an assets folder under android/app/src/main
curl "http://localhost:8081/index.android.bundle?platform=android" -o "android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle"

A:To bundle JS file into your apk while having your server running (react-native start) download bundle into assets directory of your app:

curl "http://localhost:8081/index.android.bundle?platform=android" -o "android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle"


With the next release (0.12) we'll fix react-native bundle command to work with android projects as expected.
