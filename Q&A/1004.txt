A:Go into your AndroidManifest.xml file


Click on the Application Tab
Find the Text Box Labelled "Icon"
Then click the "Browse" button at the end of the text box
Click    the Button Labelled: "Create New Icon..."

Create your icon
Click Finish
Click "Yes to All" if you already have the icon set to something
else.  


Enjoy using a gui rather then messing with an image editor! Hope this helps!
