Q:I registered a ContentProvider in AndroidManifest.xml, and the ContentProvider.onCreate() was called even before the Application.onCreate(). I don't understand this behavior, in my opinion, It's more natural that Application.onCreate() be called before any of the components in the application. Could someone tell me the timing of Application.onCreate() and other components' onCreate()  gets called?
