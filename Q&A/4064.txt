Q:I'm trying to get a Spinner to load up with no selected value. Once the user selects a value it then takes them to another page. 

This is proving to be a problem because at present, the page just loads straight away before the user gets a choice to choose.

My spinner class is set up the same way as Google's: http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-spinner.html

So basically, is it possible have a spinner that loads with nothing selected because at present, it loads the first item in my string array.

Only if there is no data. If you have 1+ items in the SpinnerAdapter, the Spinner will always have a selection.

Spinners are not designed to be command widgets. Users will not expect a selection in a Spinner to start an activity. Please consider using something else, like a ListView or GridView, instead of a Spinner.



EDIT

BTW, I forgot to mention -- you can always put an extra entry in your adapter that represents "no selection", and make it the initial selected item in the Spinner.
