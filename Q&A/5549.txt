A:In addition to the Samsung, LG, and Motorola links you already posted, I just found a service by Perfecto Mobile that has a free trial.  And, since I'm making a list, here's a service by DeviceAnywhere that's not free.

Of course, there are many companies that will test your apps for you, but I thought Duarlander was neat because it was comunity-based.  And, if you're looking for cheap testing, TestingAndroid claims to test for $19.

These are just some free/cheap options, mostly where you do your own testing.  Obviously there are many big companies out there that would love to "work with you" on testing (for a price).
