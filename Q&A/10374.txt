Q:I am trying to implement pull-to-refresh in Android. I know there is SwipeRefreshLayout but with all the newly designed Google apps like Drive (see attached) for Lollipop, I have noticed there is a new refresh  icon that comes in the view when pulled. I tried looking it online but in vain. 
Has Android released this as a part of the Material Design? Any ideas about how to implement it?

EDIT: Some people have pointed out how this is a duplicate of How to implement a Pull-to-refresh. It is not the same question. You'll see it if you read the question properly.

A:This is SwipeRefreshLayout . Version 21 of the support library includes it replacing the old style.
