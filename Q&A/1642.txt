Q:In my application, I have 2 LinearLayout's right above each other. Via a menu option, I want to be able to make the bottom one disappear, and have the top one drop down over the disappeared LinearLayout.

The problem is, I have no idea on how to do this in Java.

It doesn't have to be animated, I want to hide the Layout on return of another activity (the menu), in OnActivityResult. The menu activity sets a boolean on which I check in OnActivityResult, and according to it's value I determine if I need to hide or show the bottom Layout:

// Only change value if it is different from what it was.
if(mUseVolumeButtonAsPTT != resultData.getBoolean("UseVolumeButtonAsPTT")){
    mUseVolumeButtonAsPTT = resultData.getBoolean("UseVolumeButtonAsPTT");
    if(!mUseVolumeButtonAsPTT){
        // Hide lower LinearLayout.
    } else {
        // Show lower LinearLayout.
    }
}


Can anybody give me a hint or a link on how I should do this?

A:You can call view.setVisibility(View.GONE) if you want to remove it from the layout.

Or view.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE) if you just want to hide it.

From Android Docs:


  INVISIBLE
  
  This view is invisible, but it still takes up space for layout purposes. Use with setVisibility(int) and android:visibility.
  
  GONE
  
  This view is invisible, and it doesn't take any space for layout purposes. Use with setVisibility(int) and android:visibility.
