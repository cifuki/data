Q:Having searched here and elsewhere for answers to my problems, I'm still unable to fix this.

I've installed Eclipse, ADT Plugin, and the Android SDK. My problem is that the SDK Manager won't open, whether it is launched from Eclipse or directly. The command prompt window flashes up briefly, then closes.

I've tried several proposed solutions: Various configurations of my Path and JAVA_HOME variables, installation of  the 32 and 64 bit versions of the JDK, running as Administrator, all with no success.

The different components are installed at these paths:

JDK - C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_11
JRE - C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7
SDK - C:\\ADT\\sdk


My JAVA_HOME is set to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_11
My Path includes C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_11\\bin at the beginning.

I've tried reinstalling the SDK and the installer correctly identifies the location of Java, and yet still it won't work.

Can anyone help me out with this? I'm practically tearing my hair out!

A:Open cmd,

go to android sdk folder,

in tools/lib/, edit find_java.bat,

you will see the lines like below, add black line to your file and save.


  rem Check we have a valid Java.exe in the path. The return code will
  
  rem be 0 if the command worked or 1 if the exec failed (program not
  
  found). for /f %%a in ('%~dps0\\find_java.exe -t') do set java_exe=%%a


this 


  set java_exe="C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_11\\bin\\java.exe" 
  
  if not defined java_exe goto :CheckFailed
  
  :SearchJavaW 
  
  rem Check if we can find a javaw.exe at the same location
  
  than java.exe. rem If that doesn't work, just fall back on the
  
  java.exe we just found. for /f %%a in ('%~dps0\\find_java.exe -t -w')
  
  do set javaw_exe=%%a if not exist %javaw_exe% set javaw_exe=%java_exe%
  
  set javaw_exe="C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_11\\bin\\java.exe"


i hope it helps
