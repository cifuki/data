Q:I'm running Ubuntu 16.04. And on Android Studio when I try to run my application in the emulator I get the following error:


  FATAL EXCEPTION: main
                    Process: project name here, PID: 2528
                    java.lang.RuntimeException: Canvas: trying to draw too large(216090000bytes) bitmap.

  etc...


I did have to run through some hoops to get my emulator working however, needed to create a sym-link so I can run the emulator on AMD. Not sure if this is part of the problem. And for the life of me I cannot figure why it continues to do this. In my group there are others who emulate the project just fine on the same emulated phone and SDK.

A:Move your image in the (hi-res) drawable to drawable-xxhdpi. But in app development, you do not need to use large image. It will increase your APK file size.
