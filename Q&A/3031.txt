Q:I have an Android application that "spams" the LogCat and I would like to remove its logcat entries in order to have an output more readable.

Is it possible to have a filter that remove the LogCat entries for a specific tag name? Or a search pattern that does the trick?

A:Yes. Create a filter where the "By log tag" field is

^(?!.*(MYTAG)).*$


where MYTAG is the tag you don't want to see. I am not a regexp expert (a "regexpert"? ;-) ) so there may be a simpler way to do that negation, but I just tried that and it works.

You can play around with the filter in the field just above the Log Cat message area, by entering filter strings there, like this:

tag:^(?!.*(DeskClock|dalvik|wpa)).*$


which will show all messages except tags "DeskClock", "dalvik", and "wpa".
