Q:There is the way to change visibility of View, but how can I change programmatically visibility of layout defined in XML? How to get layout object?

<LinearLayout
    android:id="@+id/contacts_type"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:visibility="gone">
</LinearLayout>

A:Have a look at View.setVisibility(View.GONE / View.VISIBLE / View.INVISIBLE).

From the API docs:


  public void setVisibility(int visibility)
  
      Since: API Level 1
  
      Set the enabled state of this view.
      Related XML Attributes: android:visibility
  
  Parameters:
      visibility     One of VISIBLE, INVISIBLE, or GONE.


Note that LinearLayout is a ViewGroup which in turn is a View. That is, you may very well call, for instance, myLinearLayout.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE).

This makes sense. If you have any experience with AWT/Swing, you'll recognize it from the relation between Container and Component. (A Container is a Component.)
