Q:I'm trying to obtain the key hash for integrating facebook into my Android app.  But all over the net I can't find the way to do it on MAC OS X, only for Windows.

If someone could light me with the proper way to obtain the key hash I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you!

A:Sorry, what key tool?

If you want to generate a Facebook App ID/Key, go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps and create a Facebook app.

If you want the keytool that you can use to create certificates etc, that is included in the jre.

Explanation for how to deal with the keys and hash here:
