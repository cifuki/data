Q:Can I disable drag functionality when the user tries to drag the map with his fingers without   disturbing the Zoom in and Zoom out? 

Any one please suggest an idea of doing this!
  Thanks for your Precious help!!

A:I think here's what you're looking for:

Inside Google Maps Android v2


  Scroll (pan) gestures
  
  A user can scroll (pan) around the map by dragging the map with their
  finger. You can disable scrolling by calling
  UiSettings.setScrollGesturesEnabled(boolean).
