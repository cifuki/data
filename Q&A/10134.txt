Q:I am using Sencha Touch 2.3.1 for developing cross platform application and to deploy it to native platforms I am using Cordova 3.3.0

I followed  this tutorial. Following the tutorial I was able to run the .apk file in the emulator. Now I want to run the application on my device. Even though I connect my device to the laptop using a usb, I am not able to run the application on my device. Any help will be appreciated.

A:To have the project run on your device instead of in the emulator, you basically only have to plug in your device before you run cordova run android.

Cordova will run the emulator only if it can't find a device connected.

Before you run cordova run android, I advise you to run the command adb devices to check if your device is found by the android sdk tools.

If it's not, you need to enable USB debugging on the device and install an adb driver for your device.

Edit:

As this answer seems to get up votes, I think it would be a good idea to improve it a little...

There's actually a --device option you can add when you run cordova run android to force to start on the device (without that an emulator is started if no device is found, that can sometime be annoying).
