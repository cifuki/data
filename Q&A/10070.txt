Q:I would like to make a ProgressDialog cancelable by the back button but not by a screen tap.  Currently I use setCancelable(true).

However, in some newer devices a tap on the screen also cancels the ProgressDialog. I'd like to disable the screen tap action while the ProgressDialog is shown.

A:Use setCanceledOnTouchOutside(false).
