Q:I have searched everywhere and read the official doc of Google. But I still don't see the difference between them. 

When should we use ProgressBar and when should we use ProgressDialog?

A:ProgressBar is a View (like TextView, ImageView, Button, etc..), which can be used in your layout to show some progress.

ProgressDialog is a Dialog with 'built-in' ProgressBar. Dialogs can be used to make user wait while something is being computed. ProgressDialog makes it easier to show progress of your computation in dialog.
