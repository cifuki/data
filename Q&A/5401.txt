Q:I have an ImageView that I use to show progress via an AnimationDrawable.  When I want to show my progress spinner, I do this:

animDrawable.start();
ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view, "alpha", 1.0f).setDuration(300).start();


When I want to hide the spinner, I do this:

ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view, "alpha", 0.0f).setDuration(300).start();
animDrawable.stop();


However, this has the effect that the animation stops immediately.  I would like it to stop only after the ObjectAnimator has completely faded to 0.0 alpha.  Is there a way I can setup something along the lines of an "AnimationCompleted" callback?

A:The more modern way of doing this is to use the ViewPropertyAnimator:

view.animate()
    .alpha(0f)
    .withEndAction(new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
        // Do something.
      }
    })
    .start();


Or, if you're using RetroLambda:

view.animate()
    .alpha(0f)
    .withEndAction(() -> {
      // Do something.
    })
    .start();
