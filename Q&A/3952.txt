Q:I am getting a 'Module not specified' error in my run config. I have no module showing in the drop down yet I can see my module no probs. The issue came about when I refactored my module name, changed the settings.gradle to new name.

Now when I go to project structure and select my module nothing shows in the screen, not even an error.

I'm not 100% sure, but the icon beside my module looks like a folder with a cup and not a folder with a phone.

My exact steps -


Open in Android view
Refactor directory name
refactor module name
change settings.gradle contents: name to new name

A:Resync your project gradle files to add the app module through Gradle


In the root folder of your project, open the settings.gradle file for editing.
Remove include ':app' from the file.
On Android Studio, click on the File Menu, and select Sync Project 
with Gradle files.
After synchronisation, add include ':app' back to the settings.gradle file.
Re-run Sync Project with Gradle files again.
