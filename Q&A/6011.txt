A:Updated

Now there are a lot of cloud providers , providing solutions like MBaaS (Mobile Backend as a Service). Some only give access to cloud database, some will do the user management for you, some let you place code around cloud database and there are facilities of access control, push notifications, analytics, integrated image and file hosting etc.

Here are some providers which have a "free-tier" (may change in future):


Firebase - https://firebase.google.com/
AWS Mobile - https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/
Azure Mobile - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/mobile/
IBM Bluemix: https://console.bluemix.net/developer/mobile/starter-kits
Kinvey - http://www.kinvey.com


Also, the host yourself solution:


Parse (now a DIY toolkit) - http://parseplatform.org/

Google App Engine has a DataStore : https://developers.google.com/appengine/

You can create a free account, and host a sophisticated web service. As long as your app doesn't generate really massive server transactions and data daily, its free.
SQL storage is available too, but at a cost.
