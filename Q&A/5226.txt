Q:If I am not wrong gradle assemble does run gradle assembleDebug and gradle assembleRelease, but I believe gradle build also does the same, so what are the different between them both?

A:Assemble will build your artifacts, and build will assemble your artifacts with additional checks.

build depends on assemble, so build is sort of a superset of assemble

You can have a look on the tasks that will be executed by using the --dry-run flag. e.g.

gradlew build --dry-run


You will see that apart from assemble also lint and test will be executed.
