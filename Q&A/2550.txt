Q:Today while running an app from Android Studio, it didn't build from my latest code.

I looked for a Clean & build option but I couldn't find one.

So my question is: what is Android Studio's equivalent of Clean & build?

A:Android studio is based on Intellij Idea. In Intellij Idea you have to do the following from the GUI menu.

Build -> Rebuild Project
