Q:So far we have developed apps in android that create database on runtime. We like to know how can we access a pre-built or existing database/sqlite file in our android app? Please provide detail

A:Take a look at the documentation for android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.

In particular, there's an openDatabase() command that will access a database given a file path.

SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(path, null, 0);


Just specify the path to your database as the path variable, and it should work.
