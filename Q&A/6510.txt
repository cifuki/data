Q:I updated my project to the latest Android APIs and the project now has multiple deprecated methods. Does Android Studio have a cool way of listing all classes containing said methods, such as the TODO window? I know I can go through every class and search methodically through the code, but I would rather like to make it easy on my self. Any help, tips and or hints are greatly appreciated.

A:If it helps someone else heres the answer to my question:

If you go to Analyze -> Inspect Code...

When your project has been inspected click on Code maturity issues and tada, there is a list of all Deprecated API usages :)
