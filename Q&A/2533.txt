Q:Is there any difference between OnTouchListener and OnClickListener? I am not asking from programming point of view, but from User Experience point of view. 

Which one is better to use?

Do we need to implement both?

A:which one is better to use?


It really depends on your requirement. 
onTouch gives you Motion Event. Thus, you can do a lot of fancy things as it help you separate state of movement. Just to name a few


ACTION_UP
ACTION_DOWN
ACTION_MOVE


Those are common actions we usually implement to get desire result such as dragging view on screen. 

On the other hand, onClick doesn't give you much except which view user interacts. onClick is a complete event comprising of focusing,pressing and releasing. So, you have little control over it. One side up is it is very simple to implement. 


  do we need to implement both?


It is not necessary unless you want to mess up with your user. If you just want simple click event, go for onClick. If you want more than click, go for onTouch. Doing both will complicate the process. 

From User point of view, it is unnoticeable if you implement onTouch carefully to look like onClick.
