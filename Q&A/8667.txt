Q:In our App we're using FCM, so Firebase analytics is also working. 
However, from the dashboard, we can only see top devices. 



Is there a way to see more details about devices?


All the models
All OS
Region of all the devices?
etc.


For instance, We want to verify whether some users are being tracked in analytics (by their models), but can't find anyway to do that.

A:There is one way to see the list of devices and OS. In the screenshot you uploaded, click on the Add Filter -> User Property -> {Device Model, Device Brand, App Version, OS Version etc.} will be listed there. 



If you have not specified any User Properties your self then also, firebase is Automatically collected user properties. Check the list of properties automatically collected by firebase.

Note: If firebase has collected any of the properties itself you will as I mentioned above.

Good luck!!
