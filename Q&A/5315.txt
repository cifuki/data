Q:I'm creating projects with dependencies in Android Studio. I know how to link projects by adding modules.

But I realized that 'importing modules' create a copy of the libProject inside the project.

Is there a way to prevent that ? Like an 'external module' ? 

Since i'm in charge of both project, I want to be able to push changes to the libProject Repo, without having to copy paste files between folders.

Thanks

A:Yes, you can do it. The module needs to have a Gradle build file set up for it. If it's got that, then in the project you're linking to it, add this to the settings.gradle file at the project root:

include ':libraryName'
project(':libraryName').projectDir=new File('/path/to/library')


where the path you specify in the second line is the path to the directory containing the library's build.gradle file. The path can be relative or absolute.
