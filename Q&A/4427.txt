Q:I am new to this site, and I come with a question about Android.

Is there any way to convert a Bitmap to grayscale? I know how to draw a grayscale bitmap (using canvas operations: http://www.mail-archive.com/android-developers@googlegroups.com/msg38890.html) but I really need The actual bitmap in gray colors (or at least something that could be converted to a bitmap later on).
Do I have to implement it by hand (pixel by pixel operations)?

I've searched a lot, and still could not find. Anyone knows a easy/efficient way to do it?

Thanks a lot!

A:Isn't that exactly what the code you're linking to does? It takes a color bitmap ("bmp"), creates a duplicate bitmap ("bm"), and then draws the color bitmap into "bm" using the filter to turn it into grayscale. From that point on, you can use "bm" as an actual grayscale bitmap and do whatever you want to do with it.

You'd need to tweak the sample a bit (it's using hard-coded sizes, you may want to just clone the size of the original bitmap), but other than that, this seems to be as ready-to-use as it gets, depending on what you want.
