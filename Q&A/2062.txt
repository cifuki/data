Q:Is there something else that should be called?

showDialog(TIME_DIALOG_ID);


It's in this tutorial but says deprecated in Eclipse.

A:From http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html


  public final void showDialog (int id) Added in API level 1
  
  This method was deprecated in API level 13. Use the new DialogFragment
  class with FragmentManager instead; this is also available on older
  platforms through the Android compatibility package.
  
  Simple version of showDialog(int, Bundle) that does not take any
  arguments. Simply calls showDialog(int, Bundle) with null arguments.


Why


A fragment that displays a dialog window, floating on top of its activity's window. This fragment contains a Dialog object, which it displays as appropriate based on the fragment's state. Control of the dialog (deciding when to show, hide, dismiss it) should be done through the API here, not with direct calls on the dialog.
Here is a nice discussion
