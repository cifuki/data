I have an EditText inside each row of a ListView.  For some reason, when I tap the EditText, it briefly gains focus but then immediately loses it.

I have tried these things:

listView.setItemsCanFocus(true);
editText.setFocusable(true);



While the EditText is (briefly) focused, the Enter key says Next and the auto-correct bar is present.  When it loses focus, the soft keyboard stays up, but the Enter key becomes a Return Arrow, and the auto-correct bar disappears.

A:EditTexts within ListViews are extremely tricky. I'd suggest you avoid them like the plague if possible. When I was messing with them, this answer was helpful though. If you only have a few items you can always just use a ScrollView.
