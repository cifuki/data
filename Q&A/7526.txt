Q:In layout XML files, the red exclamation mark is displayed left of @drawable references. Almost all drawables have this mark:



The content of shape_detail_btn_border.xml is as below. It is a group of shapes and does not have any broken image resource:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
android:shape="rectangle">
    <solid android:color="@android:color/white"/>
    <corners android:radius="5dp"/>
    <stroke android:width="1dp" android:color="@color/bapul_color_d5d5d5"/>
</shape>


I hover the mouse on the mark and nothing shows up. what does this mean?

Note that the Android Studio version is 1.4 (AI-141.2288178), currently the most recent version. And, there's no problem to build and run the app at all.

A:In short, it's not an error from the code. It tells that "Android Studio failed to display the thumbnail of the given drawable."

Thanks @Ramz for finding an answer at https://stackoverflow.com/a/33032200/361100. I'll leave this post because this question is more descriptive than the linked one.
