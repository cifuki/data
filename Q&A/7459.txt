Q:I am trying to organize my code for SVN so I can work from multiple locations without issue and potentially add more developers. The problem is that I can't get the code into a new project easily. I am trying to create a project from existing code.

Once I select the folder, the "main activity" shows up, but I can never use it. I've tried deleting all the .project files and what not in the folder as well, but the thing is always greyed out and I can never get it to import.

Why is it greyed out? What do I need to do to get it to import?

A:I played around with this a bunch and found out that it was conflicting with another similarly named activity that already existed in the workspace. The error message "Select at least one project" was covering up that message. It would appear very quickly and then switch to select at least one project.

To get around this, I deleted all the projects from my workspace. I didn't know which one it was because I am making an app that is being versioned and branded for different companies.
