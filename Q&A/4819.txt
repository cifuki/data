Q:When I Checkout a project form Google Cloud, Android Studio sais: "2 modules cannot be loaded. You can remove them from the project" and I cannot see the project. The error is in the iml files app.iml and ProjectName.iml.

Thanks!

A:Delete the *.iml files and rebuild the project (Build > Rebuild), it should be ok after that.
