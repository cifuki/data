A:You need to create fonts folder under assets folder in your project and put your TTF into it. Then in your Activity onCreate()

TextView myTextView=(TextView)findViewById(R.id.textBox);
Typeface typeFace=Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(),"fonts/mytruetypefont.ttf");
myTextView.setTypeface(typeFace);


Please note that not all TTF will work. While I was experimenting, it worked just for a subset (on Windows the ones whose name is written in small caps).
