Q:The default animation when the Back button is pressed is a slide from left to right. I'd like to replace that with a custom animation. I'm currently thinking that some combination of onBackPressed() and overridePendingTransition will do the trick, but I haven't been able to get it working.

A:I think you shouldn't use finish() because the data stored by the Views will be erased

@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    super.onBackPressed();
    overridePendingTransition(R.anim.zoom_enter, R.anim.zoom_exit);
}
