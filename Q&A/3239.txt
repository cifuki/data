Q:I have a string like this : +33123456789 (french phone number). I want to extract the country code (+33) without knowing the country. For example, it should work if i have another phone from another country. I use the google library https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/.

If I know the country, it is cool I can find the country code :

PhoneNumberUtil phoneUtil = PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance();
int countryCode = phoneUtil.getCountryCodeForRegion(locale.getCountry());


but I don't find a way to parse a string without to know the country.

A:Okay, so I've joined the google group of libphonenumber ( https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/libphonenumber-discuss ) and I've asked a question.

I don't need to set the country in parameter if my phone number begins with "+". Here is an example :

PhoneNumberUtil phoneUtil = PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance();
try {
    // phone must begin with '+'
    PhoneNumber numberProto = phoneUtil.parse(phone, "");
    int countryCode = numberProto.getCountryCode();
} catch (NumberParseException e) {
    System.err.println("NumberParseException was thrown: " + e.toString());
}
