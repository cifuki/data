Q:I just updated to Android Studio 3.4 (Canary 5). Then I opened my existing project (which worked perfectly on Android Studio 3.3 Beta) and received this error:

ERROR: Unsupported method: AndroidProject.getVariantNames().
The version of Gradle you connect to does not support that method.
To resolve the problem you can change/upgrade the target version of Gradle you connect to.
Alternatively, you can ignore this exception and read other information from the model.


Full clean & rebuild, Invalidate cache & restart, re-import project does not work. 

gradle-wrapper.properties:

distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.4-all.zip


build.gradle (project level):

dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.3'
}

A:You need to disable this setting in Android Studio: 

File > Settings(or Preferences for previous versions) > Experimental > Only sync active variant
