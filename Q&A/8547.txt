Q:I am creating an three EditText in my xml file using code like this.

<EditText
            android:id="@+id/name_edit_text"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_below="@+id/profile_image_view_layout"
            android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
            android:layout_marginLeft="10dp"
            android:layout_marginRight="10dp"
            android:layout_marginTop="20dp"
            android:ems="15"
            android:hint="@string/name_field"
            android:inputType="text" />


When i run the app it looks like this in my device.



But i want to give a look like without using any background image.



So how that can be done? Any idea or suggestion will be helpful.

A:You have a few options.


Use Android assets studios Android Holo colors generator to generate the resources, styles and themes you need to add to your app to get the holo look across all devices.
Use holo everywhere library.
Use the PNG for the holo text fields and set them as background images yourself. You can get the images from the Android assets studios holo color generator. You'll have to make a drawable and define the normal, selected and disabled states.

This answer is now outdated. Android has tinting API and ability to theme on controls directly now. A good reference for how to style or theme any element is a site called materialdoc.
