Q:Problem:

In my manifest my application word was having Yellow Background, when I do Alt+Enter it gives me above options, I clicked Disable inspection just to check it, but when I do Alt+enter, but again after doing alt+enter I didn't get any option for getting it enabled?

After clicking Disable Inspection, I am not getting any option for Enable Inspection, Is there any way to get Enabled again?
