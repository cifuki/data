Q:I am completely new to Firebase analytics. I am trying to send an event which shows statistics about my API call. 

endTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;

// [START event]
Bundle params = new Bundle();
params.putString(FirebaseConstants.PHONE_NUMBER, Utility.getPhone());
params.putLong(FirebaseConstants.DURATION, endTime);
FirebaseAnalytics
            .getInstance(getContext())
            .logEvent(FirebaseConstants.BALANCE_CHECK, params);
// [END event]


But I only see the name of the event, number of users and occurrence count. 24 hours have already passed and I don't see my custom properties. For reference, I want to see a phone number(Utility.getPhone()) and the time which API call takes(endtime). Maybe it is possible that it does not send anything because I created custom params in my FirebaseConstans class
