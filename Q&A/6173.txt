Q:Looking for some help. I just upgraded my android app to fabric and now the app gives an error on this line:

Crashlytics.start(getApplicationContext());

Gradle: error: cannot find symbol method start(Context)

I tried commenting out that line, but then the crashes are not getting logged. How do I initialize Crashlytics in the new fabric framework? Am I missing something?

Thanks in advance for your help.

A:Since Crashlytics is now part of Fabric the initialization process has changed, but is still simple. Instead of using Crashlytics.start() you should now use, but in the Application creation:

public class App extends Application {

    ...

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Fabric.with(this, new Crashlytics());
    }

    ...

}


For a more richer example, see how Cannonball canonical sample app is doing:

public class App extends Application {

    ...

    private TwitterAuthConfig authConfig;

    ...

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        authConfig = new TwitterAuthConfig(BuildConfig.CONSUMER_KEY, BuildConfig.CONSUMER_SECRET);
        Fabric.with(this, new Crashlytics(), new Twitter(authConfig), new MoPub());
    }

    ...

}
