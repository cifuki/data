Q:Is there any equivalent of Intel's HAXM for AMD (Windows OS) or has anybody been able to hack HAXM to make it work on AMD processors (Windows OS)?

Also, would Genymotion (http://www.genymotion.com) be significantly faster compared to the default Google APIs ARM / x86 system images provided by Google?

My exact dev machine specs:


OS: Windows 7 Ultimate
Processor: AMD FX 8120 8 Core 2.81 GHz


Thanks in advance!

A:From the Android docs (March 2016):


  Before attempting to use this type of acceleration, you should first
  determine if your development system\xe2\x80\x99s CPU supports one of the
  following virtualization extensions technologies:
  
  
  Intel Virtualization Technology (VT, VT-x, vmx) extensions 
  AMD Virtualization (AMD-V, SVM) extensions (only supported for Linux) 
  
  
  The
  specifications from the manufacturer of your CPU should indicate if it
  supports virtualization extensions. If your CPU does not support one
  of these virtualization technologies, then you cannot use virtual
  machine acceleration.
  
  Note: Virtualization extensions are typically enabled through your
  computer's BIOS and are frequently turned off by default. Check the
  documentation for your system's motherboard to find out how to enable
  virtualization extensions.


Most people talk about Genymotion being faster, and I have never heard anyone say it's slower. I definitely think it's faster, and it will be worth the ~20 minutes it will take to set up just to try it.
