Q:I have multiple virtual devices, some of them can't be deleted. 

Error message is


  The android virtual device XXX is currently running in an emulator and
  cannot be deleted


when I just have restarted Ubuntu and only started Eclipse.

A:In Linux/*nix and OSX:


Find the .android folder in your $HOME directory.
In .android there should be a avd folder
In the avd folder should be one or multiple .ini file and a corresponding *.avd virtual device folder.
Delete both the .ini file and the .avd folder you want to get rid of.
Return to the Android sdk and AVD manager.


I hope this helps...
