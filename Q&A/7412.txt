Q:I have some text in my application that says in case you need extra help, please email us and here is the email address, blah, blah.

But I want them to be able to click the email link and have their email client open. Is that possible? Or is that bad practice?

If it is reasonable practice, how can it be done?

A:This is a very reasonable request and the Linkify class will turn every email address into an appropriate link for you. Simply add the autoLink attribute to your XML:

<TextView
    ...
    android:autoLink="email" />
