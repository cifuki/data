Q:Does anyone know if there a way to increase the size of the logcat history/buffer in Android Studio? I remember there was a way to do it in Eclipse and was hoping Android Studio had a similar setting.

A:You can also do it per project, via the IDE:
Settings->Editor->General->Console: tick "Override console cycle buffer size.  Enter your desired size in the text box.
