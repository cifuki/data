Q:My specific question is: How I can achieve an effect like this: http://youtu.be/EJm7subFbQI

The bounce effect is not important, but i need the "sticky" effect for the headers. Where do I start?, In what can I base me? I need something that I can implement on API 8 to up.

Thanks.

A:There are a few solutions that already exist for this problem. What you're describing are section headers and have come to be referred to as sticky section headers in Android.


Sticky List Headers
Sticky Scroll Views
HeaderListView
