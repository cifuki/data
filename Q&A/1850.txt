Q:I have installed adt version 22.6.1 already 2 days ago. It was working fine. Suddenly, When I open eclipse today, it keeps showing me following error:

This Android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 22.6.1 or above. Current version is 22.2.1.v201309180102-833290.  Please update ADT to the latest version.

Here is screenshot of my eclipse's Android SDK Manager : 


I tried with following steps to resolve my issue as discussed in this Link


Help | Install new software 
Select the ADT update site (there are two, one with http:// and one with https://. If one doesn't work, try the other. 
Select the developer tools section and press next. 
You should see a dialog that says This software is already installed, an update will be performed instead. Clicking OK will lead to 22.6.1 being installed.


But unfortunately it didn't work for me. 

Here is a screenshot I am attaching which shows the error I am getting while updating the tools.



How can I get rid of it?

A:I have solved this issue yesterday.

Follow the steps :
Help -> Install New Software -> Add -> (Give any name suppose NewUpdate) -> add this url : https://dl-ssl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.2 -> OK

Now it will list the available updates, which should ideally be adt 20.x.x

Select the list items Let it be installed. Eclipse will restart and Its done.

I hope this will helpful for you :)
