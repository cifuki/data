Q:I read on many other topics that the Android emulator starts really slow. Indeed, it takes +15 mins to start. However, on my machine is slow even after that.

The 'phone' responds with a 3-4 seconds delay and everything has a huge lag.

Is there any way to improve the performance of my laptop (Asus 1201N) is too rusty for the Android emulator?

PS: Tried in different emulator resolutions and the result is the same

Edit: My laptop has 2 cores with HyperThreading. And it shows as 4 CPU in Device Manager. However, when using the emulator, just one of the graphs is at 100%. Can I do something to make it work multi core?

A:Do you have "Disable Boot Animation" checked?

Also, if that doesn't fix it, one thing that helps is that you never actually have to close the emulator screen while you're coding.  If you click debug when it's already open, your APK will get uploaded to the emulator and start pretty much immediately.  For some reason it took me a while to figure out that I didn't have to manually close the emulator.
