Q:I have implemented deep linking in my app. I added this intent filter in my manifest file, and the deep linking is working.

<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /> 
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /> 
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /> 
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.VIEW" /> 
    <data
        android:host="www.mywebsite.com"
        android:pathPrefix="/something"
        android:scheme="http" />
</intent-filter>


The problem is that through deep linking, my app is launching on top of current app. If I am in Gmail and I click a link, then my app is launching on top of Gmail. I want to launch my app differently.

If my app is already running in background and I click on a link in Gmail which redirects to my app, I will have two instances of my app running at the same time; one in the background, and another on top of Gmail. I want to run only one instance of my app at a time, so it's not also on top of the current app (Gmail). How can I do that?

A:the accepted answer didn't work for me, here is what did:

intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
startActivity(intent);
finish();


from the official doc:


  If set, and the activity being launched is already running in the current task, then instead of launching a new instance of that activity, all of the other activities on top of it will be closed and this Intent will be delivered to the (now on top) old activity as a new Intent.
