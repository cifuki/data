Q:I already have a free app in the Android Market, but I want to add a paid-for version with better features. I can't upload the same up with some changed constants to unlock those features as the Market tells me I already have an app with that package name in the market. 

What's the cleanest way of doing this?

A:The Android SDK formally addresses the issue of a shared or common codebase with something called a library project.

http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html

Basically, the shared code is defined as a library project, then a paid and a free version are simply two different projects in your eclipse workbench, both referencing aforementioned library project. 

At build-time, the library project gets merged with either of your releases, which is what you want.

The Android SDK example source code contains a project called TicTacToe that will help you get started with library projects usage.

Good luck.
