Q:I need to use a unique ID for an Android app and I thought the serial number for the device would be a good candidate. How do I retrieve the serial number of an Android device in my app ?

A:TelephonyManager tManager = (TelephonyManager)myActivity.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
String uid = tManager.getDeviceId();


getSystemService is a method from the Activity class.  getDeviceID() will return the MDN or MEID of the device depending on which radio the phone uses (GSM or CDMA).  

Each device MUST return a unique value here (assuming it's a phone).  This should work for any Android device with a sim slot or CDMA radio.  You're on your own with that Android powered microwave ;-)
