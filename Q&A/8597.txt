Q:I previously developed on Eclipse and just migrated to Android Studio.
Everything works fine, it's better and faster.

I work on real device, and Android Studio recognizes it without issue.

But when I disconnect and reconnect my device, it doesn't recognize my device anymore, I have to exit and restart Android Studio.

I can't find a way to "Reset adb" like Eclipse Feature.



Can ADB be restarted from within Android Studio? If so, how?

A:What I usually do when I get this error is restarting the adb server by typing in the command into Terminal:

adb kill-server
adb start-server




However this can be achieved in Android Studio. Clicking the Monitor button you can launch the same program you have referenced from Eclipse.







If you do not see this you may need to update your Platform Tools from the SDK Manager button.
