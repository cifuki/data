Q:There is a new Android Studio update: https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/recent/androidstudio030released

The link says:


  The improved performance is made possible by changes in Gradle 1.8 and
  Android Gradle plugin version 0.6.+


So I changed my dependencies like this:

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.6.+'
    }


But I don't know where I can change the Gradle 1.6 to 1.8 ...

And when I compile the app I've got this error:


  Gradle: A problem occurred evaluating project.
  
  Gradle version 1.8 is required. Current version is 1.6


Where can I change the version ?

Thanks in advance :)

A:I am not sure if this will help you but here is what fixed it for me:

Open up this file in your project:

<Project>/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties

Edit the distributionUrl line and set it too:

distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.8-all.zip


Rebuild your project.

Update: You might want to use gradle-2.8-all.zip now.
