Q:I am trying to create a simple Android application that has a ActivityList of information, when the application starts, I plan to start a Service that will be constantly calculating the data (it will be changing) and I want the ActivityList to be in sync with the data that the service is calculating for the life of the app.

How can I set up my Activity to be listening to the Service? Is this the best way to approach this problem?

For example, if you imagine a list of stock prices - the data would be being changed regularly and need to be in sync with the (in my case) Service that is calculating/fetching the data constantly.

Thanks in advance

You have three major options, as I see it:


Polling. The Activity periodically asks the Service for the latest data. IMHO, this option sucks, but it's certainly possible.
Callbacks. Per jax's answer, the Activity registers a callback object ("observer") with the Service. The Service invokes a method on the callback when the data changes, which in turn updates the UI. You can see an example of using that with a Service here.
Broadcast Intents. The Service broadcasts an Intent via sendBroadcast() on a data change. The Activity registers a BroadcastReceiver using registerReceiver(), and that BroadcastReceiver is notified of an incoming broadcast. This triggers the Activity to load the latest data from the Service, or possibly just to get the latest data out of extras in the broadcast Intent. You can see an example of using that technique with a Service here.
