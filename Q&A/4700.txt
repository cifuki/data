Q:I am trying to build android for ionic in linux but its showing me an error like this 

     [Error: Failed to find 'ANDROID_HOME' environment variable. 
      Try setting setting it manually.
      Failed to find 'android' command in your 'PATH'. 
      Try update your 'PATH' to include path to valid SDK directory.]

at maybeClose (child_process.js:743:16)
at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:810:5)


and i've added this in my bashrc file 

export ANT_HOME="/usr/bin/ant"
export PATH="$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin"
export HOME="/home/kumar"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/android-sdk-linux/tools"
export ANDROID_PLATFORM_TOOLS="$HOME/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME:$ANDROID_PLATFORM_TOOLS:$PATH"


I'm thinking i've given the path but i dont know why its showing me this error .. Please help....

A:Android Home should be the root folder of SDK. 

export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/android-sdk-linux"


EDIT:  Open terminal and type these commands. (yes, on a ternimal , not in bashrc file)

export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk-macosx
PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools    


and then in the same terminal just type android. If configured you would be able to use build commands from this terminal. (it's a temporary solution)
