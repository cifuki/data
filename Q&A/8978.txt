Q:I have a touch event exception that is causing my game to crash on tablets (or more specifically, honeycomb)... My game works fine on my phone and I haven't heard of this happening to anyone that isn't running Android 3.0 or higher. Here is the relevant log info...

E/AndroidRuntime(26487): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: pointerIndex out of range
E/AndroidRuntime(26487):    at android.view.MotionEvent.nativeGetAxisValue(Native Method)
E/AndroidRuntime(26487):    at android.view.MotionEvent.getX(MotionEvent.java:1549)

E/AndroidRuntime(26487):    at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchTouchEvent(ViewGroup.java:1291)

... And here is the code that is calling it. Seems fine to me, but maybe there is a bug in honeycomb that hasn't been fixed yet? The line number 665 from the log above corresponds to the float x = event.getX(id); line. It must have something to do with the way I am getting the which variable maybe? But it works fine on the phones/2.3 and lower...

int action = event.getAction();
int actionCode = action & MotionEvent.ACTION_MASK;

if(actionCode == MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_UP || action == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP) {
    int which = action >> MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_ID_SHIFT;
    int id = event.getPointerId(which);
    float x = event.getX(id);
    float y = event.getY(id);


Any help/ideas would be greatly appreciated as I am trying to make my game available to tablet users as well. Thanks.

A:My problem was that it was actually calling event.getX(1) when there wasn't actually two ids. So I made sure that there were two ids with event.getPointerCount() >= 2 and it now works.  Maybe you'll have the same luck!
