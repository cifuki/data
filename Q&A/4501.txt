A:Above asked question has been solved as according to documentation at developer.google.com https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client#get-config


  2018 Edit : GCM Deprecated, use FCM


The file google-services.json should be pasted in the app/ directory.
After this is when I sync the project with gradle file the unexpected Top level exception error comes. This is occurring because:

Project-Level Gradle File having

dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.0.0'
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.3.0-beta1'
}


and App-Level Gradle File having:

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.1.1'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.5.0' // commenting this lineworks for me
}


The top line is creating a conflict between this and classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.3.0-beta1' So I make comment it now it works Fine and no error of
