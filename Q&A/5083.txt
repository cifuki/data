Q:I am trying to achieve this in a ViewPager

The first fragment (blue) is displayed and the beginning of the next fragment must be displayed as well, so the user understands he can swipe to switch views.
The idea is scroll 20% of the screen programmatically to the left.

Any thoughts are welcome

EDIT: This is exactly what I need to to: the central view needs to overlap both side views

A:You can try adding this to your PageAdapter:

public float getPageWidth(int position) {
    if (position == 0 || position == 2) {
        return 0.8f;
    }
    return 1f;
}
