Q:I am a UX architect working with a team of Android developers that are mostly junior. We are having issues properly setting line height in Android. 

We are using the Material Design spec as our guide for our app. In particular, you can see line height specs here:

https://material.google.com/style/typography.html#typography-line-height

Let's use Body 2 as our example. The spec says the type is 13sp or 14sp, and the leading (line height - same thing) should be 24dp. 

Here's the problem: these devs are telling me there is no such way to set line height like that in the code. Instead, they are telling me to measure the distance between the two lines of text and give them that measure - let's say it's 4dp. They want this for each style of text we are using. 

We are using a Sketch > Zepelin flow for spec. 

It seems odd to me to be able to create a font style (which could easily be class/style in the code) that is 13sp with 24dp leading, and not be able to set the leading, but instead have to add a 3rd measure to the mix. There is no place in Sketch or Zepelin for such a measure "between lines."

Is this really the way it is done, or is there a proper way to set line height?

A:The solution is simple. Just use these two attributes in your TextView, lineSpacingExtra and lineSpacingMultiplier.

For example,

<TextView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="80dp"
    android:lineSpacingMultiplier="2.5"
    android:lineSpacingExtra="6dp"/>


EDIT

These are only meant for controlling the spacing between the lines and not characters (aka Kerning). To control character spacing, you can use this library which I made, KerningViews.

EDIT 2

The android:lineSpacingExtra add the actual extra space between the lines. You should be using this. Just to give you more information, I gave you the android:lineSpacingMultiplier attribute which works as a scale factor with the height of the TextView.

If you want 15dp of space between lines, use android:lineSpacingExtra="15dp", and you are good to go.
