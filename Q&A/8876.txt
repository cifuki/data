A:You can exclude dependencies in the build.gradle file of your module.

compile('com.google.apis:google-api-services-drive:v2-rev170-1.20.0') {
    exclude module: 'httpclient' //by artifact name
    exclude group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents' //by group
    exclude group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents', module: 'httpclient' //by both name and group
}
