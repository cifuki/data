Q:I'm trying to export a signed Android application in Eclipse.

I think I'm going in the right direction:


Right click on project > Android Tools > Export Signed Application Package
The Export Android Application wizard appears.
Select the project I want to export, click Next.
The Keystore Selection screen appears.


It looks like this (forgive my ascii, file uploader not working):

[ ] Use existing keystore
[o] Create new keystore

Location: __________ [Browse]
Password: __________
Confirm: __________


I don't have an existing keystore, so I click the "Create new keystore" radio button.  The location field remains active, must be filled, and if I browse to some directory I'd like the keystore to go after it's created, the dialog complains that "Keystore path is a directory."


Is it actually possible to create a keystore with this dialog?
If not, how can I create one?  My google-fu has provided only failed experiments for me so far.  I'm using Eclipse on a PC.


The Compile and sign with Eclipse ADT section in the android developer page seems to think this will just work out, but I can't get past this part of the dialog.  I can export unsigned .apk files just fine.

Thank you!

A:You should be able to create a keystore with the dialog, yes. After navigating to the folder you want to use, type a name in the 'File name:' field in the file browse window, e.g. sophie.keystore. Then you should be able to proceed. 

Alternatively, you can create it on the command line as described in the docs.

The command looks like this:

keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000


for example:

keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/dcaunt.keystore -alias dcaunt -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
