I know how to install the apk file in to the emulator by command prompt and all that.
But i want to know is it possible to install same apk file in to multiple emulator by giving any specific name ?
Actually i have to test one apk file in to many device. and for that i have started many device. I know how to install it. if the all device are open then it will not get install. So is there any alternate to install that apk file by giving any specific device Emulator id or any name ???
Please help me if there is any idea for it. . .
Thanks.

A:Yes, you can install an apk on a particular device.

In command, type: 

adb devices
// list of devices and its unique ID...


Then type:

adb -s "<deviceIDfromlist>" install "<path-to-apk>"
