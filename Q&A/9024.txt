Q:I have used the Android Device Art Generator but would like the same thing for iOS devices. Does such a thing exist?

I want to take screenshots of my iOS apps and then wrap them nicely in iPad an iPhone graphics for marketing material purposes.

I realise I could do this by hand in Photoshop but a really simple drag and drop solution like the Android one would be very useful.

A:On the AppStore Resource Center you can find Apple Product images that can be used to promote your app. There's also some guidelines on how to use the resources correctly.

UPDATE: 
Guidelines apart, a friend found a service today that does exactly what you want:
