Q:In my application I am using WebView and in that I am using JavaScript alert( ) method but its not working, no pop-up appears.

in my manifest file I have added 

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>


and in activity file I have added 

mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/demo.html");


In layout xml file I have added

<WebView 
    android:id="@+id/webview"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
/>


Any clue how to enable full JavaScript in WebView?



Update

Thanks mark
 the alert() method in the html file are working now :) .

Now there are two issues in WebView :
1: I am using a <textarea> in the html file that i am loading in WebView , and trying to write in Hindi language font in it, but when i try to write Hindi text it displays as symbols (  rectangle symbols like [] ) .

when i do the same in firefox browser on desktop it works fine.
any clue how to give support for multiple language in textarea in WebView ?

2: When I am clicking submit and trying to open the value of text in alert() method in another java script it doesn't work , does it mean even after using WebChromeClient 
its applicable only for current loaded html page and not javascripts called from that page ?
