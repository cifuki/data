Q:Is it possible to use the new Navigation Architecture Component with DialogFragment? Do I have to create a custom Navigator?

I would love to use them with the new features in my navigation graph.

A:No, as of the 1.0.0-alpha01 build, there is no support for dialogs as part of your Navigation Graph. You should just continue to use show() to show a DialogFragment.
