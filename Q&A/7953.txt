Q:Is the onUpgrade method of SQLiteOpenHelper ever called? If so, when is it called and by what? If it is not called by the developers, then why is it there? What really happens with that function? I have seen examples where it drops all the tables, but then a comment says that dropping all the tables is not what you should do. Any suggestions?

A:It is called when you construct a SQLiteOpenHelper with version newer than the version of the opened database. What to do depends on the changes in the database that are made between the old and new versions. The only case when you don't drop a changed table is when the change is noting more than an added column. Then you can use ALTER TABLE statement to add the new column to the table signature.
