A:Text to speech is built into Android 1.6+. Here is a simple example of how to do it.

TextToSpeech tts = new TextToSpeech(this, this);
tts.setLanguage(Locale.US);
tts.speak("Text to say aloud", TextToSpeech.QUEUE_ADD, null);

Here are instructions on how to download sample code from the Android SDK Manager:


Launch the Android SDK Manager.

a. On Windows, double-click the SDK Manager.exe file at the root of the Android SDK directory.

b. On Mac or Linux, open a terminal to the tools/ directory in the Android SDK, then execute android sdk.
Expand the list of packages for the latest Android platform.
Select and download Samples for SDK.
When the download is complete, you can find the source code for all samples at this location:


/sdk/samples/android-version/

(i.e. \\android-sdk-windows\\samples\\android-16\\ApiDemos\\src\\com\\example\\android\\apis\\app\\TextToSpeechActivity.java)
