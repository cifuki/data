Q:I have created an AlertDialog using AlertDialog.Builder, but the Dialog border takes up too much space on the screen. How do I remove the border? I have tried using another Activity to emulate the dialog with a transparent background, but the dialog is used repeatedly, and creating a new Activity every time introduces a significant amount of lag.

The answer from here mentions that it can be found in the ApiDemos, but i can't seem to find it.

A:Alright, I'll answer my own question. Basically, instead of using AlertDialog.Builder, create a regular Dialog using it's constructor, and use a suitable theme instead of the default Dialog theme.

So your code would look something like this:

Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this, android.R.style.Theme_Translucent_NoTitleBar);


Hope this helps someone else.
