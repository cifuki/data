Q:I add a bunch of FragmentTransactions to the back stack in one Tab, and I want to clear them ALL from the back stack when the user selects a different Tab. I can't find a method to clear stuff off the back stack, only methods to pop them off, and these don't even return the Fragment to you so you can close them. Any ideas?

A:If you add many Fragments to the backstack and want to remove them all you can do this: popBackStack(null, FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE)
