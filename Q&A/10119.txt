Q:I created an application with the create.bat on windows and compiled it with ADT and the latest SDK.

It launches and displays the cordova display but it doesnt fire the deviceready event as it keeps saying "connecting to device". The same applies for the emulator. It works when I change the OS to 4.0 for the emulator though.

Is this normal because 4.2 has just been released and I have to wait for an update ?

A:It's 1 am and I finally have my app running again. Android 4.2 includes some apparently security related changes to webView.addJavascriptInterface, which stops the default bridge mode from working.

I expect there will be a better fix in the next version, but if you need a quick fix, try this  update to CordovaWebView.exposeJsInterface

private void exposeJsInterface() {
    int SDK_INT = Build.VERSION.SDK_INT;
    boolean isHoneycomb = (SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB && SDK_INT <= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR2);
    if (isHoneycomb || (SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.GINGERBREAD)) {
        Log.i(TAG, "Disabled addJavascriptInterface() bridge since Android version is old.");
        // Bug being that Java Strings do not get converted to JS strings automatically.
        // This isn't hard to work-around on the JS side, but it's easier to just
        // use the prompt bridge instead.
        return;            
    } else if (SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB && Build.MANUFACTURER.equals("unknown")) {
        // addJavascriptInterface crashes on the 2.3 emulator.
        Log.i(TAG, "Disabled addJavascriptInterface() bridge callback due to a bug on the 2.3 emulator");
        return;

    } else if (SDK_INT == Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR1) {            
        Log.i(TAG, "Disabled addJavascriptInterface() bridge callback for 4.2");
        return;


    }
    this.addJavascriptInterface(exposedJsApi, "_cordovaNative");
}
