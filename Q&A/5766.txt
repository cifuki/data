Q:I am new to Android, and was studying the framework and it compelled me to ask this question. Since we are extending Activity in Android, there has to be main somewhere in Activity or there is an hidden class that Activity implements that contains main. 

I looked everywhere but couldn't find it. I would appreciate if any one could give a clear idea on it.

A:Android uses the java language, but executes using a modified runtime model. As others have said, there is a manifest included in each package. The launchpoint is specified in this manifest. Go to the android site and do the basic tutorials. This will get you up and running with an understanding of create/deploy/run process and the basic app life cycle.
