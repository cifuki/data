Q:I want to develop an Speech recognizer in android, which should work in offline. As the android's built-in speech recognizer uses google server which needs internet, i want an alternative which works in the absence of internet.

Please suggest me some way to achieve the above feature.

A:Pocketsphinx can run on Android. See 

CMU Sphinx (at SourceForge)

The code is currently can be checked out from subversion (its better to use subversion and not to download snapshots), it's very easy to use it, just import the project into eclipse and run it on your device:
