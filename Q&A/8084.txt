A:Update as of 2017: The link once again mentions UTF-8 as the default for the Android plattform.

Update as of 2016: The link I provide no longer mentions UTF-8. Still, the default charset can still be found on a device with the mentioned API call.

Old answer: The default character encoding for Android is UTF-8, as specified by the JavaDoc of the Charset.defaultCharset() method. It can be validated by calling that same method.
