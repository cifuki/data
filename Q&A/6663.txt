Q:I know I can't use DELETE in a query (that is a shame by the way), I will get the following error:

<i>Error:error: Observable query return type (LiveData, Flowable etc) can only be used with SELECT queries that directly or indirectly (via @Relation, for example) access at least one table.</i>


But I can't use @Delete(WHERE... xxx)
So how do I delete a specific row by a parameter?

A:The beauty of room is, we play with the objects. As per requirement you can use 
for kotlin:

@Delete
fun delete(model: LanguageModel)


for Java:

@Delete
void delete(LanguageModel model)


it will delete the exact object which is stored in the db with the same values. LanguageModel is my model class and it works perfectly.
