Q:We recently released an android application that pulls information from an external server.  Last week we moved from shared hosting to a dedicated server, that went smoothly up until we started getting complaints that users were getting server not found errors.  We checked on our android-based phones (Droid) and everything worked fine.  The vast majority of users are fine, there seems to be a small percentage of t-mobile users running android o/s 1.5 (g1, mytouch 3g) that seem to be having trouble.  We believe these are all previous users of the application.

Anyway, we've been trying to find a fix (similar to ipconfig /flushdns) but have been unable to do so.  Has anyone had experience with something similar to this?  Thanks.

A:You have a few options:


Release an update for your app that uses a different hostname that isn't in anyone's cache.
Same thing, but using the IP address of your server
Have your users go into settings -> applications -> Network Location -> Clear data.


You may want to check that last step because i don't know for a fact that this is the appropriate service. I can't really test that right now.  Good luck!
