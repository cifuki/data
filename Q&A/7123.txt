Q:In an Android app, whenever the activity launches, the textbox gets the focus and the soft keyboard pops up automatically. I have tried to stop this by using following line in onCreate method, but it does not work.

((InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE)).hideSoftInputFromWindow(EditText.getWindowToken(), 0);

A:I know this is old but maybe it will help someone in the future...

I haven't seen anyone suggest "stateHidden"

From the Android docs - android:windowSoftInputMode

Your manifest file would look like:

<activity
    ...
    android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden|adjustResize"
    ...
>
