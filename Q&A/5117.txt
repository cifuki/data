Q:Can't install Java 7 (installer refuses).

Can install Java 8.

But then starting Android Studio, it says it needs to install the legacy JDK 6, which is not going to work for me because our projects are already 1.7.

A:We now have an official page describing what to do:
http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/configuration/osx-jdk

Please, please don't edit Info.plist; that has many downsides (including broken patches and application signatures breaking etc). As of Android Studio 1.0 we have a different way of setting the JDK to be used by the IDE.
