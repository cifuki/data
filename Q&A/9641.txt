Q:I am running Android Studio on OS X Yosemite. I am trying to simply delete an AVD from Android Studio AVD Manager. Every time I attempt to delete it I get the message "The selected AVD is currently running in the Emulator. Please exit the emulator instance and try deleting again." The problem is that the emulator is NOT running. I even closed down all the studio and rebooted the computer. It still says the same thing. Anybody seen this before? I would really like to remove the AVD.

Thanks in Advance!

A:Search for *.lock folders under .android folder and delete those. This should tell Android studio that the AVD is not running.
