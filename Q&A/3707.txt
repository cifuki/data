Q:My activity_main.xml is below, as you see, the height is set 40 dip.
    

And in MyEclipse, it looks like below:



But when I run it on my phone, it looks like below:



So my question is why the real height of the progressbar is not the one I set? How to increase the height of the progressbar?

A:From this tutorial:

<style name="CustomProgressBarHorizontal" parent="android:Widget.ProgressBar.Horizontal">
      <item name="android:progressDrawable">@drawable/custom_progress_bar_horizontal</item>
      <item name="android:minHeight">10dip</item>
      <item name="android:maxHeight">20dip</item>
</style>


Then simply apply the style to your progress bars or better, override the default style in your theme to style all of your app's progress bars automatically.

The difference you are seeing in the screenshots is because the phones/emulators are using a difference Android version (latest is the theme from ICS (Holo), top is the original theme).
