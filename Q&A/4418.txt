Q:When I am trying to generate android apk by using ./gradlew installRelease, I get this error in console:

~/React-Native/mockingbird/android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/release/drawable-mdpi-v4/src_resources_img_loading.gif: error: Duplicate file.
~/React-Native/mockingbird/android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/release/drawable-mdpi/src_resources_img_loading.gif: Original is here. The version qualifier may be implied.


I tried Build->Clean Project via Android Studio and ran ./gradlew installRelease again; it didn't work either. 

Also, I tried deleting the build folder, but it doesn't help either.

A:Give some tips for you, hope it's work.

Update with "react": "16.7.0", "react-native": "0.57.8"

Custom node_modules/react-native/react.gradle to solve the Duplicate file error perfectly. Add following code into currentBundleTask's creation block (after doFirst block)

doLast {
    def moveFunc = { resSuffix ->
        File originalDir = file("${resourcesDir}/drawable-${resSuffix}");
        if (originalDir.exists()) {
            File destDir = file("$buildDir/../src/main/res/drawable-${resSuffix}");
            ant.move(file: originalDir, tofile: destDir);
        }
    }
    moveFunc.curry("ldpi").call()
    moveFunc.curry("mdpi").call()
    moveFunc.curry("hdpi").call()
    moveFunc.curry("xhdpi").call()
    moveFunc.curry("xxhdpi").call()
    moveFunc.curry("xxxhdpi").call()
}




You can create script to do it automatically.


Create android-react-gradle-fix file
Create script android-release-gradle-fix.js file
Update package.json file:

"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node ./android-release-gradle-fix.js"
},


That's it! Run npm install to get awesome.

Note: If you run npm install on ci like jenkins, you may get error: postinstall: cannot run in wd %s %s (wd=%s) node => just use npm install --unsafe-perm instead
