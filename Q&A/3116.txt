Q:I am about to create my first Android native (so not browser based) app and looking for some good practices regarding icon creating/provisioning.
Since it should support multiple devices/resolutions I thought it is best to use SVG to create them. There is at least this lib: http://code.google.com/p/svg-android/ that promises to offer support for SVG on Android.

So far, I have not found resources describing the usage of this or another library as a means to render SVG Icons on the device, so I am a bit reluctant in using it. The best I have seen so far is using SVG as the source format for pre-rendering png based icons in different resolutions.

So my questions is: Are SVG icons a good option to use directly on the device without a png pre-rendering step (does it work at all), and if, why does nobody seem to use this approach?

A:For Android older than Lollipop, your best practice for SVG on Android is going to be to use a tool to convert your SVG to PNG at the size(s) you're interested in. Existing SVG support for Android is not comprehensive of what you're likely to find in an SVG file, and even if it were, the support is not built into the OS so using them directly for icons is definitely out.

Beginning with Lollipop (API 21) see What are best practices for using SVG icons on Android?. Thanks to @MarkWhitaker @AustynMahoney for pointing this out.
