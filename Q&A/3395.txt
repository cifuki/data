Q:Here is the Docked mode option for "Preview" window.



I removed the docked mode i.e. undocked it. And here is what I got.



There is no more "Docked Mode" option. Now I cannot properly work with designing layouts. Preview automatically hides when I change anything in the layout.

A:Here is the simple solution for reverting to "Docked Mode".


Select the Preview Window
Go to Window menu > Active Tool Window




There you go. The Preview window is in Docked Mode. And there is the option for Docked Mode again.
