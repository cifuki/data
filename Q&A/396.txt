I got errors to delete all @Override above functions. I have Windows 7 x64, jvm7 x64. Does anyone have clue what is wrong ?( I done Android Tools -> Fix Project Properties but didn;t help )

A:That isn't the problem, Jack. Android SDK isn't x64, but works ok with x64 jvm (and x64 eclipse IDE).

As helios said, you must set project compatibility to Java 5.0 or Java 6.0.

To do that, 2 options: 


Right-click on your project and select "Android Tools -> Fix
Project Properties" (if this din't work, try second option)
Right-click on your project and select "Properties -> Java
    Compiler", check "Enable project specific settings" and select
1.5 or 1.6 from "Compiler compliance settings" select box.
