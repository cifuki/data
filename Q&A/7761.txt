Q:I recently downloaded the ViewPagerIndicator library and imported it into android studio. After adding it to my project I get a rendering error "The following classes could not be found:" and points to com.viewpagerindicator.IconPageIndicator. 

The steps I took were Files->Import Module->'library name', Project Structure -> Dependencies -> + the imported module. Then to my layout xml file I added the <com.viewpagerindicator.IconPageIndicator />, after that I got the missing class problem.

It compiles just fine and I went through all of the build.gradle and settings.gradle files and compared them to what they should be online.

MyApp->build.gradle has compile project(':library') under dependencies
settings.gradle has include ':library' with no build errors.

A:First of all, you must import your library project by following that path:

File --> New --> Import Module


After you have imported the library project successfully, you must check your build.gradle file inside your project's folder if the following line is present at the "dependencies" section:

implementation project(':NameOfTheLibProject')


Then your project must be built successfully.
