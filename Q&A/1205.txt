Q:In my current project I make use of multiple .so files. These are located at the armeabi and armeabi-v7a folder. Unfortunately one of the .so files is a 6MB and I need to reduce file size. Instead of having a fat APK file, I would like to use just the armeabi files and remove the armeabi-v7a folder.

According to the NDK documentation, armeabi-v7a code is extended armeabi code which can contain extra CPU instructions. This all goes beyond my expertise, but I question why one would like to have both armeabi-v7a and armeabi code. There must be a good reason to have both, right?

On my test devices this all seem to work fine. These have ARM v7 CPU's. Is it safe to assume that everything works now?

A:Depends on what your native code does, but v7a has support for hardware floating point operations, which makes a huge difference. armeabi will work fine on all devices, but will be a lot slower, and won't take advantage of newer devices' CPU capabilities. Do take some benchmarks for your particular application, but removing the armeabi-v7a binaries is generally not a good idea. If  you need to reduce size, you might want to have two separate apks for older (armeabi) and newer (armeabi-v7a) devices.
