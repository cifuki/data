A:You can use the ADB via a terminal to pass the file From Desktop to Emulator.

adb push <file-source-local> <destination-path-remote>


You can also copy file from emulator to Desktop

adb pull <file-source-remote> <destination-path>


How ever you can also use the Android Device Monitor to access files. Click on the Android Icon which can be found in the toolbar itself. It'll take few seconds to load. Once it's loaded, you can see a tab named "File Explorer". Now you could pull/push files from there.
