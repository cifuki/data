Q:I am getting the following error while trying to build my project on Android Studio:


  ERROR: No signature of method:
  com.crashlytics.tools.gradle.CrashlyticsPlugin.findObfuscationTransformTask()
  is applicable for argument types: (java.lang.String) values:
  [DevDebug]


How to solve this?

A:This seems to be an issue related to version "1.28.0" of "io.fabric.tools:gradle".

Usually this kind of problem occurs if '...:n.+' structure of versioning is used inside dependency (app level/project level). In this case:

dependencies {
    classpath 'io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+'
}


Because it auto updates the version, and as a result, if there is any fatal error in the latest version, the project is likely to face a crash due to build/runtime error.

Android Studio always suggests to 'Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds...'

One working solution was found to be downgrading to a specific previous version like 1.27.1 or any other stable latest version prior to 1.28.0, like:

dependencies {
    classpath 'io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.27.1'
}


Remember to check both gradle files (app level/project level) to see where the above dependency has been declared and change accordingly.
