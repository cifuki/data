A:In Eclipse, Goto Window-> Show View -> Other -> Android-> Logcat.

Logcat is nothing but a console of your Emulator or Device.

System.out.println does not work in Android. So you have to handle every thing in Logcat. More Info Look out this Documentation.

Edit 1: System.out.println is working on Logcat. If you use that the Tag will be like System.out and Message will be your message.
