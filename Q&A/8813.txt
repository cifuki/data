Q:My app has .txt files in subdirectories in the assets folder. It reads those .txt files and puts them in a textview. It's working great and no problems.

Should I be concerned about the files in the assets folder getting deleted by the user or missing. If this ever could happen, my app would get an error because the file would not be there when it tried to read it into the stream.

Is there a need for me to check the existence of an asset file before I read it or does the asset manager take care of it all? I also was wondering if there's a chance that a user would or could delete and asset file.

Like I say, everything works fine without me inserting code to check for file existence. I just wondered if people use the .exists() statement every time they go to read in a stream from assets.

A:Yes and No. 

A normal user would not be able to delete them, but a user on a rooted phone who doesn't know what they're doing\xe2\x80\xa6 that's a different situation.

If you ask me, the extra code is not needed. Also if you try and open a file that doesn't exist, you will get an exception thrown at some point, catch that and display a dialog if you really want to.
