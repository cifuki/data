Q:I understand that these properties in the manifest:

android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar"     
android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"


can remove the title bar.
However, I constantly check the Graphical Layout when I am modifying my app. When I look at the Graphical Layout I still see the title bar. I want to remove the title bar in a way that I don't have to see it during the development of the game.
