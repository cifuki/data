Q:I've got a clean Android project with Google Play services rev. 13 installed through the SDK manager, following these instructions.

My build.gradle file is as follows:

dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.0.30'
}


However, when I attempt to build this app, I get 

Gradle: A problem occurred configuring project ':Maple'.
> Failed to notify project evaluation listener.
   > Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':Maple:_DebugCompile'.
      > Could not find com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.0.30.
