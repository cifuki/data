Q:As regards to expandable list view, the group icon indicator is positioned to the left side, can I move the indicator and positioned it to the right? Thanks.

EDITED: Since I don't want to extend the view, I got this workaround of getting the width dynamically. Just sharing my solution.


Display newDisplay = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay(); 
int width = newDisplay.getWidth();
newListView.setIndicatorBounds(width-50, width);

A:According to ExpandableListView's source code, the only way to move an indicator to the right side is to change its bounds using ExpandableListView.setIndicatorBounds() method. You can calculate bound in onSizeChanged() method, for example.
