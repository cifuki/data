A:A. If you can use startActivityForResult

As per Zain Ali's answer below: If you can start Activity with startActivityForResult()  then you can get name of calling Activity class by this.getCallingActivity().getClassName();

B. If you can not use startActivityForResult 

If you can not use startActivityForResult(), then you can use following method: 
You can pass additional parameter in intent, check the value in activity and act accordingly.

1)  Define an interface or constants class to define integer constants to indicate calling activity

public interface ActivityConstants {
            public static final int ACTIVITY_1 = 1001;
            public static final int ACTIVITY_2 = 1002;
            public static final int ACTIVITY_3 = 1003;
}


2)  Add extra parameter in intent while calling Activity2.

        Intent act2 = new Intent(context, Activity2.class);
                act2.putExtra("calling-activity", ActivityConstants.ACTIVITY_1);
    // or ActivityConstants.ACTIVITY_3 if called form Activity3
startActivity(act2);


3)  Check the value of this extra parameter in Activity2 and act accordingly..

int callingActivity = getIntent().getIntExtra("calling-activity", 0);

        switch (callingActivity) {
        case ActivityConstants.ACTIVITY_1:
            // Activity2 is started from Activity1
            break;
        case ActivityConstants.ACTIVITY_3:
            // Activity2 is started from Activity3
            break;
        }
