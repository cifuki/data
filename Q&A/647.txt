A:Open the application package for Android Studio in finder, and edit the Info.plist file. Change the key JVMversion. Put 1.6+ instead of 1.6*. That worked for me!.

Cheers!

Edited:

While this was necessary in older versions of Android Studio, this is no longer recommended. See the official statement 

"Please note: Do not edit Info.plist to pick a different version. That will break not only the application signature, but also future patch updates to your installation." 

Antonio Jose's answer is the correct one.

Thanks aried3r!
