Q:I have one Application class to keep the global state of my application. But I'm unable to register it in Manifest file? Any idea how to do this?

A:If it derives from Application, add the fully qualified (namespace + class name) as the android:name parameter of the application element in your manifest.

<application
        android:name="com.you.yourapp.ApplicationEx"


Or if the class' package can be described as relative to the package in the manifest tag, then just start with a .:

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          package="com.you.yourapp">

    <application
        android:name=".ApplicationEx"
