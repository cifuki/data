Q:I am trying to sign my apk file. I can't figure out how to do it. I can't find good in-depth directions. I have very little programing experience, so any help would be appreciated.

A:The manual is clear enough. Please specify what part you get stuck with after you work through it, I'd suggest:

https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html

Okay, a small overview without reference or eclipse around, so leave some space for errors, but it works like this


Open your project in eclipse
Press right-mouse - > tools (android tools?) - > export signed application (apk?)
Go through the wizard:
Make a new key-store. remember that password
Sign your app
Save it etc.


Also, from the link:


  Compile and sign with Eclipse ADT
  
  If you are using Eclipse with the ADT
  plugin, you can use the Export Wizard
  to export a signed .apk (and even
  create a new keystore, if necessary).
  The Export Wizard performs all the
  interaction with the Keytool and
  Jarsigner for you, which allows you to
  sign the package using a GUI instead
  of performing the manual procedures to
  compile, sign, and align, as discussed
  above. Once the wizard has compiled
  and signed your package, it will also
  perform package alignment with
  zip align. Because the Export Wizard
  uses both Keytool and Jarsigner, you
  should ensure that they are accessible
  on your computer, as described above
  in the Basic Setup for Signing.
  
  To create a signed and aligned .apk in
  Eclipse:
  
  
  Select the project in the Package Explorer and select File >
  Export.
  Open the Android folder, select Export Android Application, and click
  Next.
  
  The Export Android Application wizard now starts, which will guide
  you through the process of signing
  your application, including steps for
  selecting the private key with which
  to sign the .apk (or creating a new
  keystore and private key).
  Complete the Export Wizard and your application will be compiled,
  signed, aligned, and ready for
  distribution.
