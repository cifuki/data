Q:I want to use an elevation in a custom layout element and I want to set in XML the value of that element using the default action bar elevation value. I can't find a way to get it in XML and I'd like to avoid to call getElevation() in code. Any tips?

A:Default value is 8dp, create dimen with this value and use on whole project, I got it from sources, but the material design guidelines state the action bar elevation should be 4dp.
