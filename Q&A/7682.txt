Q:I have wasted a whole day trying out different solutions floating around in SO and other place mentioned to enable wifi on the android emulator but to no avail.
Can anybody help me figure out how do I enable internet on my android emulator?

I have Nexus 5X API 27 and target being Android 8.1 (Google Play)
and Nexus 5 API P and target being Android 7.1.1.

I believe there should be a way to enable internet on it or else the whole point of providing virtual wifi on the emulator seems to be waste.

I am on mac OS HS 10.13.4 directly connected to my router with no proxy.

I even tried deleting all the AVDs, re-installing them. I even tried having installed the latest Pixel 2 with Oreo Android 8.1

Nothing seems to be working. Has anybody faced this issue and found a solution?

Any help would be of great help

Thanks, 
Vikram

Update: When I connect my computer through my phone as hotspot wifi, the emulator has internet through wifi, but it fails when I connect my computer to my home router.

A:Stated below are the solutions for Windows and Mac, but similar solutions will work any OS:


On Windows


Open Network and Sharing Center and click on current Connection
Click on Properties
Double Click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)
Set the Preferred and Alternate DNS servers as (Screenshot below) : 

8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4


On Mac


Go to Settings > Network > Advanced... > DNS 
Delete whatever entries you have there and add these two entries (Screenshot below):

8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4


Note: For Mac users, if the entries field is disabled and you're not able to edit it, click on the 'Lock' icon in the bottom area of that window and enter the password to be able to make changes



Restart the emulator, and it should solve:

Edit: This is the fix for a situation when the emulator's wifi has changed the DNS to something other than 8.8.8.8. While this works most of the time, there might also be other reasons which may not fix from this solution.
