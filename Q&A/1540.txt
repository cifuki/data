Q:I kind of feel stupid, but I just can't get it to work....

I have an existing Android project copied from my other pc, in the folder

c:\\projects\\trunk\\android\\emergency


(I created that project on the other pc, copied it to my new pc and the other pc is given away)
Now I want to open the project in Eclipse. So I THINK I tried everything, but I can't seem to get it to work...

I looked for something like 'open project', but didn't find it.

Then I tried 'import', but that wouldn't let me import it because it was the same workspace (I use the same filelocations and workspace location as on the other pc)

Then i tried creating a new workspace and import it there. Then it complained about have no project, that i first had to create one. So i did create a dummy one in the new workspace, imported the project, and it copied everything to the new workspace, and placed it below the dummy project.

I am SO stuck, can you help me?

Btw, this is the Eclipse i'm using:
Eclipse SDK
Version: 4.2.0
Build id: I20120608-1400

A:Try File > New > Project... > Android Project From Existing Code.
Don't copy your project from pc into workspace, copy it elsewhere and let the eclipse copy it into workspace by menu commands above and checking copy in existing workspace.
