Q:In the documentation on AsyncTask it gives the following as a rule related to threading:


  
  The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if a second execution is attempted.)
  


All this means is that you have to create a new instance of the class every time you want to use it, right? In other words, it must be done like this:

new DownloadFilesTask().execute(url1, url2, url3);
new DownloadFilesTask().execute(url4, url5, url6);


Or conversely, you can NOT do the following:

DownloadFilesTask dfTask = new DownloadFilesTask();
dfTask.execute(url1, url2, url3);
dfTask.execute(url4, url5, url6);


Can someone verify this is an accurate interpretation?

I realize I pretty much just answered this for myself as I was typing this out... But it wasn't immediately obvious to me so I think this would be useful to have posted nonetheless.

That is a very accurate interpretation.
