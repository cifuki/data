Q:I created an AlertDialog:

private CharSequence[] _items = { "item1", "item2", "item3", "item4",
"item5", "item6", "item7" };

AlertDialog.Builder daysBuilder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
    daysBuilder.setTitle("SomeCaption");

    daysBuilder.setMultiChoiceItems(_items,new Boolean[] { false, true, false, 
false false false, true }, SetListener);
    daysBuilder.setPositiveButton("OK", OKListener);
    daysBuilder.setNegativeButton("Cancel", CancelListener);

    AlertDialog alert = daysBuilder.create();
    alert.show();`


Through the statement "new Boolean[] { false, true, false false false false, true }" the items
in the dialog get checked/unchecked by default.

When I open the dialog, change the selection of the items but then dismiss (by pressing cancel or the back-button of the device) the dialog gets dismissed. So far so good.

But when I reopen the dialog, the items have the checked/unchecked state of the previous changes from the last opening of the dialog.

But when the dialog was dismissed at the first opening, I want to have the items checked/unchecked state like when I created the dialog (new Boolean[] { false, true, false false false false, true }).

So basically I need an opportunity to get notified when the dialog gets dissmissed so I can then reset the state of the items.

I tried it with the setOnDismissListener for the dialog object. Unfortunately this is just available in API 17.

setOnDismissListener worked perfect for me (exactly what I need) in the emulator (API 17) but not on my device (Android 4.1 => API 16)

Is there something similar in API 16?

A:The problem is you are using setOnDismissListener of AlertDialog.Builder. This was introduced in Api level 17, setOnDismissListener of AlertDialog itself has been since api level 1.

AlertDialog alert = daysBuilder.create();
alert.setOndismissListener(yourdismisslistener);
alert.show();`
