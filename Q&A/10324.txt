Q:I have an android app that consists of a webview. It needs to allow users to fill in a form on a webpage and then change the data of the form after the user has clicked submit on the form. The form will use the POST request method. 

So my question is, how can I intercept the POST data from the form, change it's values, then send it along?

For example: If there's a web form like this...

<form action="http://www.example.com/do.php" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="submit" />
</form>


If the user enters name = Steve and email = steve@steve.com in the form, I want to change the values to name = bob and email = bob@bob.com in the android app and have the new POST be sent to http://www.example.com/do.php.

Thanks for your help!

A:If you are familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest you use JavaScript. I think it's more convenient and easy. This tour tells you how to use JavaScript in a WebView.
