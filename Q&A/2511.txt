Q:I have a bunch of EditTexts in my Android application, each with InputMethod set to numberSigned. My target device does not have a hardware keyboard and uses the software keyboard for numeric entry. Android replaces the standard "Done" button to the right of the entry box with a "Next" button. How can I use "Done" instead?

A:Try adding android:imeOptions="actionDone" to your EditText.
