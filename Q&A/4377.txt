Q:I have not updated my Android Studio for a while and am presented with this dialog box when trying to update:


Usually there is an "update and restart" option, but not here. The only option is "Download" which directs me here where I can only download the entire bundle again which gives me a link for Build Number - 130.737825. As you can see that's before what I already have so I don't see how that would fix the problem?

I feel like I'm missing something blaringly obvious, but how can I just update like I have been able to before?

A:That means that the current version can not be automatically updated. You should download the new version manually.
