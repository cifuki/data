Q:I have a notification in the status bar for my app:

    Notification notification = new Notification(R.drawable.icon, null, System.currentTimeMillis());

    Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(this.parent, MainActivity.class);
    PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this.parent, 0, notificationIntent, 0);

    ...

    notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_ONGOING_EVENT;        
    mNotificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);


The problem with this is that when you press the home button from the app (pushing it to the background) then press on the notification in the list accessed from the status bar, it starts a fresh copy of the activity. All I want to do is resume the app (like when you longpress the home button and press on the app's icon). Is there a way of creating an Intent to do this?

A:I've solved this issue by changing the launchMode of my activity to singleTask in the androidManifest.xml file. 

The default value for this property is standard, which allows any number of instances to run. 


  "singleTask" and "singleInstance" activities can only begin a task. They are always at the root of the activity stack. Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time \xe2\x80\x94 only one such task. [...]
  
  The "singleTask" and "singleInstance" modes also differ from each other in only one respect: A "singleTask" activity allows other activities to be part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but other activities (necessarily "standard" and "singleTop" activities) can be launched into that task. A "singleInstance" activity, on the other hand, permits no other activities to be part of its task. It's the only activity in the task. If it starts another activity, that activity is assigned to a different task \xe2\x80\x94 as if FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK was in the intent. 


you can find a detailed explanation in the Android Developers' Guide

I hope this helps
