Q:Upgraded to Studio Canary build. My previous project of Telegram Messenger is giving following error.


  Error:All flavors must now belong to a named flavor dimension. The flavor 'armv7' is not assigned to a flavor dimension. Learn more at https://d.android.com/r/tools/flavorDimensions-missing-error-message.html


What should I do? I have already seen that link but couldn't understand what to do. I have 3 build variants now, release,debug and foss.

A:If you don't really need the mechanism, just specify a random flavor dimension in your build.gradle:

android { 
    ...
    flavorDimensions "default"
    ...
}
