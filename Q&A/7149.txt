Q:I'm finding that in my application, the user can get quite 'nested' in the various activities that are opened while the user is using the application.

For example:


Main Menu
Object List
Object Details
Object Edit
Object Details
Object Child Details
Object Child Edit
Object Child Details


Now, when the user presses back, it has to go through 'Object Child Details' twice (same object, when it is edited it returns to the detailed page), and the same thing happens for the 'Parent Object Details'.

Is there a way to reuse activities, if they are already open in the stack, and reorder them to the front? The only way I have seen is on activities with the launcher attribute. I believe I saw singleTask and singleTop.

If am supposed to be using these two attributes, singleTask and singleTop, how am I supposed to use them? When I tried to include them in the application, it made no difference. Do I also need to set a flag while launching the intent using startActivity?

A:in Manifest Activity property you can give this parameter android:launchMode="singleInstance"
