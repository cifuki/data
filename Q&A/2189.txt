Q:Since a couple of days it's possible to use in-app-billing in Android apps. Very cool of course. So, I started working on a update for my application to implement this. But now I run into some problems. This is what I did:


I first tried the reserved product IDs for testing static in-app 
billing responses. That works without problems.
I uploaded a draft APK to the market (with production signing, no debug signing), that included the com.android.vending.BILLING permission.
When I did that I was able to add a 'In-app Products' to my app in the market and set it status to published. 
I created a test user and reseted my device to make that test user the primary account on my test device. 
The reserved product id's still work.


Now comes the problem. When I use my own product ID (the one I added before, see above) a dialog is shown with the following text: 

"Application Error : This version of the application is not configured for Market Billing. Check the help center for more information."

There is nothing strange I can find in the log. Anyone knows what I'm doing wrong here?

A:I just encountered this issue and realized it was because I was running a debug, unsigned version of my app. In Eclipse, when I exported and signed my application and installed it on the phone, then I was able to use my in-app products without seeing this error message.
