Q:I have an app that makes extensive use of a WebView. When the user of this app does not have Internet connection, a page saying "web page not available" and various other text appears. Is there a way to not show this generic text in my WebView? I would like to provide my own error handling. 

private final Activity activity = this;

private class MyWebViewClient extends WebViewClient
 public void onReceivedError(WebView view, int errorCode, String description, String failingUrl) {
  // I need to do something like this:
  activity.webView.wipeOutThePage();
  activity.myCustomErrorHandling();
  Toast.makeText(activity, description, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
 }
}


I found out WebView->clearView doesn't actually clear the view.

A:First create your own error page in HTML and put it in your assets folder, Let's call it myerrorpage.html
Then with onReceivedError:

mWebView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
    public void onReceivedError(WebView view, int errorCode, String description, String failingUrl) {
        mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/myerrorpage.html");

    }
});
