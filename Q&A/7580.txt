Q:Im new to android development
my app gets constantly killed when switching 11 times from activity and than it only says  


  Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -6 in tid 9485 (Thread-141585)


in my logcat.

What does this mean?

A:Without more details (like seeing some code).

1) Do not block the UI thread, this can cause a SIGABRT as the OS will kill a non-responsive app.


  bind and unbind on every activity when i switch for like 11 times it crashes my app


2)  Make sure that in your OnDestroy within your Activity you are cleaning up after yourself. i.e. Removing all your Listeners/Events and then calling the Base.OnDestory. 

3) An external (i.e. BluetoothLeService) service calling back into your app with listeners that now null/nil will cause hangs and thus a SIGABRT, see #2
