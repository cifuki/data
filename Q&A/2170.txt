Q:How can I get the margin value of a View from an Activity? The View can be of any type. 

After a bit of searching I found out ways to get padding of a view, but couldn't find anything on Margin. Can anyone help?

I tried something like this,

ViewGroup.LayoutParams vlp = view.getLayoutParams();
int marginBottom = ((LinearLayout.LayoutParams) vlp).bottomMargin;


This works, but in the above code I have assumed the view to be a LinearLayout. But I need to get the margin attribute even when I don't know the view type.

A:try this:

View view = findViewById(...) //or however you need it
LayoutParams lp = (LayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams();


margins are accessible via

lp.leftMargin;
lp.rightMargin;
lp.topMargin;
lp.bottomMargin;


edit:
perhaps ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams will work for you. It's a base class for other LayoutParams.

ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams lp = (ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams();
