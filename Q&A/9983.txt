Q:I updated my ADT to the latest version after Gingerbread was released. And now

<string name="date_format">%d:%d %s</string>


shows the following error

Multiple annotations found at this line:
- error: Multiple substitutions specified in non-positional format; did you mean to add the formatted="false" 
 attribute?
- error: Unexpected end tag string


Previous ADT version worked fine. Am I doing something wrong? I get this error whenever there are more than 1 format specifiers.
