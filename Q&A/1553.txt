Q:I have tried to update my Eclipse. Currently I have till 2.2 Android SDK in my Eclipse. Yesterday I have updated my Eclipse like this:

Eclipse -> window -> Android SDK Manager -> I have checked two check-boxes from list. Tools -> Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Platform Tools.

I have posted here some last lines of the message which I get from downloading and installing:

But after all this after I have closed Eclipse and again wanted to start, it throw the error:


  This Android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 20.0.0 or above. Current version is 16.0.0.v201203301601-306762. Please update ADT to the latest version.


In preferences I received this error:


  This Android SDK requires Android Develop... Please update ADT to the latest version.

A:You have updated the android sdk but not updated the adt to match with it. 

You can update the adt from here

You might need to update the software source for your adt update

Go to eclipse > help > Check for updates.

It should list the latest update of adt. If it is not working try the same *Go to eclipse > help > Install new software * but now please do the follwing:


Click on add
Add this url : https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
Give it any name.


It will list the updates available-  which should ideally be adt 20.xx

Eclipse will restart and hopefully everything should work fine for you.
