Q:I find it very hard to get any consolidating information about which Android phones do have a gyroscope, or if there are Android phones with this sensor at all. I read about some (especially Samsung) phone models that have at least a 6-axis accelerometer, but I also read that this is different to a real gyroscope.

So my questions are:


Which Android phones do have a gyroscope? (Should be usable with the Android API's Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE which is available since API 3)
Which Android phones do have a 6-axis accelerometer?


Any references like links, specs etc. are greatly appreciated and of course will be rewarded. :-)

Thanks for your help!

A:Since I have recently developed an Android application using gyroscope data (steady compass), I tried to collect a list with such devices. This is not an exhaustive list at all, but it is what I have so far:

*** Phones:


HTC Sensation
HTC Sensation XL
HTC Evo 3D
HTC One S
HTC One X
Huawei Ascend P1
Huawei Ascend X (U9000)
Huawei Honor (U8860)
LG Nitro HD (P930)
LG Optimus 2x (P990)
LG Optimus Black (P970)
LG Optimus 3D (P920)
Samsung Galaxy S II (i9100)
Samsung Galaxy S III (i9300)
Samsung Galaxy R (i9103)
Samsung Google Nexus S (i9020)
Samsung Galaxy Nexus (i9250)
Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) model 
Samsung Galaxy Note (n7000)

Sony Xperia S (LT26i)


*** Tablets:


Acer Iconia Tab A100 (7")
Acer Iconia Tab A500 (10.1")

Hope the list keeps growing and hope that gyros will be soon available on mid and low price smartphones.
