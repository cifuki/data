Q:I have defined some product flavors in my build.gradle. I am able to successfully build them using gradlew. 

I can't figure out how I do so from the Android Studio IDE. 

(My project was initially done in Eclipse then I've migrated to the Android Studio)

A:Build Variants appears as a vertical button along the bottom of the left edge of the workspace. If it's not visible, click the little rectangle icon on the lower left corner.
