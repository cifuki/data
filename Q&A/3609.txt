Q:Im creating an app where users need to walk to a point on a map. But they need to find a route to the point by them selves.
Ive created a map with markers but by default if a user clicks on the marker a "start navigation" and "view in google maps" option is shown. Is it possible to disable these options ?



The options that are shown on marker click

A:This thing is called Map Toolbar. You can disable it by calling  UiSettings.setMapToolbarEnabled(false):

GoogleMap map;
....... //init map

map.getUiSettings().setMapToolbarEnabled(false);
