Q:I'm trying to simply write a simple XML file to the SD card and I noticed that my Nexus 4 does write the file, but it is not viewable via the MTP protocol using Windows 7.

code:

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    CustomerQueryRqType customerQueryRequest = new CustomerQueryRqType();
    Serializer serializer = new Persister();
    File myFile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/customerQueryRequest.xml");

    try {
        boolean created = myFile.createNewFile();
        serializer.write(customerQueryRequest, myFile);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}


I can see the file on the phone itself with Astro File Manager:



but Windows doesn't see it...:



adb shell on the directory shows:

What's going on with my Nexus 4?  Why is it hiding my things from Windows?

A:Seems to be a known issue affecting Android USB file access over MTP.  The MTP cache gets out of date until a reboot of the phone.

A workaround is:


Clear the "Media Storage" app's data
Use the SDrescan or the SD Scanner (also works on Android 4.4/5, available on F-Droid) app to force an update 


Or just avoid using USB at all.  The issue does not affect other methods of accessing the files.  For example, try AirDroid to transfer files.



Note: This doesn't work for Android 5.0.2: After clearing "Media Storage" and using an SD Rescanner, the folders appears in Windows 7 as unopenable 4K files. The only solution at that point is to clear once again Media Storage and restart the device
