Q:public static final TAG = "Legendry Eagle";


Issue:  I want to see logs of "Legendry Eagle" from the commandline.

I tried:

 adb logcat -s "Legendry Eagle" 
 adb logcat -s <Legendry Eagle>


But Still it is not working.

A:If you only want to show logcat for a specific TAG, do it like this:

adb logcat YourTAGHere:Priority *:S


The *:S is important, as it sets all other tags to silent. If I want to track only my MainActivity tag at Verbose level, the syntax would look like this.

adb logcat MainActivity:V *:S


Edit:
I found no good way of filtering out tags with spaces. LegendryEagle works fine, but I was not able to filter out Legendry Eagle
