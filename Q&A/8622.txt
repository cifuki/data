Q:I have set up a Chosen plugin for a select field for the user to be able to type-search from a long list.

Although I am developing this for mobile phones and while it works fine on computer, it is disabled on both Apple and Android phones and the default user interface pops up for the select input.

I'd like to use the plugin on phones.

A:Before using any plugin, try checking its scope.

Chosen is not supported on android or IOS, "Chosen is disabled on iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android mobile devices "
