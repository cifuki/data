Q:After several searches online, I couldn't find a place that could tell me every existent mime type for different types of media in android applications.

Here are the ones I know that exist and work:

For Text

"text/plain"


For Image

"image/jpeg"
"image/bmp"
"image/gif"
"image/jpg"
"image/png"


For Video

"video/wav"
"video/mp4"


These are the ones I have and know that work, I am lacking several for video and sound type files. Does anyone know a place where every android mime-type is described or do you guys ever used another mime-type for these different types of media?

EDIT:

I am using this in an application that monitors sms and mms and in the mms type manages the content inside it. The code i have runs for every version above 8.

MediaStore supported MIME type is here: http://androidxref.com/4.4.4_r1/xref/frameworks/base/media/java/android/media/MediaFile.java#174
And there is also a API URLConnection.getFileNameMap()

And its inner side is here: http://androidxref.com/4.4.4_r1/xref/libcore/luni/src/main/java/libcore/net/MimeUtils.java
