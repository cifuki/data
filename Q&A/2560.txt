Q:I want to use select query for retrieving data from table. I have found, rawQuery(query, selectionArgs) method of SQLiteDatabase class to retrieve data. But I don't know how the query and selectionArgs should be passed to rawQuery method?

You pass a string array with an equal number of elements as you have "?"
