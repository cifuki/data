Q:Currently there is no default implementation of RecyclerView.Adapter available.
  
  May be with the official release, Google will add it.


Since there is no support for CursorAdapter with the RecyclerView currently, how can we use a RecyclerView with a database ? Any suggestions ?

A:If you are running a query with a CursorLoader and you want RecyclerView instead of ListView. 

You can try my CursorRecyclerViewAdapter: CursorAdapter in RecyclerView
