Q:I am trying to connect a Moto G Mobile to Eclipse in My Windows 7 32-bit machine but It doesn't show on the devices List. For this, First I connected the device to machine via USB cable and then I chose the PTP mode and then I checked the "USB debugging" option in devices settings. After a few seconds it says "Drivers was installed Unsuccessfully". At that time, I had uninstalled the device drivers in the device manager of my machine and then disconnected and connected again. It said "Drivers was installed successfully" and then I updated the drivers in the device manager and then set the drivers(google-drivers from SDK).But it doesn't show in the devices List. what did I do wrong here?

Download 'Adb Driver Installer' from here http://adbdriver.com/downloads/

after this connect your Moto G and start the AdbDriverInstaller.exe it will list your device and then press install.

Hope it Works !
