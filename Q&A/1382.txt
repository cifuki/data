Q:I have a little problem.

The Problem:
I am trying to build a gradle of my Android Project on Jenkins and now I am standing on this problem i can't resolve. 
During the Building I have this Error message:

:Client:mergeDebugResources
/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/LMA-Client/Client/build/exploded-aar/com.google.android.gms/play-services/3.1.59/res/drawable-hdpi/common_signin_btn_text_focus_light.9.png: 
Error: Cannot run program "/opt/android-sdk/build-tools/19.0.1/aapt": java.io.IOException: error=2, No such file or directory
:Client:mergeDebugResources FAILED


You can imagine that this aapt... yep its there and the png... its there too, so the mistake must be somewhere else.

The Solution?
Now I googled 1-2 hours around, surfed on this great Website and what I found is that if Jenkins runs on a 64-bit system, I need to install the ia32-libs. Like that:

sudo apt-get install ia32-libs


now I tried that, and I couldn't install it:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ia32-libs : Depends: ia32-libs-multiarch


so I tried to install "ia32-libs-multiarch", but again:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ia32-libs-multiarch:i386 : Depends: libgphoto2-2:i386 but it is not going to be installed
                            Depends: libsane:i386 but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.


Finally
so finally im standing here and asking me: is that really the solution? And why should I install this thing? And how? So please help me, I think I am not far away from the answer.

A:I had the following similar error on Ubuntu 13.10:

Cannot run program "/usr/local/android-sdk-linux/build-tools/19.0.3/aapt": error=2, No such file or directory

And this answer fixed it for me:


  To get aapt working (this fixed my issues with the avd as well) just install these two packages:

sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1
