Q:We got a NumberPicker widget in 3.0, but it seems that the textSize for this widget can't be modified. Am I missing something or is this the case? I'd really like to increase the font size, it's quite small with the default value. But I can't see a textSize property for it.

A:We ran into the same problem and ended up recreating NumberPicker locally. There's a more in depth tutorial here.
