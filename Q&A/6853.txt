Solutions:

I used following code to get the desired value

long dv = Long.valueOf(timestamp_in_string)*1000;// its need to be in milisecond
Date df = new java.util.Date(dv);
String vv = new SimpleDateFormat("MM dd, yyyy hh:mma").format(df);

A:You can use new java.util.Date(Long.parseLong(timeInMillis)). With this Date object there are several ways to extract the date in your desired String format, the simplest way using Date.toString(). Alternatively, and more appropriately you can use a SimpleDateFormat with the exact pattern you want.
