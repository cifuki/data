Q:While configuring MJAndriod I have got an error as follows:

Project has no default.properties file! Edit the project properties to set one.


I have a default.properties which us set to a perfect target and works for another application in the same workspace.

Kindly help me resolve this.

A:If the project already contains a file default.properties you can open that file and edit+save it (add a space, save, remove that space, save). That worked for me.

A note with the above discussion:


  R.java is getting generated automatically by doing the above described process. When I go and remove it, it gets generated again. Neither is it allowing me to edited the automatically generated one. \xe2\x80\x93 Compuser7


With respect to the comment quoted above, R.java is indeed an automatically generated class that contains references to all the resources (in the res folder) that belong with your project.

When Eclipse rebuilds, this file is regenerated, since most application (I mean Java code) rely on the fact that there are some resources (images, layouts and string values) available. When you remove the file R.java through Eclipse, Eclipse will see this change in the project as a reason to automatically rebuild (see the options under Project) the project, regenerating the R.java file.

So DON'T try to remove R.java, because Eclipse will regenerate it as soon as you rebuild the project, which will result in a match of patience ;)
