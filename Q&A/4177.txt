  ADB dosn't recognize my Galaxy Nexus - Win7  




I'm not seeing my Nexus7 listed in Eclipse's DDMS Devices.

DDMS and "adb devices" from the console show my G1 android phone, but not the Nexus7.

Usb Debugging is enabled on both phones, Eclipse is up to date as far as I can tell, Android SDK's Google-USB-rev6

When I plugged in the N7 USB, I did see the Windows7 driver installed, and can browse files on it from file manager.

MTP/PTP made no difference (MTP drivers from Microsoft Update, none for PTP)

"Select debug app" in Developer Options shows nothing.

"Unknown sources" is checked.

Tried different Usb port, toggled Usb Debugging.

A:Heres what I did to get it working:


I happened to already have ADB drivers for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus installed, if you don't, you need to download those.
Plug in the Nexus 7 and windows will find 2 drivers automatically, but won't find any for "Nexus"
Go to Device Manager, under "Other Devices" you'll see "Nexus" with the yellow exclamation mark, Right Click>Upate Drivers>Let me choose>Let me pick form device drivers on my computer.
Scroll down to "SAMSUNG Android Phone" (Again, the Galaxy Nexus drivers should be installed already, if not, find them), and choose the driver for "Android ADB Interface"
Click "Next", and the device should pop up in Eclipse.


It worked for me, at least.
