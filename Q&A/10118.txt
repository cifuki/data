Q:I have noticed some Google Play app links in the browser has the referrer= attribute to them, which obviously tells the referrer that sent you to that app's page in Google Play.

Is it possible to see that referrer (if any) in the code of my app? And if not, to see it anywhere at all?

A:You can use com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER. 


  The Google Play com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER Intent is
  broadcast when an app is installed from the Google Play Store.


Add this receiver to AndroidManifest.xml    

<receiver
    android:name="com.example.android.InstallReferrerReceiver"
    android:exported="true"
    android:permission="android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>


Create a BroadcastReceiver:

public class InstallReferrerReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        String referrer = intent.getStringExtra("referrer");

        //Use the referrer
    }
}


You can test the referral tracking following the steps of this answer.
