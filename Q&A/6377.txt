Q:I'm using Eclipse + the Android SDK on a Mac running Snow Leopard to develop Android apps.

Thing is, Eclipse is really slow - like, it "beach balls" for a few seconds when changing tabs.

Is there anything I can do to improve it's performance?

A:The solution: change the Java version used and increase the allocated memory.

Edit eclipse.ini - this file is located Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini.

Change the following vars to use Java 1.6 and allocate more memory:

-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion = 1.6
-Xms128m
-Xmx1024m
