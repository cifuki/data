A:Start Activity2 with startActivityForResult and use setResult method for sending data back from Activity2 to Activity1. In Activity1 you will need to override onActivityResult for updating TextView with EditText data from Activity2.

For example:

In Activity1, start Activity2 as:

Intent i = new Intent(this, Activity2.class);
startActivityForResult(i, 1);


In Activity2, use setResult for sending data back:

Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.putExtra("editTextValue", "value_here")
setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);        
finish();


And in Activity1, receive data with onActivityResult:

public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == 1) {
         if(resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
             String strEditText = data.getStringExtra("editTextValue");
         }     
    }
} 


If you can, also use SharedPreferences for sharing data between Activities.
