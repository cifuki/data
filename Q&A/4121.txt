Q:I'm really having troubles with the Facebook hash key.
I generated it in my Eclipse.. proof:


Then I went to https://developers.facebook.com/ and registered a new app.



And finally I've set my hashkey at the settings of Facebook developers:


But no whatter I do I keep getting the same error log:
"Key hash B5dWUEYfZJL/...........jyA= does not match any stored key hashes"

Does anybody know what I did wrong or how I can fix this problem?
If I used the id and name from the HelloFacebookSample inside my own app everything works.
So it HAS to do with the key hash, id or name I've set somewhere most likely..

Thank you,
Yenthe

A:If your login is working without installing facebook app and not working when facebook app is installed due to error "hash key has not match" then do following steps 

1 ) Launch your app and try to log in with facebook. A dialog will open and tell you: "the key has not been found in the facebook developer console and also show the hash key.

2 ) Note down that hash key.

3 ) Put it into your facebook developer console where you first generated your api key and remove the hash key with new and save. Now you are done. Anyone that downloads your app, published with earlier used keystore can log into facebook.
