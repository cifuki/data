A:BaseAdapter as the name suggests, is a base class for all the adapters.

When you are extending the Base adapter class you need to implement all the methods like getCount(), getId() etc.

ArrayAdapter is a class which can work with array of data. You need to override only getview() method.

ListAdapter is a an interface implemented by concrete adapter classes.

BaseAdapter is an abstract class whereas ArrayAdapter and ListAdapter are the concrete classes.

ArrayAdapter and ListAdapter classes are developed since in general we deal with the array data sets and list data sets.
