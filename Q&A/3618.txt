Q:I have looked at the documentation for android.util.Log and I'm not sure exactly what the difference between Log.e() and Log.wtf() is. Is one preferred over the other? Is there a functionality difference? Surely they aren't redundant.

Note to future readers: At the time this question was asked, the documentation for this was much less clear. If you follow the link above, they have fixed the problem.

A:There is a difference in severity;

Log.e() will simply log an error to the log with priority ERROR.

Log.wtf() will log an error with priority level ASSERT, and may (depending on the system configuration) send an error report and terminate the program immediately.
