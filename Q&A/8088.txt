Q:I am somewhat confused, I noticed that upon setting up my first Git repository in Android Studio all of the correct files to ignore were automatically added to the Project's Settings under Settings > Version Control > Ignored Files.

This appeared to be magic, I never told it what to ignore. Moreover, there is no .gitignore file in any directory of my project as I'm used to creating.

This being said, I can't get my second project to automatically add ignored files, and really, I just want to use the simple .gitignore method.

Does anyone know how to override Android Studio's ignored files list and simply use a .gitignore instead? I'd like the ease of copying my .gitignore to all other projects I make, it does not appear you can copy Settings > Version Control > Ignored Files.

Thank you for commenting on how I can just use .gitignore.

A:Ok to answer my own question. To go back to using .gitignore, do the following:


Go to Settings > Version Control > Ignored Files and remove all ignored files. Hit Apply.
Still in Settings > Version Control change the type of version control from Git to none. Hit Apply.
Delete the project's .git directory created previously.
Create the following .gitignore file in the root directory of your project:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/21049338/459095
VCS > Enable Version Control... to Re-enable Git.
Then right click on the project root and select Git > Add to add the entire project.


Doing the above will utilize the .gitignore file instead of Settings > Version Control > Ignored Files to commit the right files.
