Q:I want to compile the following library in my project in build.gradle:

https://github.com/theDazzler/Android-Bootstrap

It is forked from https://github.com/Bearded-Hen/Android-Bootstrap, but no documentation in the repository explains how to include in in project.

I tried something like this:

compile 'com.theDazzler:androidbootstrap:+'


but gradle failed and shows error that library not found.

Edit: Can anyone fork it and/or publish it?

A:This fork isn't published in the maven central repo.

Then you can't use an import like compile com.theDazzler:androidbootstrap:+

You have to:
- clone this library locally as a module in your project
Clone the 
https://github.com/theDazzler/Android-Bootstrap/tree/master/AndroidBootstrap folder in your root/module1 folder.

  root:
      module1
        build.gradle
      app
        build.gradle
      settings.gradle



Change your settings.gradle file in 

include ':module1'
include ':app'


In your app/build.gradle file you have to add:

dependencies {
    // Module Library
    compile project(':module1')
}


Finally in your module1/build.gradle you have to check the level used for gradle plugin.

EDIT 31/10/2015:

You can use another way to add a dependency with a github project,using the github repo and the jitpack plugin
In this case you have to add this repo tp your build.gradle

repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }


and the dependency:

dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.User:Repo:Tag'
    }
