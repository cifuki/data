Q:Background

I have an app with Admob SDK used in it, to show Interstitial ads (full screen ads).

Reccently Google has updated the SDK, along with many other things (build tools, gradle plugin, IDE, etc...), including admob (firebase ads).

compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-ads:11.4.2'


The problem

After updating, I noticed that whenever the app tries to show an Interstitial ad, it crashes.

The crash log is as such:

10-28 14:01:01.394 4523-4523/... I/Ads: Ad opening.

Thing is that it worked fine before. Now I'm not sure what causes it to occur.

Searching the web, I didn't see anything that talks about "Only fullscreen activities can request orientation" . 

What I had in the manifest, is something a bit old, that might not be needed anymore:

    <activity
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.AdActivity"
        android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize"
        android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent"/>


I say it's probably not needed, because i can't see it anymore in the tutorials, even though I remember I did in the past:


https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start
https://developers.google.com/admob/android/interstitial


What I've tried


I tried to remove the manifest entry. Still same issue.
I tried to set the theme to be "@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen" by force, but it also didn't help.
I even thought that it might be because I currently have Android 8.1, but when I tried using the app from the play store, I noticed it worked just fine, without crashes.
I tried to go back to as far as version 11.2.2 of admob and use gradle v 2.3.3 , but it also didn't help.
When trying on an emulator with Android 7.0 , it worked fine with latest versions of everything, and removal of the whole manifest activity tag.
I tried to use this in gradle file, instead of what I used :

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:11.4.2' 


Still crashed on my device (Nexus 5x with Android 8.1) yet didn't crash on emulator.


Finally, I tried to run the app on emulator with Android 8.1, and it crashed just as on the real device. 
Reported about this to Google Admob team, as well as Android issue tracker. I hope they will answer me about this.


The questions

What could be the cause to this issue?

Is it because of Android 8.1 ? If so, how come the older version of the app worked fine? I tried to revert there a lot of versions to old ones, yet it still crashed.

And, most importantly, how can I solve it?

A:It seems that upgrading to:

com.google.firebase:firebase-ads:15.0.1


solved this issue for me. I've just tested it on Nexus 5X with 8.1.0 and Interstitial Admob ads work now.

More complete solution:

app's build.gradle:

...

android {
    compileSdkVersion 27
    buildToolsVersion '27.0.3'

    defaultConfig {
        ...

        targetSdkVersion 27

        ..
    }
}

dependencies {
    ...

    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-core:15.0.2'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-ads:15.0.1'

    ...
}
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'


top level build.gradle:

buildscript {
    ...

    dependencies {
        ...

        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.3.0'

        ...
    }
}

...
