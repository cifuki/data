Q:I have one of the new MapFragments in a ScrollView. Actually it's a SupportMapFragment, but anyway. It works, but there are two problems:


When scrolled, it leaves a black mask behind. The black covers exactly the area where the map was, except for a hole where the +/- zoom buttons were. See screenshot below. This is on Android 4.0.
The view doesn't use requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent() when the user interacts with the map to prevent the ScrollView intercepting touches, so if you try to pan vertically in the map, it just scrolls the containing ScrollView. I could theoretically derive a view class MapView and add that functionality, but how can I get MapFragment to use my customised MapView instead of the standard one?

A:Applying a transparent image over the mapview fragment seems to resolve the issue.  It's not the prettiest, but it seems to work.   Here's an XML snippet that shows this:

<RelativeLayout
        android:id="@+id/relativeLayout1"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="300dp" >

        <fragment
            android:id="@+id/map"
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="fill_parent"/>

        <ImageView
            android:id="@+id/imageView123"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:src="@drawable/temp_transparent" />         
</RelativeLayout>
