Q:I have this problem, see the trace stack: 

E/AndroidRuntime(2410): Caused by: org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException: Binary XML file line #5: <bitmap> requires a valid src attribute


My xml file looks like:

<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
    <item>
        <bitmap android:src="@drawable/btn_1"/>
    </item>
</layer-list>


btn_1 is another xml file in drawable resources
When i'm using an image(*.png) instead of xml drawable it's ok.

Can I use a drawable resource as src to bitmap?
Just in case here is my btn_1.xml file. It doesn't work even if btn_1 file have no items.

<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
<item android:drawable="@drawable/btn_arrow_bg_red"/>
<item>
    <bitmap
        android:gravity="center"
        android:src="@drawable/btn_arrow_white" />
</item>
</layer-list>

A:You cant have an xml drawable as source for bitmap. Because for example if it was possible, then it could mistakenly create a black-hole by calling xml to itself.

Lets suppose, you have an xml drawable A which has a bitmap whos source is drawable B. But in drawable B, it has a bitmap whos source is drawable A. This will create a circular loop which cant be resolved. That is why you need to provide an image as a source for bitmap to avoid any confusion
