Q:I wonder if it has any meaning to call super.onPostExecute(result) or super.onPreExecute in Android AsyncTask? 
I have been always calling them, but even in Android documentation about AsyncTask (Android API Reference: AsyncTask) they are omitted. 
So does it make any sense if I call them or not?

A:No, there is no need to call the superclass. If you take a look at the AsyncTask source, you will see that the super class does nothing:

@SuppressWarnings({"UnusedDeclaration"})
protected void onPostExecute(Result result) {
}
