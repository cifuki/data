Q:I have an application that opens a url in a webview, the user must then login to a site through the webview and receives a cookie once logged in. I'm having problems getting cookies after login.

The problem is, I can achieve this using android.webkit.CookieManager, and output all cookies in a single string.

However, I want to achieve it using the a cookie store (as in java.net.CookieStore) so I need to be using java.net.CookieManager.

I'm using the following code within the onPageFinished() of a WebViewClient. I know the issue is with opening a new connection, where I need to be getting the content from the current page. I'd appreciate some help, thanks

        @Override
        public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url){

            Log.d(TAG, "Finished loading: " + url);

            CookieSyncManager syncManager = CookieSyncManager.createInstance(Main.this);
            syncManager.sync();

            CookieManager manager = new CookieManager();
            manager.setCookiePolicy(CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL);
            CookieHandler.setDefault(manager);

            try {
                URL blah = new URL(url);
                HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) blah.openConnection();
                readStream(con.getInputStream()); // outputting html
            } 
            catch (Exception e) {
            }

            CookieStore cookieJar = manager.getCookieStore();
            List<HttpCookie> cookies = cookieJar.getCookies();

            for (HttpCookie cookie: cookies) {
                Log.d(TAG, "cookie name : "+cookie.getName().toString());
            }
        }

A:You can extract all cookies current url by this way from webview as string:

@Override
public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url){
    String cookies = CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(url);
    Log.d(TAG, "All the cookies in a string:" + cookies);
}
