Q:I have created a new android project. I want to have a action bar at the top so I downloaded the Action Bar for Android Library because I want to support devices from android 2.1.

The description says


  The action bar component is an Library Project. This means that there's no need to 
  copy-paste resources into your own project, simply
  add the action bar component as a reference to any project.


I am new to android so what does this mean? How can I add the library to my existing project?

Import the library into your eclipse workspace:


File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace, Next
Select root directory: /path/to/project
Projects->Select All


At this point it fails because there is nothing to select and the next button is deactivated.

Any ideas?

Click "Browse..." button and navigate to johannilsson-android-actionbar\\actionbar
Finish (Now action bar project in your workspace)
Right-click on your project -> Properties
In Android->Library section click Add
select recently added project -> Ok
that's it!


Now you can use it
