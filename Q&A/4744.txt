A:Clickable means that it can be clicked by a pointer device or be tapped by a touch device. Focusable means that it can gain the focus from an input device like a keyboard. Input devices like keyboards cannot decide which view to send its input events to based on the inputs itself, so they send them to the view that has focus.
