Q:I'm trying to create a dynamic link in Firebase, when I'm selecting the android app, it shows an error saying "Add SHA-1 to this android app", I've already added a credential, but I'm not sure how exactly do I "add SHA-1 to the app"

How is this done?

A:sha1 generation in android studio:






Select Gradle in android studio from right panel
Select Your App 
In tasks -> android-> signingReport


Double click signingReport.



You will find the sha1 fingerprint in the "Gradle Console"

add this sha1 fingerprint in firebase console
