Q:I would like to know what the clipToPadding attribute does for ViewGroup in Android ?

I've been through the docs and some websites but none I have come across actually explain what it does and what it means, well none that I could actually understand so I thought it might be a good idea to ask it here.

A:You can use clipToPadding for views that scroll. Say you have a listview for example and you having padding set on the top and bottom. Normally the padding is visible no matter which items are visible on the screen. The diagram below represents a list with 10 items but only 4 are visible on screen, with default clipToPadding settings:


(padding)
item 4
item 5
item 6
item 7
(padding)


Now if you were to set clipToPadding="false" instead of just being applied normally to the entire view it only applies the padding to the end items, this is what you'd see in the same scenario:


item 4
item 5
item 6
item 7


Now if you were to scroll to the top or bottom of the list, this is what you would see:


(padding)
item 1
item 2
item 3
item 4


OR


item 7
item 8
item 9
item 10
(padding)


A practical usage for this is if you have a Floating Action Button for example, you should use clipToPadding combined with bottom padding to ensure the entirety of the bottom item can be seen without being obstructed by the FAB.

Does that make sense?
