Q:Since Ubuntu 13.10 no longer has ia32-libs I cannot get my android development environment running on a clean install of 13.10.

The error is ~/android-studio/sdk/build-tools/android-4.2.2/aapt": error=2, No such file or directory

This file does exist and is executable but it is a 32bit executable.

In previous installs I just installed ia32-libs to fix this but this solution no longer works for Ubuntu 13.10.

I have tried solutions proposed by askubuntu questions eg. this one https://askubuntu.com/questions/107230/what-happened-to-the-ia32-libs-package

but it isn't working for me. 
From that askubuntu.com answer I see I should install separate packages with 

sudo apt-get install package:i386 


but I don't know which packages to install to make the android tools work again.

Has anyone else solved this problem and or does anyone have a list of packages which need to be installed for the android tools?

A:While dpkg --add-architecture i386 command is not needed in the current version of Ubuntu (13.10), it is required in the current Debian versions (7.x) and it will be required in the future Ubuntu versions as well. So I am going to leave it in. Just ignore it for Ubuntu 13.10.

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get -qqy update
sudo apt-get -qqy install libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 zlib1g:i386


Update: aapt indeed requires zlib so I added it to the list. But you should not be needing any lib32 packages.
