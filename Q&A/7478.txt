Q:I'm looking for the source code for Google Play Services. Can someone please point me in the right direction? I've been googling it, but can't find anything.

More specifically, I'm looking for the source code for com.google.android.gms.location.ActivityRecognitionClient.java

Thank you

A:I'm looking for the source code for Google Play Services.


It is closed source, available in source form to Google employees (and maybe select partners).

Aren't we all.
