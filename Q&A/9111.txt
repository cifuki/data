Q:What's the differences/ advantages / drawbacks between using Activity.runOnUiThread or Handler.post(runnable action) in android ?

A:Activity.runOnUiThread, like it's name implies, will execute the Runnable in the thread that is currently responsible for the UI.  So, if you have a CPU intensive task, it can make the UI unresponsive for a short period of time.  Conversely, Handler provides a way for you to create a thread, run some code, and notify the UI when you are done (i.e Handler.sendMessage).

The docs for Handler state this better than I can:


  When a process is created for your
  application, its main thread is
  dedicated to running a message queue
  that takes care of managing the
  top-level application objects
  (activities, broadcast receivers, etc)
  and any windows they create. You can
  create your own threads, and
  communicate back with the main
  application thread through a Handler.
  This is done by calling the same post
  or sendMessage methods as before, but
  from your new thread. The given
  Runnable or Message will than be
  scheduled in the Handler's message
  queue and processed when appropriate.
