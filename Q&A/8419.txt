Q:One developer on my team has some setting in Android Studio that replaces the distributionUrl entry in gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties to use the gradle-###-all.zip, while my Android Studio changes it back to gradle-###-bin.zip.  

Basically, my diff always looks like:

-distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.12-all.zip
+distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.12-bin.zip


This is annoying.  What setting is it, and how do I change it?

A:gradle-1.12-all.zip file will have binaries, sources, and documentation.
gradle-1.12-bin.zip will have only binaries(That should be enough as you don't need any samples/docs)

If you want to know about gradle wrapper, please check this
