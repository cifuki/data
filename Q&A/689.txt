Q:Just implemented Recyclerview in my code, replacing Listview.

everything works fine. The objects are displayed.

but logcat says


  15:25:53.476 E/RecyclerView\xef\xb9\x95 No adapter attached; skipping layout
  
  15:25:53.655 E/RecyclerView\xef\xb9\x95 No adapter attached; skipping layout


for the code

ArtistArrayAdapter adapter = new ArtistArrayAdapter(this, artists);
recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.cardList);
recyclerView.setHasFixedSize(true);
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));


As you can see I have attached an adapter for Recycleview.
so why do I keep getting this error?

i have read other questions related to same problem but none helps.

A:Can you make sure that you are calling these statements from the "main" thread (for example inside the onCreate() method).
As soon as I call the same statements from a "delayed" method. In my case a ResultCallback, I get the same message.

In my Fragment, calling the code below from inside a ResultCallback method produces the same message. After moving the code to the onConnected() method within my app, the message was gone...

LinearLayoutManager llm = new LinearLayoutManager(this);
llm.setOrientation(LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL);
list.setLayoutManager(llm);
list.setAdapter( adapter );
