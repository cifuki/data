Q:I'm trying to connect to a GitLab repository using the I/O preview of Android Studio. Does anyone know how to do this/if it is possible yet?

A:To clone a repo

Open a new project in Android Studio.

Click VCS -> Checkout from version control -> Git

then enter the URL of the repo and your local direcory

To commit

Open the project you want to push in Android Studio.

Click VCS -> Enable version Control -> Git

There does't seem to be a way to add a remote through the GUI. So open Git Bash in the root of the project add do git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>.

Now when you do VCS -> Commit changes -> Commit & Push you should see your remote and everything should work through the GUI.
