Q:I just downloaded the Android Studio. While trying to run it, I had to modify the environment variable and add


  JAVA_HOME


and 


  C:\\Progra~2\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_22


Once I finished that hurdle, now I am receiving another error:

The environment variable JAVA_HOME (with the value of *C:\\Progra~2\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_22*) does not point to a valid JVM installation.


I looked through other similar questions and I was asked to check the version, so I did the following in CMD:

C:\\Users\\Andre>java -version
java version "1.6.0_22"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 17.1-b03, mixed mode, sharing)

C:\\Users\\Andre>javac -version
javac 1.6.0_22


From the results it seems like I have JVM.

I also tried these paths for JAVA_HOME, I closed and reopened a new CMD window each time

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre6
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_22
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre6\\bin
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_22\\bin

A:Point your JAVA_HOME variable to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_xx\\ where "xx" is the update number (make sure this matches your actual directory name). Do not include bin\\javaw.exe in the pathname.

NOTE: You can access the Environment Variables GUI from the CLI by entering rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables. Be sure to put the 'JAVA_HOME' path variable in the System variables rather than the user variables. If the path variable is in User the Android Studio will not find the path.
