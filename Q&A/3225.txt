Q:I'm not sure to have understood well the role played by the several Android /res/layout folders.

layout: general layouts

layout-port: layout for widget that must change for portrait orientation

layout-land: layout for widget that must change for landscape orientation

For example in the Home sample application, under layout-port and layout-land folders there is only one home.xml file.

Have I understood right?

A:If you are in landscape or portrait Android looks for the layout file in either the -port or -land directory first, if it's not found then it falls back to the default layout directory.

You can read about providing alternative resources here. There are many more options than just land and port.
