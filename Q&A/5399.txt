Q:I just updated my HAXM to version 6.2.1 . When I run the emulator I get an error message in the event log of the android studio:


  Emulator: emulator: ERROR: Missing initial data partition file:
  /Users/blabla/.android/avd/Pixel_2_XL_API_25.avd/userdata.img


Nevertheless, the app runs without any problems in the emulator. Does anybody know the solution not to get this message again? Thank You

Edit: Now it works right. I closed and opened android studio

A:As per the comment of @user4938227 (and my experience) it seems like it's a one time warning the should happen at the first run of the emulator. Avd creates the file and on the following runs it shouldn't appear.
