A:You can use ViewFlipper to flip between views. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ViewFlipper.html


  Simple ViewAnimator that will animate between two or more views that
  have been added to it. Only one child is shown at a time. If
  requested, can automatically flip between each child at a regular
  interval.


It is possible to assign different animations. See here for examples or here on SO.

But it depends on what actually you want to flip and animate. You can draw different shapes and drag or animate them.
