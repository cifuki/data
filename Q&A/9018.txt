A:I resolved this issue with three actions, which have fixed this for all Android 4.0+ phones:


Update masked-input to at least version 1.4
Add type="tel" to the input, to trigger the numeric keyboard
Remove the input's maxlength attribute or set it to a value certain not to interfere with the caret action, like 20.
