Q:I have adb running and device is connected to my system in debugging mode,

I want to uninstall app using intent launch using adb shell am start <INTENT>

I don't want to uninstall using adb uninstall com.company.apppackage and I don't want to do it even by using adb shell pm uninstall com.company.apppackage

How can I send an intent with android.intent.action.DELETE action for a specific package allowing the user to see the prompt and uninstall the program?

A:You can do it from adb using this command:

adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.DELETE -d package:<your app package>
