Q:I Have a Custom View which draws text onto the Canvas.
I want to change the Font to a font stored in assets folder.

I am using Android Studio so I created a folder src/main/assets and placed my ttf files in there. 

Paint txt = new Paint()
Typeface font = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(), "robotobold.ttf");
txt.setTypeface(font);


Problem is Android Studio doesn't recognize getAssets() inside my Custom View, however it recognizes it inside my Activity. I have tried passing Typeface through from my Activity but when I do it it doesn't change the font.

A:You can use your View's getContext() method to get the current Context, then use it to get the assets:

Typeface font = Typeface.createFromAsset(getContext().getAssets(), "robotobold.ttf");
