Q:Now i can use the share intent to open the share dialog 

    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
    intent.setType("text/plain");
    intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, link);  
    startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent, "Share with"));


but i need the dialog not to appear and share directly to one social network for example (FB or twitter)

any advice how to do that ?

A:No you can't. Intent's are supposed to work this way. If you have to force a particular app to open, use explicit intents if the target apps support those. Without knowing the package names or the component names of the target apps, or the type or mime type of data, you can't force a particular app to work on generalized intents.
