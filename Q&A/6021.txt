A:First, you can list all the test tasks available in your project with

./gradlew tasks


Then you can choose the tasks you want to execute. If you want to execute all tests for all flavors ans all buildTypes, you just have to run 

./gradlew test connectedAndroidTest


If you don't want to remember all the gradle test command each time you want to run the tests, you can create a file "custom_tasks.gradle" and add

task testAll(dependsOn: ['test', 'connectedAndroidTest']) {
   group = 'custom_tasks'
   description = "Run all tests"
}


Then, you just have to run

./gradlew testAll
