Q:My question is:  is it possible to get the absolute path of a resource (in a subdirectory of the res/ folder) in Android?

Most of the answers I see to this question on google suggest getting a file descriptor, implying that this is not possible.

Is it?

EDIT:  The reason I want to do this is because I'm writing classes that accept a path to media and play it.  Testing would be much easier if I could pass the absolute path of a resource.

A:Use URI Paths instead of "absolute" path, see this post 

Uri path = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.segf4ult.test/" + R.drawable.icon);
Uri otherPath = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.segf4ult.test/drawable/icon");


Or use openRawResource(R.id) to open an inputStream, and use it the same way you would use a FileInputStream (readonly)
