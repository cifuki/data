Q:Is there a way we can update (not reinstall) a non-market apk on an Android device?
I could only find an adb install (nothing like adb update)

A:adb install -r is the closest you get, that is actually an update as it keeps the database and stored preferences. If you uninstall/re-install both the app database and preferences is deleted. What exactly are you trying to update about the app that -r option does not help you with ?
