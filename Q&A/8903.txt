Q:I'm using the monkey tool to run a test of my Android application.  For example, I might do a run like the following:

adb shell monkey -p com.myapp -v 10000


However, if I change my mind and need to cancel the test, there doesn't seem to be a way to do so that doesn't involve waiting multiple minutes for the damned monkey to finish most or all of its run.

Killing the adb shell process on my mac doesn't solve the problem.  Killing the com.myapp process on my phone using ddms doesn't work.  Unplugging my phone doesn't work.

How do I cancel the monkey madness?

A:You can kill the monkey process just doing this:

$ adb shell ps | awk '/com\\.android\\.commands\\.monkey/ { system("adb shell kill " $2) }'
