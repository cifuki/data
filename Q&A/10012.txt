Q:Is there a way I can suppress individual warnings about hardcoded strings in layout files?

I often put placeholder text into TextViews so that I can see them in layout at design time. The downside of this is getting a ton of these warnings about hardcoded strings. But without them I wouldn't see the TextViews at all in the layout.

A:In Eclipse, go to Window->Preferences->Android->Lint Error Checking.

Scroll down to and select Hardcoded Text (under Internationalization). On the Severity drop down box, select Ignore and click on Apply.
