Q:In onOptionsItemSelected... I saw some code that are different in the switch block.

Case 1 (Normally seen)

public boolean onOptionsItemSelected (MenueItem item)
       switch (item.getItemId()){
             case R.id.item1:
             startActivity (new Intent (this, PrefsActivity.class));
             break;
       }
       return true


Case 2 (unsure of why it's set up this way)

public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
       switch (item.getItemId()) {
               case MENU_NEW_GAME:
               newGame();
               return true;
       }
       return false;


My Question

What are the differences between Case 1 and Case 2?

A:kleaver,

Per the documentation for onOptionsItemSelected()


  Returns
  
  boolean Return false to allow normal
  menu processing to proceed, true to
  consume it here.


The if returned true the click event will be consumed by the onOptionsItemSelect() call and won't fall through to other item click functions.  If your return false it may check the ID of the event in other item selection functions.

Your method will still work, but may result in unnecessary calls to other functions.  The ID will ultimately fall through those functions since there is no switch to catch it, but return false is more correct.
