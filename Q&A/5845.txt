Q:After updating Android Studio, I have .AndroidStudio1.3 and .AndroidStudio1.4 folders. If I delete .AndroidStudio1.3 folder, will this cause any problems?

A:No, you're good to go removing the prior version's directory which in this case is the .AndroidStudio1.3 directory.

On a side note, make sure you're importing settings from 1.3 when upgrading to 1.4. That will spare the Android Studio from re-downloading all the existing project dependencies you worked with before.
