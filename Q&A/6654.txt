Q:In some methods of my Activity I want to check the title of menu or know if it is checked or not. How can I get Activity's menu. I need something like this.getMenu()

A:Be wary of invalidateOptionsMenu().  It recreates the entire menu.  This has a lot of overhead and will reset embedded components like the SearchView.  It took me quite a while to track down why my SearchView would "randomly" close.

I ended up capturing the menu as posted by Dark and then call onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu) as necessary.  This met my requirement without an nasty side effects.  Gotcha:  Make sure to do a null check in case you call onPrepareOptionsMenu() before the menu is created.  I did this as below:

private Menu mOptionsMenu;

@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(final Menu menu) {
    mOptionsMenu = menu
    ...
}

private void updateOptionsMenu() {
    if (mOptionsMenu != null) {
        onPrepareOptionsMenu(mOptionsMenu);
    }
}
