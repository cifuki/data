Q:Obviously I need the correct import statment to solve this problem. According to the docs for AndroidJUnit4, this should be 

import android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnit4;


When I do that, Android Studio highlights runner in red and complains "Cannot resolve symbol 'runner'".

Background

I got to this point by following the tutorials on the Android Developer site for setting up tests using UI Automator. The first problem I encountered was that com.android.support:support-v4:22.2.0 and com.android.support.test:runner:0.2 depend on different versions of com.android.support:support-annotations. I followed the suggestions from this Android bug report and added the following to allprojects in my project's build.gradle:

configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.force 'com.android.support:support-annotations:22.1.0'
}


This solved the immediate error, but I suspect it lead to my current problems. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to fix this?
