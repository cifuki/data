Q:The section "Avoid Enums Where You Only Need Ints" was removed from the official developer documentation. (See Why doesn't Android use more enums? for the old section content)

Why? Was there a change in the Android VM that made the tip obsolete?

A:the original version of that document was just a bunch of prejudices. it's been rewritten to only contain facts backed up by actual benchmarks, and it's updated as the VM is updated. you can find the various benchmarks -- plus some of the benchmarks we use to optimize the core libraries -- at http://code.google.com/p/dalvik/.
