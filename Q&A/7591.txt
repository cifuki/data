Q:I have some text that have more than one paragraph (using "\
") and want to put a spacing between the paragraphs, but without using "\
\
". But the text from the same paragraph I want to keep them with a lower space.

I tried using lineSpacingExtra and lineSpacingMultiplier but it sets spaces to every line (insinde the paragraph too).

I want something like this:

A:You can use Spannable's to achieve this:

String formattedText = text.replaceAll("\
", "\
\
");
SpannableString spannableString = new SpannableString(formattedText);

Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile("\
\
").matcher(formattedText);
while (matcher.find()) {
    spannableString.setSpan(new AbsoluteSizeSpan(25, true), matcher.start() + 1, matcher.end(), Spannable.SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE);
}


The code above replaces all line breaks with two line breaks. After that it sets absolute size for each second line break.
