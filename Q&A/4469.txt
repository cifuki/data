Q:I've seen the "share via" dialogs that are in apps like TFLN (texts from last night).
Looks like this: share dialog http://garr.me/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sharevia.jpg

I am looking to share text. Can someone point me in the right direction? Is this done with intents?

A:This is indeed done with Intents.

For sharing an image, like in the example picture, it would be something like this:

Intent share = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
share.setType("image/jpeg");

share.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM,
  Uri.parse("file:///sdcard/DCIM/Camera/myPic.jpg"));

startActivity(Intent.createChooser(share, "Share Image"));


For text you would use something like:

Intent share = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
share.setType("text/plain");
share.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "I'm being sent!!");
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(share, "Share Text"));
