Q:By default, when I change Build Variants to release I don't get any Logs on the logcat, but I do need to read release logs of my app, how can I enable this?

A:Add android:debuggable="true" (default is false) to your Manifest inside the <application> tag. 

From the docs:


  android:debuggable
  Whether or not the application can be debugged,
  even when running on a device in user mode \xe2\x80\x94 "true" if it can be, and
  "false" if not.


respectively


  You can disable debugging by removing the android:debuggable attribute
  from the  tag in your manifest file, or by setting the
  android:debuggable attribute to false in your manifest file.


Edit

You may need to add the following to your build.gradle file inside the android{...} tag:

lintOptions {
   checkReleaseBuilds false
}


And as a side-note: Right on the device the Logs are always written, no matter if your application's debuggable is set to false or true. But via the LogCat in Android Studio it's only possible if debuggable is set to true. (Just tested this)
