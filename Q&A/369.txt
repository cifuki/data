Q:I want to disable the orange highlight that occurs when touching a listView row. So far in my xml I have tried the following:

android:focusable="false"
android:focusableInTouchMode="false"
android:clickable="false"


More information: I want there to be zero difference when a user touches the screen on this listView object.

A:Add this to your xml:

android:listSelector="@android:color/transparent"


And for the problem this may work (I'm not sure and I don't know if there are better solutions):

You could apply a ColorStateList to your TextView.
