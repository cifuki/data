Q:I moved my Android project to a laptop and now I get this when I hit Debug. Sounds like this is a bug? This shouldn't happen via Eclipse as far as I know.

Re-installation failed due to different application signatures.


The weirdest thing is this happened after I upgraded sdk/adt and Eclipse to support SDK 2.2 It was working fine earlier, and now it doesn't, so it might be a bug.

A:It happens because keystores on your laptop and original pc are different. it's called debug.keystrore
and located in %USER_HOME%/.android/ folder. TO be more specific it happens because eclipse tries to push apk with reinstall key. So you have two options


Share debug.keystore between various development pc's
Manually uninstall your apk from device ( using adb )
