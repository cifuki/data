Q:OnTouch of an ImageView I'm starting a fade in animation:

    myImageView.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
    v.startAnimation(fadeInAnimation);


I know it's need an animation listener to find out when the animation is complete but how do I attach this so that I can get the view that the animation has just completed on... I want to set the visibility of the view after the animation is done.

Thanks

A:I think you need this.

fadeInAnimation.setAnimationListener(new Animation.AnimationListener() {
    @Override
    public void onAnimationStart(Animation animation) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onAnimationEnd(Animation animation) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onAnimationRepeat(Animation animation) {

    }
});
