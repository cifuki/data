Q:I am working in android material design api & want to display some data in grid format. I tried both GridLayout and StaggeredGridlayout and both look same. For general information, i want to ask what is the difference between Gridlayout and StaggeredGridlayout?
Thank you.

A:Grid View : It is is a ViewGroup that displays items in a two-dimensional, scrollable grid. In this each Grid is of same size (Height and width). Grid View shows symmetric items in view.



Staggered Grid View : It is basically an extension to Grid View but in this each Grid is of varying size(Height and width). Staggered Grid View shows asymmetric items in view.
