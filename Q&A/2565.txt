Q:I have a little issue with creating a directory and saving a file to it on my android application. I'm using this piece of code to do this :

String filename = "MyApp/MediaTag/MediaTag-"+objectId+".png";
File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), filename);
FileOutputStream fos;

fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
fos.write(mediaTagBuffer);
fos.flush();
fos.close();


But it's throwing an exception :


  java.io.FileNotFoundException: /mnt/sdcard/MyApp/MediaCard/MediaCard-0.png (No such file or directory)


on that line : fos = new FileOutputStream(file);

If I set the filename to : "MyApp/MediaTag-"+objectId+" it's working, but If I try to create and save the file to an another directory it's throwing the exception. So any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

And another question: Is there any way to make my files private in external storage so user can't see them in gallery, only if he connect his device as Disk Drive?

A:Use this function to save your bitmap in SD card 

private void SaveImage(Bitmap finalBitmap) {

    String root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString();
    File myDir = new File(root + "/saved_images");    
     if (!myDir.exists()) {
                    myDir.mkdirs();
                }
    Random generator = new Random();
    int n = 10000;
    n = generator.nextInt(n);
    String fname = "Image-"+ n +".jpg";
    File file = new File (myDir, fname);
    if (file.exists ())
      file.delete (); 
    try {
        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);
        finalBitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 90, out);
        out.flush();
        out.close();

    } catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
    }
}


and add this in manifest

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /> 


EDIT: By using this line you will be able to see saved images in the gallery view.

sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED,
                         Uri.parse("file://" + Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory())));
