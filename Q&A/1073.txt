Q:I am having lots of logging statements to debug for example.

Log.v(TAG, "Message here");
Log.w(TAG, " WARNING HERE");


while deploying this application on device phone i want to turn off the verbose logging from where i can enable/disable logging.

A:A common way is to make an int named loglevel, and define its debug level based on loglevel.

public static int LOGLEVEL = 2;
public static boolean ERROR = LOGLEVEL > 0;
public static boolean WARN = LOGLEVEL > 1;
...
public static boolean VERBOSE = LOGLEVEL > 4;

    if (VERBOSE) Log.v(TAG, "Message here"); // Won't be shown
    if (WARN) Log.w(TAG, "WARNING HERE");    // Still goes through


Later, you can just change the LOGLEVEL for all debug output level.
