Q:I currently do a lot of WPF development and have started creating some basic Android apps. When creating WPF apps I often use MVVM, normally using Prism, and would like to know if there are any examples of MVVM for the Android platform?

A:I am the developer of Android-Binding. Like @Brentley said, it's a very new project but I do hope to get more buzz and experience so that it can be improved. Back to your question, I have written some simple introduction/tutorials on MVVM with android-binding:


Android MVVM Tutorials (with android binding)
Introduction to Android Binding (codeproject)
Model Validation in Android Binding (codeproject)
