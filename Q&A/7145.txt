Q:I have following question. In my app there is a listview. I get itemname from listview and transfer it to the webview as a string. How to ignore case of this string and change spaces to underscores?

For example: String itemname = "First Topic". I transfer it to the next activity and want to ignore case and change space to underscore (I want to get first_topic in result).
I get "itemname" in webviewactivity and want to do what I've described for following code:

String filename = bundle.getString("itemname") + ".html";


Please, help.

A:use replaceAll and toLowerCase methods like this:

myString = myString.replaceAll(" ", "_").toLowerCase()
