Q:I know that the following code should show and hide a tiny circular progress bar with the following code in Android:

requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_INDETERMINATE_PROGRESS);
setProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true);
setProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(false);


The problem is that I am using a TabHost and I need to be able to do this from one of the "child" activities. Is there any way I can go about doing this?

I found this question on the intarwebs but as you can see, it went unanswered.

A:And I found the answer. In your parent activity, before you do anything, you need to do the requestWindowFeature call, and then in your child activity you call getParent().setProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true/false);
