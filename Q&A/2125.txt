Q:Since I found some older posts, that tell that whatsapp doesn't support this, I was wondering if something had changed and if there is a way to open a whatsapp 'chat' with a number that I'm sending through an intent?

A:UPDATE
Please refer to https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000030/?category=5245251


  WhatsApp's Click to Chat feature allows you to begin a chat with
  someone without having their phone number saved in your phone's
  address book. As long as you know this person\xe2\x80\x99s phone number, you can
  create a link that will allow you to start a chat with them. 
  
  Use: https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=15551234567
  
  Don't use: https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+001-(555)1234567
  
  Example: https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=15551234567&text=I'm%20interested%20in%20your%20car%20for%20sale


Original answer 
Here is the solution 

public void onClickWhatsApp(View view) {

    PackageManager pm=getPackageManager();
    try {

        Intent waIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        waIntent.setType("text/plain");
        String text = "YOUR TEXT HERE";

        PackageInfo info=pm.getPackageInfo("com.whatsapp", PackageManager.GET_META_DATA);
        //Check if package exists or not. If not then code 
        //in catch block will be called
        waIntent.setPackage("com.whatsapp");

        waIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, text);
        startActivity(Intent.createChooser(waIntent, "Share with"));

   } catch (NameNotFoundException e) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "WhatsApp not Installed", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                .show();
   }  

}
