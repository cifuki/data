When I want to export a signed apk, I get this message : 

the zipalign tool was not found in the sdk


I've updated my sdk, my eclipse, still get it.
Then, I saw I had no file called zipalign in my sdk/tools folder.
So I copied one I had in another sdk folder, as I saw in another post.

I checked this post : Error while running zipalign
I'm exporting to the desktop, so I have rights.

I have no idea, what should I do now. It seems that this problems happens after updating sdk

PD: I use Mac.

Any Idea?

A:In Eclipse, go to Window \xe2\x86\x92 Android SDK Manager, check Android SDK **Build-tools** Rev. 20 and then click Install.

After the update restart Eclipse and try again.
