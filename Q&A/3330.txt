Q:I am trying to convert a hex value to an int so I can create a new color drawable. I'm not sure if this is possible, but according to the documentation, it should. It plainly asks for


  public ColorDrawable (int color)
  
  Added in API level 1 Creates a new ColorDrawable with the specified
  color.
  
  Parameters color    The color to draw.


So, my code isn't working because I'm getting an Invalid int: "FF6666" error. Any ideas?

int decode = Integer.decode("FF6666");
ColorDrawable colorDrawable = new ColorDrawable(decode);

A:Since you're talking about hex you have to start with 0x and don't forget the opacity.

So basically: 0xFFFF6666

ColorDrawable cd = new ColorDrawable(0xFFFF6666);


You can also create a new colors.xml file into /res and define the colors like:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <color name="mycolor">#FF6666</color>
</resources>


and simply get the color defined in R.color.mycolor

getResources().getColor(R.color.mycolor)
