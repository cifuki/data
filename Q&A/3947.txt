Q:When I toggle on the install via USB in developer mode:


it will pop the toast message said that the device is temporarily restricted
then toggle off the settings. 


Is there any solution for this?
I searched through all the way like turning off MIUI optimization but still does not work. I cannot debug my application by Android Studio in this way......

A:For me on a rooted MIUI v.8.5.1 I just need to:  


turn off wifi 
turn on mobile connection In development options 


after doing that both Install via USB and USB debugging started to work.
