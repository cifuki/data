Q:I've tried all scaletypes, but all of them result in the image to be at the left corner of the imageview.

 <ImageView
    android:id="@+id/image"
    android:scaleType="centerInside"

    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"

    android:layout_marginRight="6dip"
    android:background="#0000" 
    android:src="@drawable/icon1" />

A:Your ImageView has the attribute wrap_content. I would think that the Image is centered inside the imageview but the imageview itself is not centered in the parentview. If you have only the imageview on the screen try match_parent instead of wrap_content. If you have more then one view in the layout you have to center the imageview.
