Q:I have a LinearLayout and ImageView inside this LinearLayout. 

There is a translation effect for ImageView.

// v = ImageView    
ObjectAnimator animation2 = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(v, "translationY", 200);
                        animation2.setDuration(3000);
                        animation2.setTarget(v);
                        animation2.start();


Animation working but it's disappearing when ImageView go outside of LinearLayout. 

You can see problem here : http://screenr.com/zoAH

How can i fix it without modify LinearLayout's height.

A:Find the ViewGroup that the ImageView belongs to and apply ViewGroup.setClipChildren(false).
By default, the drawing of the children is limited to the bounds of the parent ViewGroup.
