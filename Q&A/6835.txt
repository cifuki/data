Q:I'm trying out the android graphics classes.
I wanted to draw some arcs/circles with a fill color and black outline.
The Paint class has a style for FILL_AND_STROKE, but there doesn't seem to be a way to set the fill color vs. stroke color.  So as far as I can tell it's the same as FILL?

So what's the point of FILL_AND_STROKE if you can't set a separate fill and stroke color?
I haven't managed to find a good explanation.

(I solved my simple problem by doing a fill first, then a stroke, naturally)

Edit:
I ran into this bug report: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=4086

Comment 4 and 5 seem to imply that FILL_AND_STROKE is basically the same as FILL and it will be 'fixed' in 2.2.  I guess they'll add a new color?

A:afaik: FILL fills your circle, while FILL_AND_STROKE also draws the border. If you increase the size of the stroke, it should result in different circles sizes (only visual!)

Think about this: you draw a circle by hand with a small sized pencil. The radius is what you wanted. If you now take a big brush and draw the circle again, your radius is much bigger... (i hope its understandable O.o )
