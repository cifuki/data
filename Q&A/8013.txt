Q:I usually set up some kind of AlertDialog to fire off when a user first uses one of my apps and I explain how to use the app and give an overall introduction to what they just downloaded. I also usually load my strings from a strings.xml file. 

What I want to do is make one of the words in my string resource clickable like a hyperlink on a web page. Basically you'd have an AlertDialog and within the string resource there would be a highlighted word or possibly just a web address that they could press.  I suppose I could just add a button that would take them to the site but I just wanted to know if making a word in your string resource a clickable hyperlink was possible.

A:Just use an HTML format link in your resource: 

<string name="my_link"><a href="http://somesite.com/">Click me!</a></string>

You can then use setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance()) on your TextView to make the link clickable.

There is also TextView's android:autoLink attribute which should also work.
