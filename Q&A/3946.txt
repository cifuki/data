Q:I'm using the OkHttp library for a new project and am impressed with its ease of use.  I now have a need to use Basic Authentication.  Unfortunately, there is a dearth of working sample code.  I'm seeking an example of how to pass username / password credentials to the OkAuthenticator when an HTTP 401 header is encountered.  I viewed this answer:

Retrofit POST request w/ Basic HTTP Authentication: "Cannot retry streamed HTTP body"

but it didn't get me too far.  The samples on the OkHttp github repo didn't feature an authentication-based sample either.  Does anyone have a gist or other code sample to get me pointed in the right direction?  Thanks for your assistance!

A:Try using OkAuthenticator:

client.setAuthenticator(new OkAuthenticator() {
  @Override public Credential authenticate(
      Proxy proxy, URL url, List<Challenge> challenges) throws IOException {
    return Credential.basic("scott", "tiger");
  }

  @Override public Credential authenticateProxy(
      Proxy proxy, URL url, List<Challenge> challenges) throws IOException {
    return null;
  }
});


UPDATE:

Renamed to Authenticator
