Q:I created a SQLite database on Android device. The program can read/write to database so the database file has obviously been created. The SQLiteDatabase.mPath is set to

db.mPath = "/data/data/dev.client.android/databases/clientDB.db"


but when I browse the directories on the device I can't locate the file clientDB.db. I looked inside data directory  but it appears to be empty.

Does anyone know what could be wrong here?

A:If you mean you visited /data and found nothing in it, and you are examining an ordinary piece of Android hardware, that is expected. DDMS does not have permission to browse through /data.

However, at least if your app is compiled in debug mode, you can use the adb pull command at the console to download your file directly.
