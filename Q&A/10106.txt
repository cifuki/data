Q:So I'm setting a button's background doing this:

b.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.custom_button1);


How do I programmatically set it back to the default (boring grey) Android button? Is there a R.android.boring_grey resource identifier I can reference without recreating those states myself? Couldn't seem to find it. Maybe my Googling skills are failing me.

Oh and by the way I tried this:

   b.setBackgroundResource(0);


And the button actually disappeared (blended with black background?).

A:Have you tried this?

android.R.drawable.btn_default;
