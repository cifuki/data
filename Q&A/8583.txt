Q:I have created a new Image Assets in the Drawable cus I need to insert a new image in my app, but every time I create a new image asset, the output turns to be no colour at all. I've attached the pic of it.

It's confusing and whenever I import it in my layout, it's just grey all over as you can see in the image. Why is it cus I can't find any ready solutions? Let me know if I'm overlooked.

A:I got the answer for my own question which I find it's useful for some who still do not know how to enable the Batch Drawable Import. It's easy and just need to download plugin and install. I've read that the latest version already has it and I've downloaded and reinstalled, but it didn't show as what I was expecting. The solution is to download and install it. 


  
  First, In Android Studio, go to Default Setting File --> Setting or you can simple Click the SDK Manager Icon  
  In the Default Setting, go to Plugins 
  In the search option, type Batch Drawable Import and you'll see there's Android Drawable Importer. 
  In my image, it's already installed, Click Install Plugin and just follow the instructions.
  You'll have to restart Android Studio and try to create a new Batch Drawable Import and you'll find it there. ;) Thanks.
