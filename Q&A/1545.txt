Q:Trying to create an android app with Facebook integration, I've gotten to the part in the docs where you have to generate a key hash file, it specifies to run the following code

keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore 
| openssl sha1 -binary
| openssl base64


When I run this in my terminal I get an error for Keystore tampered with or password was incorrect,

I just want to generate my Key Hash

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

A:Delete your debug certificate under ~/.android/debug.keystore (on Linux and Mac OS X); the directory is something like %USERHOME%/.android on Windows.

The Eclipse plugin should then generate a new certificate when you next try to build a debug package.

Let me know if that works.
