Q:I can't find this information. Is it true that Android React Native runs on sdkMin18 and therefore makes it supported by most android versions?

A:You can run it on minSdk 16 as it is documented on the framework's github page.


  React Native apps may target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer.
