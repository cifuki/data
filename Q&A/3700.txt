I'm building an app that uses a lot of images, so it's getting pretty big. I got more than 15mb in PNG images, and if I convert those images to JPG I would get 5MB or less! So, why should I use PNG instead of JPG?

I know that PNGs are preferred, but what would I lose with JPG?

EDIT: Thank you everybody!

Just a note: Since I got my answer and turns out that I will need to use PNG in most files, I found out that website http://tinypng.org/ , and that's helping me a lot. My 15mb of images are now 7mb. So, if anyone is in the same situation that I am, I hope that it helps!

A:Major reason - PNG will give you advantage of Alpha Transparency over JPG.
