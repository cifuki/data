Q:Possible Duplicate:
  Android - Open resource from @drawable String  




First of all sorry for the title but I don't know exactly what title I can set.

Ok, here's my question:

I will recibe from a external database a string for example: 'picture0001'.

In the folder res/drawable I have a picture which name is picture0001.

I would like to set that picture as background (source) of a ImageView.

The question is, how can I look for this picture with the string I got from the external database.

Thank you so much.

A:Yes, you can look it up by name using Resources.getIdentifier().

Context context = imageView.getContext();
int id = context.getResources().getIdentifier("picture0001", "drawable", context.getPackageName());
imageView.setImageResource(id);


It's not efficient, but it works to look up occasional resources.
