Q:I am trying to create a new project from existing source code. I keep getting the following error: "Invalid Project Description", project path "overlaps the location of another project" with the same name. The reason is that I created that project from the source code before, but then I deleted that project and deleted its whole directory, before adding the source code directory again. I tried everything like cleaning and restarting, but nothing worked. I looked in my workspace directory, but there are no traces for the old project.
There are several questions around this problem such as this Attempting Android Notepad Tutorial - Exercise 1 - More problems, but none of the answers worked for me!

A:Go into your workspace, and move your project source code folder to another area outside of your workspace (like the desktop).  Make sure the project is deleted in eclipse, then create a new project from source from that directory.

Another thing you could do is try creating a project of a different name (from the first project's source), so that the workspace will contain the new project as a functional project.  Then, go into your workspace directory and absolutely delete the folder that contained the original project, or move it.  Try loading the project from source again, this time using the second project, by naming it with the correct name.  Or, you could try refactoring the second project back to the first's name.
