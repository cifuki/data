Q:I have a text file on my server. I want to open the text file from my Android App and then display the text in a TextView. I cannot find any examples of how to do a basic connection to a server and feed the data into a String.

Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

A:Try the following:

try {
    // Create a URL for the desired page
    URL url = new URL("mysite.com/thefile.txt");

    // Read all the text returned by the server
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream()));
    String str;
    while ((str = in.readLine()) != null) {
        // str is one line of text; readLine() strips the newline character(s)
    }
    in.close();
} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
} catch (IOException e) {
}


(taken from Exampledepot: Getting text from URL)

Should work well on Android.
