Q:I don't want the user to be able to go back to the splashscreen of my app. One solution seems to be to check if the activity below the current one is an instance of the splashscreen, and in that case exit the app, as shown in the code below. However, I don't know how to check what's the  previous activity in the stack. Anybody can help? Is there any other way to disable 'go back' to a given activity?

@Override
public void onBackPressed() { 
    if(<previous activity in stack is an instance of splashscreen>){   
        Intent exit_intent=new Intent(CurrentActivity.this, SplashScreen.class);
        exit_intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
        exit_intent.putExtra("EXIT", true);
        context.startActivity(exit_intent);
    }
}

A:Call finish() in your Splash Screen activity right after starting the next activity. 

Another approach is to add this attribute to your activity in AndroidManifest.xml: android:noHistory="true"

Example:

<activity android:name=".SplashActivity" android:noHistory="true"/>


This attribute instructs Android to remove SplashActivity from the history stack once its navigated away from.
