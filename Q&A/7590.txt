Is there a difference between

new Handler.post(Runnable r);


and

activity.runOnUiThread(Runnable r)

A:runOnUiThread is basically suited to show a progress dialog or do some UI manipulations before an AsyncTask call.
If you want to update the UI in the middle of a thread execution, then the best approach is to create a Handler which will update your UI, and let the thread continue running, for example, updating a text view periodically after a few sec, say timer functionality.
