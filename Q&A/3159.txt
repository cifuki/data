Q:I want to open a file from the folder res/raw/. 
I am absolutely sure that the file exists.
To open the file I have tried

File ddd = new File("res/raw/example.png");


The command 

ddd.exists(); 


yields FALSE. So this method does not work.

Trying

MyContext.getAssets().open("example.png");


ends up in an exception with getMessage() "null".

Simply using 

R.raw.example


is not possible because the filename is only known during runtime as a string.

Why is it so difficult to access a file in the folder /res/raw/ ?

A:With the help of the given links I was able to solve the problem myself. The correct way is to get the resource ID with

getResources().getIdentifier("FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION",
                             "raw", getPackageName());


To get it as a InputStream

InputStream ins = getResources().openRawResource(
            getResources().getIdentifier("FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION",
            "raw", getPackageName()));
