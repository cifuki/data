Q:Some users of my Android application report bugs when the mobile enters sleep/power saving mode.

I would like to test that issue on the Android Virtual Device. Is it possible to simulate the mobile entering in sleep/power saving mode on the AVD ?

Thanks in advance.

A:Try the following on emulator


Go to Settings
Go to Developer options
Un-check Stay awake (3rd option from the top)


The emulator will go to sleep after 1 min (default setting) if not changed.

Press the power button  to wake up the emulator.

Developer options is not enabled by default, to enable it, do the following:


Go to Settings
Click About emulated device
Click Build number 7 times, you should be notified that Developer options is now enabled
Go back and you should see Developer options
