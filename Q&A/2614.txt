Q:Is it possible to achieve negative margin on constraint layout to achieve overlap? 
I am trying to have a image centered on the layout and have a Text view such that it overlaps a by x dp. I tried setting negative margin value but no luck. 
It would be great if there is a way to achieve this.

A:Although it doesn't appear that negative margins will be supported in ConstraintLayout, there is a way to accomplish the effect using the tools that are available and supported. Here is an image where the image title is overlapped 22dp from the bottom of the image - effectively a -22dp margin:



This was accomplished by using a Space widget with a bottom margin equal to the offset that you want. The Space widget then has its bottom constrained to the bottom of the ImageView. Now all you need to do is to constrain the top of the TextView with the image title to the bottom of the Space widget. The TextView will be positioned at the bottom the the Space view ignoring the margin that was set.

The following is the XML that accomplishes this effect. I will note that I use Space because it is lightweight and intended for this type of use, but I could have used another type of View and made it invisible. (You will probably need to make adjustments, though.) You could also define a View with zero margins and the height of the inset margin you want, and constrain the top of the TextView to the top of the inset View.

Yet another approach would be to overlay the TextView on top of the ImageView by aligning tops/bottoms/lefts/right and make suitable adjustments to margins/padding. The benefit of the approach demonstrated below is that a negative margin can be created without a lot of computation. That is all to say that there are several ways to approach this.

Update: For a quick discussion and demo of this technique, see the Google Developers Medium blog post.
