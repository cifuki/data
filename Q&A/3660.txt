Q:I have a Service and BroadcastReceiver in my application, but how do I launch the service directly from the BroadcastReceiver? Using

startService(new Intent(this, MyService.class));


does not work in a BroadcastReceiver, any ideas?

EDIT:


  context.startService(..);


works, I forgot the context part
