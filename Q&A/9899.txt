Q:The Android Developers reference says that both the WebView.PictureListener interface and its onNewPicture() method are deprecated.

Fine, but the need to know when WebView renders a picture is still there. Is there an alternative way to accomplishing this?

A:Ok after careful review of the APIs, it seems this cannot be done without using PictureListener. Obviously the person who deprecated this feature didn't provide an alternative.

I suggest you write a bug report http://code.google.com/p/android/issues and ask people here to star it.
