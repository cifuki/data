Q:I cant seem to get build tools for the latest gradle at all. I suspect its something to do with proxy setting for gradle. I have had a good look online but still cant seem to find a solution. I use gradle 2.1.

I created gradle.properties file in my /home/user/.gradle folder with these setting.


  systemProp.http.proxyHost=proxy 
  systemProp.http.proxyPort=80
  systemProp.http.proxyUser=myusername
  systemProp.http.proxyPassword=password
  
  systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy 
  systemProp.https.proxyPort=80
  systemProp.https.proxyUser=myusername
  systemProp.https.proxyPassword=password


Here is my global build.gradle

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.13.0'
        classpath fileTree(dir: 'build-libs', include: '*.jar')
    }
}


allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}


And here is the error i get when running grawlew
 Could not HEAD 'https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/android/tools/build/gradle/0.13.0/gradle-0.13.0.pom'.
peer not authenticated

What am i missing? that maven link opens fine in a browser.

A:Right im not sure if it will work for others but worked for me.

I changed proxyPort to 8080 and used jcenter instead of Maven. But i had to apply expeption to use HTTP instead of HTTPS. This is what i have in my gradle.build for build script and allprojects

buildscript {
repositories {
    jcenter {
        url "http://jcenter.bintray.com/"
    }
  }
}

allprojects {
repositories {
    jcenter {
        url "http://jcenter.bintray.com/"
    }
  }
}


UPDATE: 06/08

I have recently updated Gradle and plugin version and had some problems. It was complaining about plugin com.android.application

I did some digging around and changed

 jcenter {
    url "http://jcenter.bintray.com/"
}


to 

    repositories {
    maven { url 'http://repo1.maven.org/maven2' }
}
