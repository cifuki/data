Q:The code pasted below was taken from java docs on HttpURLConnection.

I get the following error: 

readStream(in) 


as there is no such method.  

I see this same thing in
the Class Overview for URLConnection at
URLConnection.getInputStream()

Where is readStream? The code snippet is provided below:

 URL url = new URL("http://www.android.com/");   
    HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();   
    try 
    {     
        InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());     
        readStream(in);  <-----NO SUCH METHOD
    }
    finally 
    {     
        urlConnection.disconnect();   
    }

A:Try with this code:

InputStream in = address.openStream();
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    result.append(line);
}
System.out.println(result.toString());
