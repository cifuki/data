Q:How can I get the text from a pressed button? (Android)

I can get the text from a button:

String buttonText = button.getText();


I can get the id from a pressed button:

int buttinID = view.getId();


What I can't find out at this moment is how to get the text on the pressed button.

public void onClick(View view) {
  // Get the text on the pressed button
}

A:The view you get passed in on onClick() is the Button you are looking for.

public void onClick(View v) {
    // 1) Possibly check for instance of first 
    Button b = (Button)v;
    String buttonText = b.getText().toString();
}


1) If you are using a non-anonymous class as onClickListener, you may want to check for the
type of the view before casting it, as it may be something different than a Button.
