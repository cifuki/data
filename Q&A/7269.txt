Q:Ctrl+F11 on Eclipse is a life saver. Unfortunately, it only works when the currently selected file tab is of a .java file. It doesn't work when the currently selected file tab is of an .xml file.

I searched this great SO resource and found something very similar to what I am looking for but unfortunately the solution offered simply doesn't work for XML in an Android project.

Is there a way to make Ctrl+F11 launch Android project even when on XML file?

This is my current preferences dialog windows:



Update: This mysteriously started working. I have no idea how this happened (I didn't change anything in the Eclipse, except for existing Eclipse and restarting it).

A:This fixed the problem for me.

Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Run/Debug -> Launching -> Launch Operation -> Always Launch the previously launched application
