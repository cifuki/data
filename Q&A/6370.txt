Q:I'm developing some Application which allows select image from SD Card, save it into database and set this value for ImageView. I need to know way for converting uri to string and string to uri. Now I used getEncodedPath() method of Uri, but, for example, this code doesn't work:

ImageView iv=(ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imageView1);
Uri uri=Uri.parse("/external/images/media/470939");
Log.e("uri1", uri.toString());
iv.setImageURI(uri);


Therefore I don't know how I can save Uri into database and create a new Uri from saved value. Please, help me to fix it.

A:I need to know way for converting uri to string and string to uri. 


Use toString() to convert a Uri to a String. Use Uri.parse() to convert a String to a Uri.

That is not a valid string representation of a Uri. A Uri has a scheme, and "/external/images/media/470939" does not have a scheme.
