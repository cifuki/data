Q:I have a service that has its own thread running on background. I'd like to kill that service including the thread. 

I created the thread like this and run it.

 public class DaemonService extends Service {

     private DaemonThread thread;
     class DaemonThread extends Thread {
          public void run()
          {
               runDaemon(mArgv.toArray(), mConfig);
          }
     }

     public void onStart(Intent intent, int startId) {
          thread = new DaemonThread();
          thread.start();
     }
 }


How do I kill the service and the thread as well? I don't have to worry about data safety..

A:to kill the thread , i think you can do like this : 

myService.getThread().interrupt();


NOTE :  the method Thread.stop() is deprecated

EDIT : : try this 

public void stopThread(){
  if(myService.getThread()!=null){
      myService.getThread().interrupt();
      myService.setThread(null);
  }
}
