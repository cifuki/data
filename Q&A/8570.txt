Q:I have obfuscated my apk, but the file size has only been reduced from 12MB to 10.5MB.

The reason it is only a relatively small reduction may be because my app uses a couple of large libraries, but is there any way I can check the level of obfuscation that has been performed?

Just in case, this is my proguard-project.txt file...

# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

-dontwarn twitter4j.**


...and the libraries I'm using are android-support-v4.jar, acra-4.5.0.jar and twitter4j-core-4.0.2.jar.

A:In your project directory you will find a Proguard folder, in which you will see four text files:

dump.txt


  Describes the internal structure of all the class files in the .apk file


mapping.txt


  Lists the mapping between the original and obfuscated class, method, and field names. This file is important when you receive a bug report from
      a release build, because it translates the obfuscated stack trace back to the
      original class, method, and member names. See Decoding Obfuscated Stack Traces
      for more information.


seeds.txt


  Lists the classes and members that are not obfuscated


usage.txt


  Lists the code that was stripped from the .apk

Hope this helps!
