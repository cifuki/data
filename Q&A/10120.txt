Q:does anyone know a possibility to simulate a low bandwidth on android phones (i.e. EDGEor G3) while connected to WIFI?

Is there a app for this?

It it possible to do something like this ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/130465 ) on android devices?

Thanks in advance for any tips.

Edit: I don't want to use the simulator. I need it to do reproducable performance measurements for my bachelor's thesis. Using UMTS is just not reproducable enough that's why im looking for something to simulate it.

A:You can also just change the preferred network type to 2G. 

Its not as fine-grained as throttling your bandwidth via the PC but its a lot simpler to implement.



On Android 5 Lollipop go to:


Settings
More
Cellular Networks
Preferred network type


You'll notice the change to a slower GPRS network as an E icon on the top status bar of the screen.
