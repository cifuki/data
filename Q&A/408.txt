Q:How to change the font in a TextView, as default it's shown up as Arial? How to change it to Helvetica?

A:First, the default is not Arial. The default is Droid Sans.

Second, to change to a different built-in font, use android:typeface in layout XML or setTypeface() in Java.

Third, there is no Helvetica font in Android. The built-in choices are Droid Sans (sans), Droid Sans Mono (monospace), and Droid Serif (serif). While you can bundle your own fonts with your application and use them via setTypeface(), bear in mind that font files are big and, in some cases, require licensing agreements (e.g., Helvetica, a Linotype font).

EDIT


  The Android design language relies on traditional typographic tools
  such as scale, space, rhythm, and alignment with an underlying grid.
  Successful deployment of these tools is essential to help users
  quickly understand a screen of information. To support such use of
  typography, Ice Cream Sandwich introduced a new type family named
  Roboto, created specifically for the requirements of UI and
  high-resolution screens.
  
  The current TextView framework offers Roboto in thin, light, regular
  and bold weights, along with an italic style for each weight. The
  framework also offers the Roboto Condensed variant in regular and bold
  weights, along with an italic style for each weight.


After ICS, android includes Roboto fonts style,

  With the advent of Support Library 26, Android now supports custom fonts by 
  default. You can insert new fonts in res/fonts which can be set to TextViews individually either in XML or programmatically. The default font for the whole application can also be changed by defining it styles.xml The android developer documentation has a clear guide on this here
