Q:I am experiencing a very wired problem since this evening.

If I have any errors in my android project, and build is failed, then my Android studio gets frozen / stuck. I cant do anything but kill the Android studio application.
Even if I open the same project next time, gradle will try to build and freezes again. [Please find attached screen shot]

Only solution I could find is .... I have to find what exactly cause the "build fail" and I will have to resolve the issue using some other editor, and then my android studio will start working.

Thing is it was working without any issues till this evening; and suddenly broken down. Any one else having the same issue ??

A:If you are using Android Studio v1.2.1.1 or newer and you are using Macbook, I've recently seen that if your device is connected to your laptop (by usb have no idea about over the wifi) and you sleep your laptop then login again, Android Studio hang. Therefore, you need to unplug usb cable then you should see Android studio is happy and then reconnect your usb cable.
