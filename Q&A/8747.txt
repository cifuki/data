Q:I have a database with some tables. 
I want to update the tables using multiple threads.
I will use same instance of SQLiteDatabase in all threads.

Please suggest if this approach is correct.
Is Sqlite database threadsafe?
Can two different threads update same table for different set of values at same time.

A:[WRONG:] No, it is not thread-safe by default. You shoud use locking-related SQLiteHelper methods to provide thread safety.


  [EDIT]: SQLiteDatabase class provides a locking mechanism by default (see comments) and if you are running on multithread, you don't have to consider changing anything to have thread-safety.
