Q:Im adding images to a folder on the SDCARD.
Since the images and my folder is not immediately visible in the Gallery im
trying to get the MediaScannerConnection to update and show the
folder/images in the gallery.
This is not working so good for me since nothing shows up in Gallery.
Im only testing in Eclipse AVD.

I dont see much talk about this maybe because the scanFile is new since api8.
Could someone show how this is done?

Im trying it in both a service and Activity but keep getting 
uri=null when onScanCompleted.

            + Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory())));
