Q:I've tried compiling libreoffice core project (choosing Android module) (with make, no Gradle involved yet), and I'm getting this error:

/home/aleksandar/libreoffice/workdir/UnpackedTarball/owncloud_android_lib/build.xml:90: 
Cannot find /home/aleksandar/Android/Sdk/tools/ant/build.xml imported from /home/aleksandar/libreoffice/workdir/UnpackedTarball/owncloud_android_lib/build.xml


When looking through my SDK, I realized that /Sdk/tools/ant folder doesn't even exist. Is this the way that it should be?

I'm not sure why it causes that error now, especially that I've built the project many times without any problems. The only thing that I'm aware of that was changed is that I've updated all the tools (SDK and NDK). Was there any backwards compatibility-breaking change in those around the time of posting this (March 2017)? It may be the change in the source code that introduced the bug, but I'm sure it would be noticed already, and this is going on for a couple of days... Did anyone encounter a similar issue?
