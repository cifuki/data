Q:I am developing the application in HTML which is calling the console.log() from Javascript to provide me logs during the development about what happens in the web page code.

Unfortunately when I use the adb logcat command to check logs I can see output from all other applications, but not the output from my JavaScript code. I can see even the log from web browser that the page is loaded, but not console.log() output from my JavaScript code executed in the web browser.

According to information on this page (http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/debugging.html) it should work.

I am testing on HTC WildFire and HTC Desire HD.



Edited after more then 6 months

After some time and experience with different devices (phones, TVs, set top boxes, WebViews, UIWebViews...) my advice is to do the remote logging from JavaScript and not relying on the console.log() or other methods - see the nice trick with the image loading here.

Hope this helps!

A:In the default browser on Android 2.3.3 (and presumably from then on) you can simply use the built in javascript console:


open the browser
go to your webpage
type about:debug in the address bar and hit enter
you'll see a section for debug options appear if you go into the browser app's settings
tick "Show JavaScript Console" if not already enabled
refresh your webpage


At the top, you'll see a bar labeled "JavaScript Console".
