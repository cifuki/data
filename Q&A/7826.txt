Q:I am going to start using reactive programming in my Android project. I am using Kotlin as primary language and now I would like to apply Rx. My first choice was RxAndroid but then I noticed that there is RxKotlin.

As far as I know both are forked from RxJava so RxAndroid probably provides some API for android common tasks. On the other hand RxKotlin support lambas out of the box and allow me avoiding mixing kotlin with java.

Which one is preferred library in that case?

A:You could use both of them. 
RxKotlin contains an extension functions that provides to you idiomatic way(with writing less code) of using rxJava in Kotlin.
rxAndroid(is now split in few libraries) provides specific platform bindings such as: 


rxAndroid that could help you to manage an execution with native android Handlers 
rxLifecycle that provides Activity lifecycle bindings 
rxBinding and rxBinding-kotlin that helps to manage UI with all power of rxJava


There are few more useful libraries for rxJava and Android you could be interested.
