Q:I am starting to develop Android applications. Which version of Eclipse should I use?

I see there are 11 versions. I am confused with these:


Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
Eclipse Classic 3.6.1
Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers
Pulsar for Mobile Developers

A:Update July 2017:

From ADT Plugin page, the question must be unasked:

The Eclipse ADT plugin is no longer supported, as per this announcement in June 2015.

The Eclipse ADT plugin has many known bugs and potential security bugs that will not be fixed.

You should immediately switch to use Android Studio, the official IDE for Android. For help transitioning your projects, read Migrate to Android Studio.
