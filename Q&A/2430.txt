Q:I'm trying to find a command on Android Studio to convert a selected text to uppercase but I'm unable to do so.

Is there any shortcut for this? I think it is a very common action on IDE but haven't found any clue yet.

A:Select the text, then go to Edit â†’ Toggle Case (Ctrl+Shift+U on Windows).
