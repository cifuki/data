Q:I followed this guide 
https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/unit-testing-support
but i am stuck with this error:

junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Exception in constructor: testSaveJson (java.lang.RuntimeException: Method put in org.json.JSONObject not mocked. See https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/unit-testing-support for details.


I modified by Gradle build like the guide says but it doesn't make a difference

 testOptions { 
    unitTests.returnDefaultValues = true
  }

A:JSON is bundled up with the Android SDK, so you'll just be hitting a stub. You can pull in a JSON jar, which will provide real objects to use.

To do this, you'll need to add this to your build.gradle:

testImplementation 'org.json:json:20140107'

Alternatively, you can download and include the jar.

testCompile files('libs/json.jar')


Note that the latest version of JSON is built for Java 8, so you'll need to grab 20140107
