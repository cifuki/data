Q:I'm using ListActivity with my own ArrayAdapter class. When I override the methods ArrayAdapter.areAllItemsEnabled() and ArrayAdapter.isEnabled() the divider between some cells in the list view disappear. Does anyone know how to avoid this? I need the dividers to display even for disabled cells.

A:Return true in areAllItemsEnabled() and false in isEnabled for specific item. The disabled item wont be clickable but you will still be able to view the divider lines 

Note: This doesn't work for Android 5
