Q:So I have a problem with memory allocation. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I've read this thread and tried the advice there multiple times. Sometimes -Xms512m -Xmx768m works, sometimes -Xms256m -Xmx512m. I'm sick and tired of having to tweak this setting in IntelliJ under the Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle VM options setting. Is there no setting that solves this once and for all?

I have 16GB of RAM on my Windows 7 computer, I'm running IntelliJ IDEA EAP 14 build 138.2210.3, 64 bit version. Android Gradle build plugin v0.12. 

I'm suspecting gradle is not running in 64 bit mode, or else it would have ~7 GB of free memory to eat from. Why is it not utilizing this?

EDIT:

I got the same error in Visual Studio 2015 with cordova 5.1.1 under Windows 10. 
See my solution below.

A:I got the same error in Visual Studio 2015 with cordova 5.1.1 under Windows 10.

To solve the issue, set this environment variable:

_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx512M



Right click on start-button and open "System"
Search for "Advanced system settings" and open it
Click the button "Environment Variables ..." 
In System Variables, click "New..." 
New Variable Name: _JAVA_OPTIONS 
New Variable Value: -Xmx512M
Click OK
Restart Visual Studio, so the variable is picked up


This Article point me in the right direction. I did change the instructions a littel bit, so they fits to Windows 10.

Hope it helps someone!
