Q:I am trying to figure out a way to be able to change my application's app name per build type in gradle. 

For instance, I would like the debug version to have <APP_NAME>-debug and the qa version to have <APP-NAME>-QA. 

I am familiar with:

debug {
        applicationIdSuffix '.debug'
        versionNameSuffix '-DEBUG'
}


However, I can't seem to find a gradle command to apply the change of the app when in the launcher.

A:If by "app name", you mean android:label on <application>, the simplest solution is to have that point at a string resource (e.g., android:label="@string/app_name"), then have a different version of that string resource in a src/debug/ sourceset.

You can see that in this sample project, where I have a replacement for app_name in src/debug/res/values/strings.xml, which will be applied for debug builds. release builds will use the version of app_name in src/main/.
