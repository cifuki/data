Q:I downloaded Android Studio, fixed the JDK Environmental Variable, but when I try to create a New Project, I get an error that says


  Your Android SDK is out of date or is missing templates. Please ensure you are using SDK version 22 or later.


I opened up android.bat in the SDK but it said I was already running version 22.

Anyone else getting this?

A:It just happened because you already have your SDK setted up for Android Developers Bundle with eclipse. Simply open your SDK manager in the ADT Bundle and update you Android SDK Tools from 21.1 to 22 and you are good to go.

Worked for me.
