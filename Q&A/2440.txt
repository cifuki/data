In an Android string resource, how do I enforce a space?

For example, when I do " result" rather than "result" I still see "result" in my application's text view.

A:Did you try to surround your string with quotes? Maybe leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped automatically.

<string name="foo">" bar"</string>


See the example at https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#FormattingAndStyling in section "Escaping apostrophes and quotes".
