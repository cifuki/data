Q:I have some code that compiles successfully using ViewTreeObserver#removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(...) and when it runs, this method throws NoSuchMethodError.  Why?

A:There are two methods in ViewTreeObserver with almost the same name.

removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener victim)

(on then global) is a method that was added in API 16.  It replaces

removeGlobalOnLayoutListener(ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener victim)

(global then on) which has existed since API 1, but which is now deprecated.

Both methods can appear present at compile-time (if you're building against Jellybean or higher) but the newer one will fail on pre-Jellybean devices.

This code thwarts the error:

try {
    thing.removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(victim);
} catch (NoSuchMethodError x) {
    thing.removeGlobalOnLayoutListener(victim);
}


So does this code:

if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN) {
    thing.removeGlobalOnLayoutListener(victim);
} else {
    thing.removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(victim);
}
