Q:Is there an existing possibility to trigger the share functionality in local browsers on smartphones via HTML or JavaScript?

Of course there are many services which provide a share button. But when I e.g. want to share a website on facebook, I need to be logged in to facebook in the browser I am currently using.

Almost all browsers got an own share functionality build in, which triggers a system menu to choose which app you want to use to share:



This question is about: How to trigger this menu?

I know it is possible to trigger a phone call with a specified prefix in href attribute of links, like tel: or callto:. Maybe such a shortcut for this share menu is also existing? Or some javascript code? Or a totally different way how to do it?

Thanks in advance.

A:To my knowledge, there is no such implementation in current browsers on mobile OS's. Since the question interested me - a google search revealed there is work being done in this direction:

Sorry - I do not know a workaround.
