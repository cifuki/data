Q:I am using a webview to present some formatted stuff in my app. For some interaction (which are specific to certain dom elements) I use javascript and WebView.addJavascriptInterface(). Now, I want to recognize a long touch. Unfortunately, onLongTouch, in Android 2.3 the handles for text selection are displayed. 

How can I turn off this text selection without setting the onTouchListener and return true? (Then, the interaction with the "website" doesn't work anymore.

A:This worked for me

mWebView.setOnLongClickListener(new OnLongClickListener() {
    @Override
    public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
        return true;
    }
});
mWebView.setLongClickable(false);


I have not tested, if you don't want the vibration caused by the long click, you can try this:

mWebView.setHapticFeedbackEnabled(false);
