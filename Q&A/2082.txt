Q:Html List tag not working in android TextView. This is my string content:

String str="A dressy take on classic gingham in a soft, textured weave of stripes that resembles twill.  Take a closer look at this one.<ul><li>Trim, tailored fit for a bespoke feel</li><li>Medium spread collar, one-button mitered barrel cuffs</li><li>Applied placket with genuine mother-of-pearl buttons</li><li>;Split back yoke, rear side pleats</li><li>Made in the U.S.A. of 100% imported cotton.</li></ul>";


I loaded it in a text view like this:

textview.setText(Html.fromHtml(str));


The output looks like a paragraph. What can I do? Is there any solution for it?

Edit:

webview.loadData(str,"text/html","utf-8");

A:As you can see in the Html class source code, Html.fromHtml(String) does not support all HTML tags. In this very case, <ul> and <li> are not supported.

From the source code I have built a list of allowed HTML tags:


br
p
div
em
b
strong
cite
dfn
i
big
small
font
blockquote
tt
monospace
a
u
sup
sub


So you better use WebView and its loadDataWithBaseURL method. Try something like this:

String str="<html><body>A dressy take on classic gingham in a soft, textured weave of stripes that resembles twill.  Take a closer look at this one.<ul><li>Trim, tailored fit for a bespoke feel</li><li>Medium spread collar, one-button mitered barrel cuffs</li><li>Applied placket with genuine mother-of-pearl buttons</li><li>;Split back yoke, rear side pleats</li><li>Made in the U.S.A. of 100% imported cotton.</li></ul></body></html>";
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL(null, str, "text/html", "utf-8", null);
