Q:Description: I am using Google maps API V2.I have implemented Android Reverse Geocoding at touched location.

Problem: It throws exception on 

 try {
     addresses = geocoder.getFromLocation(latitude, longitude,1);}
 catch (IOException e)
     {
     e.printStackTrace();
     if(AppConstants.DEBUG)Log.v(AppConstants.DEBUG_TAG," e.printStackTrace(): "+e.getMessage());
     }


I am receiving latitude and longitude values correct, but i can't understand why it throws exception and i have also done Google search but it couldn't help.

Can anybody please explain in details??

A:As stated in this Android issue 38009 - Geocoder throwing exception: IOException: Service not Available Rebooting the Device will solve the problem
