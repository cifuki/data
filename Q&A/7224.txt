Q:I want to run some Runnable in a background thread. I want to use Handler because it's convenient for delays.
What I mean is

handler.post(runnable, delay);


Where runnable should be run in background Thread.
Is it possible to create such Handler?
Is there a "background" Looper somewhere or how can I create it?

P.S. I know how to do it with a custom class extends Thread but it requires a little more coding effort than doing it the handler way. So please don't post other solutions or something like

handler.post(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        new Thread() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                //action
            }
        }.start();
    }
});


I just wander if Handler can do it the "clean" way.

A:You can simply do this:

private Handler mHandler;

private HandlerThread mHandlerThread;

public void startHandlerThread(){
    mHandlerThread = new HandlerThread("HandlerThread");
    mHandlerThread.start();
    mHandler = new Handler(mHandlerThread.getLooper());
}


Then invoke with:

mHandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
          // Your task goes here
        }
    },1000);
