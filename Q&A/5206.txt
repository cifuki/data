Q:I set the c:/android-sdk/tools path to the path environment and commands like emulator is working just fine. But the adb command is still not recognized, what should I do ?

In the path system variable I added the android-sdk path and the tools path so far. Is there something else that needs to be done? Because commands like adb devices do not work. It says that the command is not recognized. By the way I want to do adb install comeapp.apk.

Thanks

A:If you go to your android-sdk/tools folder I think you'll find a message :


  The adb tool has moved to platform-tools/
  
  If you don't see this directory in your SDK,
  launch the SDK and AVD Manager (execute the android tool)
  and install "Android SDK Platform-tools"
  
  Please also update your PATH environment variable to
  include the platform-tools/ directory, so you can
  execute adb from any location.


So you should also add C:/android-sdk/platform-tools to you environment path. Also after you modify the PATH variable make sure that you start a new CommandPrompt window.
