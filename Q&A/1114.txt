Q:I want to write some debugging output to the log to review it with logcat. 

If I write something to System.out this is already displayed in logcat.

What is the clean way to write to the log and add levels and tags to my output?

A:Look into android.util.Log.  It lets you write to the log with various log levels, and you can specify different tags to group the output. 
For example 

Log.w("myApp", "no network");


will output a warning with the tag myApp and the message no network.
