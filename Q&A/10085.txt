Q:Gradle build-info.xml not found for module app. Please make sure that you are using gradle plugin gradle:2.0.0-alpha or greater


I'm using the gradle plug in gradle:2.0.0-beta2. I randomly get this warning and after this very often either the app is not updated or it crashes.
It is enough to clean and rebuild to fix the issue.

Is there any better way to fix it?

A:For me it happens on the Mac, but on Windows it works fine all the time. Ever since I updated Android Studio to version 2.0 beta, the issue was still present until official 2.0 Android Studio version.

What helped was disabling Instant Run in Android Studio -> Preferences (search for "instant run" or) -> "Build, Execution, Deployment" -> Instant Run -> Enable Instant Run -> turn off
