Q:What causes following problem? Is my Android SDK Version not supported?

Starting JS server...                                                                     
Building and installing the app on the device (cd android && gradlew.bat installDebug)...

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

A:Probably you need to update your Build Tools.

I faced the problem when I tried to update from the graphic interface, it didn't show the exact minor version, so I couldn't update to it.

It was solved by looking at the available versions from the terminal with:

android list sdk -a




[...]
Packages available for installation or update: 156
1- Android SDK Tools, revision 24.4
2- Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 23.0.1
3- Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 23.1 rc1
4- Android SDK Build-tools, revision 23.0.1


[...]

And installing the right version with:

android update sdk -a -u -t 4
