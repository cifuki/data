A:To add an Activity using Android Studio.

This step is same as adding Fragment, Service, Widget, and etc.. Screenshots provided.

[UPDATE] In Android Studio 0.5.4


In your Main Application project, go to your src folder. 


Double click the src to expand.


Right click main or java folder. New > Activity.





[Android studio 0.5.3 and below]


On your project, go to java folder (src > main) > right click either the java folder or a package name > New > Android Component.
Now, the next step would be easy for you. Cheers! :)


To add a Service, Application, Remote Interface or a BroadcastReceiver, just do the same step.
