Q:Before coming to the problem let me explain what I did that has landed me in the problem.


I created an account on github and made a repository named Android.
Then I installed github client in my windows 7.
Then I opened this client, provided my authentication and cloned the repository to a local directory C:\\Users\\Aniket\\Documents\\GitHub\\Android(This folder has the .git folder in it).
Then I went to my Eclipse ADT and installed EGit plugin as described here. Also I  
Then in Eclipse I right click on my project TicTacToe go to Team->Share Project and provide my repository path i.e C:\\Users\\Aniket\\Documents\\GitHub\\Android.
My Project was added to the local repository and in my github client it shows me all option to commit file in the actual repository on the github site.
But my project is suddenly showing error with a red '!' sign on it. 

Description --> Archive for required library: 'C:/Users/Aniket/AndroidWorkspace/TicTacToe
/libs/android-support-v4.jar' in project 'TicTacToe' cannot be read or is not a valid ZIP file

Resource     --> TicTacToe

Path Location --> Build path    

Type --> Build Path Problem


Note : the Error was a single line displayed in error console on Eclipse. I just split it up for readability.

Even after detaching repository it shows that error.

Has anyone encountered this scenario before. What is the solution or workaround? I googled and first few links suggest it is an Eclipse bug. Please suggest what can be done to bring my project back to executable state?

A:It is an Eclipse bug. I have faced the similar problem several times. closing and reopening the project works sometime. if it doesn't work try restarting Eclipse.
