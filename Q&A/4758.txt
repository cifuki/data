Q:I had written method to get the pixels from dip but it is not working. It give me runtime error.

Actually I was running this method in separate class and initialized in my Activity class 

Board board = new Board(this);
board.execute(URL);


This code run asynchronously. Please help me.

 public float getpixels(int dp){

        //Resources r = boardContext.getResources();
        //float px = (int)TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, dpis, r.getDisplayMetrics());

         final float scale = this.boardContext.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;
            int px = (int) (dp * scale + 0.5f);



        return px;

    }

A:The formula is: px = dp * (dpi / 160), for having on a 160 dpi screen. See http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html for more information.

You could try: 

public static int convertDipToPixels(float dips)
{
    return (int) (dips * appContext.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density + 0.5f);
}


Hope this helps...
