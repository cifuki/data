Q:is related to:

Need suggestion about a mixed "Uri / int id" images ambient

now my problem is that:

ImageView imgView=(ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imgView);
Uri imgUri=Uri.parse("android.resource://my.package.name/"+R.drawable.image);
imageView.setImageURI(imgUri);


does NOT work . why?

i know that

imgView.setImageDrawable(Drawable.createFromStream(
                    getContentResolver().openInputStream(imgUri),
                    null));


work.

but that does NOT solve my problem. because I want to set the image with an uri independenty if this come from a resource or come from the camera ACTION_PICK intent...

any suggestions are welcome.
Thank you.
Regards

A:Try this

Uri imgUri=Uri.parse("android.resource://my.package.name/"+R.drawable.image);
imageView.setImageURI(null); 
imageView.setImageURI(imgUri);


This is a workaround for refreshing an ImageButton, which tries to cache the previous image Uri. Passing null effectively resets it.
