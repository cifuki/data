Q:All over the net I see examples like edittext.getText().toString(). I do not see any null check. In docs I do not see any statement that would say that this will never be null.

Still, what does the observations say; does this ever return null?

A:getText() will not return null. So there is no chance for NPE in following method. the getText will return empty string if there is no string, which is definitely not null

getText().toString();


However the edittext itself can be null if not initialized properly, Hence the following will trigger NPE

editText.getText().toString();
