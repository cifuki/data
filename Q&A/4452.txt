Q:Since moving to ADK14, I have been unable to build new apks for release on my Windows 7 system.

Building fails with "conversion to dalvik format failed with error 1", while the console is filled with lots of "Dx bad class file magic (cafebabe) or version (0033.0000)".

The full exception text:

com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.internal.build.DexException: Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1

I am building an old project that uses lots of libraries, so presumably the problem is related to this fact. Already done all the "Fix Properties"/Clean etc that are suggested when moving to ADK14 (as I naturally had all those problems), but they haven't helped with this.

All the libraries are on the same Android SDK and JDK/JRE version, so this wouldn't seem to be the issue.And in fact, the app is easily built in debug and installed on my old version 1.5 HTC Magic - it is only when I need to export a signed application package that this breaks down.

[Edit]
This is on a Windows 7x64 PC. I observe that packing the apk on my Linux laptop (Lucid Lynx) for the exact same code has absolutely no problems whatsoever.

Any ideas? Getting very frustrated with this.

NOTE

Apparently, this error message can be triggered by a variety of different problems. My particular problem was not related to Java 6/7, as I never installed Java 7 in the first place, and compiler compliance was set to Java 6 (I checked at the time, as I had seen that solution suggested elsewhere).

A:Compiling with Java 6 instead of 7 worked for me, but only after I configured Eclipse to "know about" my JRE6 install path.  Previously I only had the JRE7 set up in Eclipse.  I could set my compiler compliance level to 1.6 or 1.5 but apparently without the corresponding JRE it didn't really have any effect.  I don't really understand why that should be--what does the JRE have to do with compiling, and what does it have to do with Android code?
