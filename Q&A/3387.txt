Q:Configuration:


Windows 8.1
ADB version: 1.0.32
Smartphone: Oneplus One


Problem

I installed the Samsung drivers as it is said to do. When I run the ADB devices command, it said unauthorized.

Already tried:


I've done everything that'd been said on this post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25546300/1848376

But the problem is that I don't get a prompt on the phone to tell me I must accept the connection.
When I run the command adb shell, here is the answer:

error: device unauthorized.
This adbd's $ADB_VENDOR_KEYS is not set; try 'adb kill-server' if that seems wrong.
Otherwise check for a confirmation dialog on your device.



I did "adb kill-server", but it didn't change anything. Why?
