Q:I'm trying to implement a layout which contains RecyclerView and ScrollView at the same layout.

Layout template: 

<RelativeLayout>
    <ScrollView android:id="@+id/myScrollView">
       <unrelated data>...</unrealated data>

           <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:id="@+id/my_recycler_view"
            />
    </ScrollView>


</RelativeLayout>


Problems: i can scroll until the last element of ScrollView

Things i tried: 


card view inside the ScrollView (now ScrollView contains RecyclerView) - can see the card up until the RecyclerView
initial thought was to implement this viewGroup using RecyclerView instead of ScrollView where one of it's views type is the CardView but i got the exact same results as with the ScrollView

A:use NestedScrollView instead of ScrollView

Please go through NestedScrollView reference document for more information.

and add recyclerView.setNestedScrollingEnabled(false); to your RecyclerView
