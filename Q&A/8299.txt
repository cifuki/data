Q:i need to load a image from assets to avoid a froyo 2.2.2 bug resizing POT images in some particular cases. The way to avoid it is loading the image files from assets dir.

I'm trying to do with this:

        String imagePath = "radiocd5.png";
    AssetManager mngr = context.getAssets();
    // Create an input stream to read from the asset folder
    InputStream is=null;
    try {
        is = mngr.open(imagePath);
    } catch (IOException e1) {  e1.printStackTrace();}

    //Get the texture from the Android resource directory
    //InputStream is = context.getResources().openRawResource(R.drawable.radiocd5);
    Bitmap bitmap = null;
    try {
        //BitmapFactory is an Android graphics utility for images
        bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);

    } finally {
        //Always clear and close
        try {
            is.close();
            is = null;
        } catch (IOException e) {
        }
    }


But i am getting NullPointerException on the line is.close();

i capture a FileNotFoundException: radiocd5.png, but that file is on my assets directory :S

What am i doing bad? The file is called radiocd5.png and it is on the assets directory

A:You can follow my tutorials on displaying data from Assets: https://xjaphx.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/store-and-use-files-in-assets/ 
The sample with loading image and text to display.

I now added the relevant part of the provided link 
(in case of earthquake or something) ;-) Taifun

// load image
try {
    // get input stream
    InputStream ims = getAssets().open("avatar.jpg");
    // load image as Drawable
    Drawable d = Drawable.createFromStream(ims, null);
    // set image to ImageView
    mImage.setImageDrawable(d);
}
catch(IOException ex) {
    return;
}
