Q:I am trying to build my first app with react-native.

I am following these 2 tutorial:


https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html


I am sure that I installed all the requirements from the second link but when I try running my app with react-native run-android, I get the following error:



I executed this command while running genymotion.

This is all that I have installed in Android SDK:





I tried to install Android build tools 23.0.1 but I get this error:



What should I do?

A:I faced the same problem and I solved it doing the following:

Go to /home/[USER]/Android/Sdk/tools
and execute:


  $android list sdk -a


Which will show a list like:


Android SDK Tools, revision 24.0.2
Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 23.0.2
Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 23.0.1


... and many more

Then, execute the command (attention! at your computer the third option may be different):


  $android update sdk -a -u -t 3


It will install the 23.0.1 SDK Platform-tools components.

Try to build your project again.
