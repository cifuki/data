Q:I have a scenario in which I have Player types ARCHER,WARRIOR, and sorcerer.
What should I use in Player class for a player type?
Constant final static String variable or an Enum? and Why?
Please help with reasons.

A:Suppose you use constant strings (or int values - the same goes for them):

// Constants for player types
public static final String ARCHER = "Archer";
public static final String WARRIOR = "Warrior";

// Constants for genders
public static final String MALE = "Male";
public static final String FEMALE = "Female";


then you end up not really knowing the type of your data - leading to potentially incorrect code:

String playerType = Constants.MALE;


If you use enums, that would end up as:

// Compile-time error - incompatible types!
PlayerType playerType = Gender.MALE;


Likewise, enums give a restricted set of values:

String playerType = "Fred"; // Hang on, that's not one we know about...


vs

PlayerType playerType = "Fred"; // Nope, that doesn't work. Bang!


Additionally, enums in Java can have more information associated with them, and can also have behaviour. Much better all round.
