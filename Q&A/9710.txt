Q:I am new to kotlin, i have converted some code from java but it seems like there's something wrong, The R in findViewById(R.id.my_id) is highlighted in red and it shows this message : "Unresolved reference: R".. I've been looking for a solution but i seem not to figure it out, So what should i do?
Here's a screenshot :

A:I used com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0-alpha13 and had the same issue. Changing to stable Version 3.2.1 solved this problem for me.
