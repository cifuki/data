Q:I'm having an issues where System.getenv() is returning null for the environment variable. My password is stored in the RELEASE_PASSWORD environment variable. When I do:

$ echo $RELEASE_PASSWORD

it prints out the correct value, so I know the variable is set.

I was originally setting the signingConfig signingConfigs.release in the release buildType and everything was working fine, but I need different signing configs for different product flavors. If I hardcode the password, it works just like it is suppose to. Things only get wonky when I try to read the password from an environment variable.

Is it some sort of scope issue?

This is what I currently have in my build.gradle.

android {

  ...

  signingConfigs {
    release {
      storeFile ...;
      keyAlias ...;
      storePassword System.getenv("RELEASE_PASSWORD");
      keyPassword System.getenv("RELEASE_PASSWORD");
    }

    unsigned {
      keyAlias "";
      storePassword "";
      keyPassword "";
    }
  }

  buildTypes {
    debug {
      versionNameSuffix = "-DEBUG"
    }

    release {
    }
  }

  flavorGroups "storeFront"

  productFlavors {
    def googleVariable = signingConfigs.release
    def amazonVariable = signingConfigs.unsigned

    google {
        flavorGroup "storeFront"
        signingConfig googleVariable
    }

    amazon {
        flavorGroup "storeFront"
        signingConfig amazonVariable
    }
  }
}

A:Android Studio doesn't pass environment variables to Gradle, so what you're trying to do won't work from the IDE. If you want a way to avoid keeping the keystore password in the build file, here's an answer with code for saving it in a separate file:

Sign APK without putting keystore info in build.gradle
