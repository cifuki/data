A:Steps (These apply for Linux. For other OS, visit here) -


Copy the apk file to platform-tools in android-sdk linux folder.
Open Terminal and navigate to platform-tools folder in android-sdk.
Then Execute this command - 


  ./adb install FileName.apk

If the operation is successful (the result is displayed on the screen), then you will find your file in the launcher of your emulator.
