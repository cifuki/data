Q:Im trying to use ListUtils
but when I ran the app I got this error:

 Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "org.apache.commons.collections.ListUtils" on path: DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/com.meridianaspect.wiw-2/base.apk"],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/vendor/lib, /system/lib]]


So I guess I have to import that library via gradle somehow, but I dont know how to do that?

A:Place the jar file in the libs folder in the root of your module. Then File -> Project Settings. In the left side choose the module where you want to add this lib, in the right side choose tab Dependencies. In the bottom press Plus sign and click File dependency. Then choose your jar and sync project
