Q:I have a DatePicker and a TimePicker in my app. Can anyone tell me how to get the values of the date and time that are selected??? What i mean to say is, for EditText we can declare as 

final EditText name = (EditText) this.findViewById(R.id.nametext);


and we can cast the data of it by using name.getText().toString().

So similarly how can we get the values of DatePicker and TimePicker to a String???

A:DatePicker has 

getYear() 
getMonth() 
getDayOfMonth()


to make a Date object from a DatePicker you'd do new Date(datePicker.getYear() - 1900, datePicker.getMonth(), datePicker.getDayOfMonth());

Note that this constructor was deprecated in API level 1 - please refer to andrescanavesi's answer for a more appropriate way of creating a Date object.

TimePicker has

getCurrentHour()
getCurrentMinute()
