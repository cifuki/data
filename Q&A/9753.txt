Q:I know that I can run Perl on Android, but I'm looking to write an app that can be released on Google Play, for anyone to download and run. Is Perl still a viable choice?

A:This Google project packages Perl scripts and Perl into a self-contained APK, not requiring any further downloads, that can be uploaded to Google Play:

http://code.google.com/p/perl-android-apk/

It provides Android API access through SL4A - see the following page by one of the authors:

So yes, Perl is a viable option if it's your preferred language to work with.
