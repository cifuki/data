Q:I updated to gradle 4.0.1 and started receiving following error


  The library com.google.android.gms:play-services-measurement-base is
  being requested by various other libraries at [[15.0.4,15.0.4]], but
  resolves to 15.0.2. Disable the plugin and check your dependencies
  tree using ./gradlew :app:dependencies.


My project doesn't use that dependency so I searched globally for it, and it it only comes up inside


  build/intermediates/lint-cache/maven.google/com/google/android/gms/group-index.xml


as this line

<play-services-measurement-base versions="15.0.0,15.0.2"/>


So I tried deleting my build folder and cleaning the project, but it regenerates it with same values :/ hence error still remains

A:The actual problem is discussed in the May, 23rd release note of https://developers.google.com/android/guides/releases#may_23_2018

Basically, you need to bump all Play Services and Firebase libraries to their latest version (which may be different for each since version 15).
You may use https://mvnrepository.com/ to find the latest version for each library.
