Q:I have an AutoCompleteTextView in my app which works. I have successfully created an onClickItemListener. The question is how to grab the text the user selected.

And this is the thing: I have an ArrayList with words being passed to the Adapter to search for suggestions. As the user types a word the suggestions list gets shorter (in rows on the UI side) so when i want to get the word from the ArrayList at the index the user selected i get the wrong word because the indexes doesn't match.

How can I get the text (String) the user chose without having to mess with the index?

Here's my code:

public class AutocompleteActivity extends BaseActivity {

    private DBManager m_db;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.autocomplete);

        m_db = new DBManager(this);
        final ArrayList<String> words = m_db.selectAllWords();
        ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, R.layout.listitem, words);

        AutoCompleteTextView tv = (AutoCompleteTextView)findViewById(R.id.autocomplete);
        tv.setThreshold(1);
        tv.setAdapter(adapter);

        tv.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {

            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> arg0, View arg1, int arg2, long arg3) {
                Log.i("SELECTED TEXT WAS------->", words.get(arg2));
            }
        });
    }
}

A:arg0 being your AdapterView and arg2 the position.

Have you tried:

arg0.getItemAtPosition(arg2);
