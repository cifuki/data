Q:Is there any obfuscation tool to use with Android Studio? IntelliGuard plugin is declared to be supported by the Studio, but it doesn't work actually due to missing AntSupport plugin. I wan't able to find one in the repository. Any ideas?

P.S. Android Studio build process is based on Gradle, so I wouldn't expect to see Ant support there at all. May be I'm wrong.

A:Basic Obfuscation


To obfuscate code in Android studio just go to your build.gradle file in your Android Studio project:



Change the minifyEnabled property from false to true



That is a basic offuscation.

After generating the apk you can see the obfuscation result decompilating the apk with any software, for example this page could help you:

http://www.decompileandroid.com/

In the obfuscation result you will see classes with name: a,b,c....



And the obfuscation variables and methods will have also names like aa,c,ac...




Normal obfuscation:


To obfuscate the code in a more complex form you could go to your root directory app and create a .pro file, for example in the following picture I have create the file: proguard-rules-new.pro, in the same directory you should see a file called proguard-rules.pro



Now add the file you have created to the build.gradle file



And edit the .pro file you have create with your own custom proguard rules
