Q:I would like to see a 'Hello world' program written in C/C++ but made to run on Android.

I know this is possible by using NDK and JNI calls. But not able to make it work. No guides online are helpful.

Need to know to to get started.

I am developing on Windows 7 machine and also using Eclipse for ease.

Android installation path: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-sdk-windows
and NDK I have extracted to: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-ndk-r5


How do I import NDK to eclipse? 
How to use C/C++ in Android?


If I could get help running a simple 'hello world' I can design most of my sensitive code with C++.

A:There are samples in the android-ndk-r5 folder + there is a nice step-by-step tutorial:

No excuses, dude. You just have to read (take a look at the Exploring the hello-jni Sample section).
