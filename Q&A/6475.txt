Q:How can I get the ip address of my phone when it is connected under wifi?

I found a method here but it returns something like 24.182.239.255 even if I'm under wifi and I expect something like 192.168.1.10.

I'd like something like:

if (you are under wifi)
    String ip4 = getWifiIP()
else
    String ip4 = getIPAddress with the method linked before


Many thanks!

A:If you would like to get the private IP address of your device when connected to Wi-Fi, you can try this.

WifiManager wifiMgr = (WifiManager) getSystemService(WIFI_SERVICE);
WifiInfo wifiInfo = wifiMgr.getConnectionInfo();
int ip = wifiInfo.getIpAddress();
String ipAddress = Formatter.formatIpAddress(ip);


Be sure to add the permission 

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />


to your manifest.
