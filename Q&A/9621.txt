My problem is that when i run adb devices this error message is shown:


  adb server version (32) doesn't match this client (36); killing...
  error: could not install smartsocket listener: Address already in use
  ADB server didn't ACK
  * failed to start daemon *
  error: cannot connect to daemon


i tryed to set the sdk path in genymotion->Settings->adb but it didn't work.
