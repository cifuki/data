Q:I saw somewhere method to make RecyclerView show ViewHolders from bottom to top. Now, i can't find it anywhere (after half of hour going through RecyclerView, RecyclerAdapter, LayoutManager...).

A:Is it LinearLayoutManager.setStackFromEnd(true) you are looking for?

Edit

Turns out LinearLayoutManager.setReverseLayout(true) does the trick. Either way, the reader may want to try each of the methods and the combination of both to get the needed effect.
