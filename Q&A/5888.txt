Q:I've a problem I can't solve: inside a ScrollView I only have a
LinearLayout. By a user action I'm programmatically adding 2 TextView
on this LinearLayout, but by the default the scroll keeps on the top.
Since I controll the user action, I should be easy to scroll to the
bottom with something like:

ScrollView scroll = (ScrollView) this.findViewById(R.id.scroll);
scroll.scrollTo(0, scroll.getBottom());


But actually not. Because immediately after adding this two new
elements getBottom() still returns the previous two. I tried to
refresh the state invoking refreshDrawableState(), but I doesn't work.

Do you have any idea how could I get the actual bottom of a ScrollView
after adding some elements?

A:This doesn't actually answer your question.
But it's an alternative which pretty much does the same thing.

Instead of Scrolling to the bottom of the screen, change the focus to a view which is located at the bottom of the screen. 

That is, Replace:

scroll.scrollTo(0, scroll.getBottom());


with:

Footer.requestFocus();


Make sure you specify that the view, say 'Footer' is focusable.

android:focusable="true"
android:focusableInTouchMode="true"
