Q:When I launch my Android app with Eclipse, the usual window "Android Device Chooser" appears. I can here choose on which device I want to run my app.

In the target column appears next to my target an orange triangle with an exclamation mark (kind of 'warning') (see the image below)

Does somebody know what it means ?

A:According to this mailing list thread, that just means you're utilising an optional library and Eclipse can't be sure it's installed on the device. Eclipse knows you're using a compatible version of the API, it's just not sure about the optional extension you're using. So you should be fine, as long as the app works on the phone.
