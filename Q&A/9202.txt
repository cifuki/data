Exactly when is onAttach called during the Fragment-Activity lifecycles? 

I am aware of the Fragment Life-Cycle but exactly when?

Is it when the fragment object is initiated or when fragment manager is called?

A:In activity the first method is onCreate.
onCreate of activity add the fragment and in this moment onAttach is called. like in the picture
