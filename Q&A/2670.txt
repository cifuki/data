Q:Hey i was wondering do you need root to do this any more? I want to install/run apps over wireless to stop all this cable switching. I have also read that it can cause some errors though? That was on old posts on this site, I was wondering is it reliable and easy to do now?

A:Rooting is not required. With USB cable connected, port 5555 opened across all involved firewalls and debug mode enabled

adb tcpip 5555


then look into wireless properties of your device and the network you use, to see which IP address have been granted to device (or configure your DHCP always to use the same for the device mac address). Then

adb connect 192.168.1.133


(were 192.168.1.133 is a sample IP address).

This is all. You can now use adb shell or adb install or adb upload or the like with USB cable plugged out. 

To switch back to USB mode, 

adb usb


The device may also revert back to USB mode after reboot.

This mode is needed for development of applications that use attached USB devices directly (USB port is used by device so cannot be used by ADB). It is briefly covered in the USB debugging section of the Android website.
