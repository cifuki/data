Q:How can I make an ImageView appear in the middle of the screen when the user clicks a button? I have placed the image in the res/drawable-folder.

I've been trying with the code below but I don't know how to make the ImageView appear:

 View v = new ImageView(getBaseContext());
 ImageView image; 
 image = new ImageView(v.getContext()); 
 image.setImageDrawable(v.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.gameover));


Thanks!

A:Create the ImageView
Use an OnClickListener in the button
Add the ImageView to the layout or set the visibility of the ImageView to VISIBLE
