Q:cannot.find.zip.align=The zipalign tool was not found in the SDK.

Please update to the latest SDK and re-export your application
or run zipalign manually.

Aligning applications allows Android to use application resources
more efficiently.


This is the message I received when I tried to publish my app. I'm using the latest revision of Android SDK Tools (23 which was released today) and SDK Platform-tools (20 which was also released today). I got an APK out of it, but if I tried to upload it to Google Play I got an error complaining that it is not zip aligned.

Running zipalign manually fixes the apk, but does anyone know what causes this and how to fix it?

A:I had the same problem. 
And to fix it, I copy the Zipalign file from sdk/build-tools/android-4.4W folder to sdk/tools/

Edited: Since Google updated SDK for Android, new build-tools does fix this problem. So I encouraged everyone to update to Android SDK Build-tools 20 as suggested by Pang in the post below.
