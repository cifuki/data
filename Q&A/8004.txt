Q:I use keymaps in Android Studio to save time. 

To open "Recent Files" I happen to use the keymap of CMD+ E, which will open the "Recent Files" pop-up screen.

The problem is that when I then select any of the .xml layout files from this screen, it opens the file by default in "Design" mode, instead of "Text". 

I prefer to code my layouts in "Text" mode. This means I then have to keyboard shortcut CTRL+ SHIFT + -> every time to edit the layout in "Text" mode. How do I open "Text" mode by default. 

Note: I would post images, but that is reputation dependent...

A:Open Settings:

File -> Settings -> Editor -> Layout Editor -> check the checkbox "Prefer XML Editor"
