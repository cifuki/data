Q:I want to use these libraries in Android Studio:

import org.apache.http.HttpResponse;
import org.apache.http.client.HttpClient;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet;
import org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient;


I am following a video tutorial in which the tutor is using Eclipse so I know it works.

But what additional things/libraries do I have to add to Android Studio in order to use them?

A:HttpClient was deprecated in Android 5.1 and is removed from the Android SDK in Android 6.0. While there is a workaround to continue using HttpClient in Android 6.0 with Android Studio, you really need to move to something else. That "something else" could be:


the built-in classic Java HttpUrlConnection
Apache's independent packaging of HttpClient for Android
OkHttp (my recommendation)
AndroidAsync


Or, depending upon the nature of your HTTP work, you might choose a library that supports higher-order operations (e.g., Retrofit for Web service APIs).

In a pinch, you could enable the legacy APIs, by having useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy' in your android closure in your module's build.gradle file. However, Google has been advising people for years to stop using Android's built-in HttpClient, and so at most, this should be a stop-gap move, while you work on a more permanent shift to another API.
