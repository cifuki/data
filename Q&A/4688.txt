Q:Ok I'm looking right past something here..

Every time I'm in my app and I change activities, logcat reports series of warnings:

02-04 14:42:36.524: WARN/Resources(1832): Converting to string: TypedValue{t=0x12/d=0x0 a=2 r=0x7f08002b}
02-04 14:42:36.524: WARN/Resources(1832): Converting to string: TypedValue{t=0x12/d=0x0 a=2 r=0x7f08002c}
02-04 14:42:36.524: WARN/Resources(1832): Converting to string: TypedValue{t=0x12/d=0x0 a=2 r=0x7f08002d}


Other apps are not showing such warnings.  Is this a pre-release/aapt compression thing?

A:You are using a bool resource where a string is expected.

You can find which resource is being used incorrectly by opening your generated R.java file and searching for the resource IDs from the logcat message:

0x7f08002b
0x7f08002c
0x7f08002d


All three should be from your bool.xml file (the "t=0x12" in the warning message means the resources are TYPE_INT_BOOLEAN).

Then, find where those resource IDs are being used in your project (probably a layout xml, but could be anywhere) and make sure the types match.

Here's an example of a TextView that would generate that log message.  If in my res/values/bool.xml I have:

<resources>
    <bool name="foo_flag">false</bool>
</resources>


I can incorrectly refer to it from a a layout xml file:

<TextView android:id="@+id/foo"
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:text="@bool/foo_flag"></TextView>


When I run that app, I'll get the warning message since "text" expects a string resource, not a bool (my app appears as expected though since the flag is converted to the string "false").
