Q:I was wondering if it's possible to change the statusbar icons colour (not the statusbar colour, colorPrimaryDark)

Let's say I want this statusbar with:
<item name="colorPrimaryDark">@android:color/white</item>  

and the icons in black, is it possible?

Thanks.

EDIT:


  New in the M developer preview: windowLightStatusBar. Flipping this on
  in your theme tells the system to use a dark foreground, useful for
  lighter colored status bars. Note the M preview seems to have a bug
  where notification icons remain white, while system status icons
  correctly change to semitransparent black.

A:Not since Lollipop. Starting with Android 5.0, the guidelines say:


  Notification icons must be entirely white.


Even if they're not, the system will only consider the alpha channel of your icon, rendering them white

Workaround

The only way to have a coloured icon on Lollipop is to lower your targetSdkVersion to values <21, but I think you would do better to follow the guidelines and use white icons only.

If you still however decide you want colored icons, you could use the DrawableCompat.setTint method from the new v4 support library.
