Q:My application uses quite a lot of pictures that are downloaded from the internet and cached locally on the Android phone. I am wondering, what is the correct way to save those pictures. There are several ways I see, that are not fully satisfying.

Save them on SD Card in a public folder


Uses up space that wont be freed on uninstall
User can see pics in Gallery
Needs a folder on the sdcard root (you can actually see it while browsing your phone)


Save them on SD Card in a non-public folder


Uses up space that wont be freed on uninstall
Secretly uses space on the SD Card


Save them inside the application


Blows up application size far too much


What is the correct way of locally saving the images of my application to not distract the user and leave no garbage anywhere?

A:Your best solution is to use:

context.getCacheDir()


This directory is private to the application and will be deleted on uninstall, furthermore the system can delete from this directory for you if the device is running short of space.

Note though that the docs say:


  you should not rely on the system
  deleting these files for you; you
  should always have a reasonable
  maximum, such as 1 MB, for the amount
  of space you consume with cache files,
  and prune those files when exceeding
  that space


If you need a lot of space and would rather use the SD card you can call

getExternalCacheDir()


instead. These will also get removed on uninstall, but the system does not monitor the space available in external storage, so won't automatically delete these files if low on space. If using this option you should also check that external storage is available with

Environment.getExternalStorageState()


before attempting to write to it.
