Q:Recently I switched from support library to com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0

But now I have a problem, in this pages there's a note https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md


  Note: Using a Material Components theme enables a custom view inflater which replaces default components with their Material counterparts. Currently, this only replaces Button XML components with MaterialButton.


And the theme I am using 

Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar


does exactly what it says in that note, it replaces AlertDialog Buttons to MaterialButtons but the problem is that by default MaterialButtons are colored background and now the buttons looks like this: 

How can I make them borderless and backgroundless again?

PS I am using alert builder to create alert dialogs:

android.app.AlertDialog.Builder

A:I figured out what was causing this problem. I need to use different AlertDialog class:

androidx.appcompat.app.AlertDialog


When I switched to this everything started working as expected. Here's where I found the solution:
