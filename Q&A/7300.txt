Q:When I developed, I found a new widget called android.support.v7.widget.ButtonBarLayout unexpectedly. I tried to search it on the internet, but nothing was found, even on the official development documents site. 

In the meantime, I found two ButtonBarLayout when I search ButtonBarLayout everywhere in Android Studio, one is android.support.v7.widget.ButtonBarLayout and the other is com.android.internal.widget.ButtonBarLayout. I tried to read source codes of both, I found that they are the same except package name. So I thought maybe android.support.v7.widget.ButtonBarLayout came from com.android.internal.widget.ButtonBarLayout after the internal ButtonBarLayout was through tests and released. At the same time, ButtonBarLayout is inherited from LinearLayout.

But there are some question:


What can we get from ButtonBarLayout literally and how should we use it?
I noticed the variable of private boolean mAllowStacking. When it changes, orientation of this layout would be changed. But I didn't really understand what it is used for.


So does somebody know ButtonBarLayout well?

P.S.: I used Android Studio of 2.0.0 Preview 4 and Gradle Plugin of 2.0.0-alpha3 and Android Support Library of 23.1.1 and Platform-tools of 23.1 and Build-tools of 23.0.2.

A:The source code describes ButtonBarLayout as follows:

/**
 * An extension of LinearLayout that automatically switches to vertical
 * orientation when it can't fit its child views horizontally.
 */


So, in essence, it is nothing but a smart LinearLayout which manages auto-switching orientations based on available space on screen.

The same ButtonBarLayout.java file describes mAllowStacking in comments as follows:

/** Whether the current configuration allows stacking. */
