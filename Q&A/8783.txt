Q:In some web browsers, huge images are automatically resized to fit the screen.

Is it possible to do the same in an Android WebView?

The web page just contains the image, maybe adding some JavaScript could do the trick?
Anybody has already done this?

Note: I don't know the size of the image in advance.

A:Yes, it's possible. You can try setting the WebView Layout using the code below. It resizes all Images (Greater than the Device Screen Width) to the Screen Width. This works for both Orientations (Portrait and Landscape)

webview.getSettings().setLayoutAlgorithm(LayoutAlgorithm.SINGLE_COLUMN);


You can add extra margins/padding later to get the spacing right.
