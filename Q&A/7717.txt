Q:In Tim Bray's latest Android blog post he mentions the "dashboard" ui pattern (what is used for the Twitter app, Facebook app, etc.  Is this layout as simple as a GridView with Buttons or is it something else?

Update:

The DashboardLayout was released by Roman Nurik last night. It is a derivative of the layout used in the Google IO 2010 app.

A:The best example you can use is from the Google I/O 2011 Android App. They implement all those design patterns in their app. You can find the code at the following link:

The 2011 version uses a custom layout called 'DashboardLayout' in a fragment which gets shared in phone and tablet specific layouts. The logic in DashboardLayout is responsible for all the auto layout magic!
