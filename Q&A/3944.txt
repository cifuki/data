Q:I would like to monitor network traffic of my Android Phone. I was thinking using tcpdump for Android, but I'm not sure if I have to cross-compile for the phone.

Another question is the following, If I want to monitor the trafic data for a certain application, there's any command for doing that?

A:TCPDUMP is one of my favourite tools for analyzing network, but if you find difficult to cross-compile tcpdump for android, I'd recomend you to use some applications from the market.

These are the applications I was talking about:


Shark: Is small version of wireshark for Android phones). This program will create a *.pcap and you can read the file on PC with wireshark.
Shark Reader : This program allows you to read the *.pcap directly in your Android phone.


Shark app works with rooted devices, so if you want to install it, be sure that you have your device already rooted.

Good luck ;)
