Q:As of release 0.8.7 of Android Studio there's supposed to be a Bitmap viewer in the debugger. See the release notes here: http://tools.android.com/recent/androidstudio087released

I have 0.8.9 installed and I can't see this option. Has anyone been able to use this? Is there something I need to enable?

A:First run your program in debug mode by using Shift+F9 and set a breakpoint right after the bitmap object you want to investigate is created. Once the debugger pauses at the breakpoint hover over the bitmap variable and right click and select View Bitmap and that's all you need to view it.
