Q:I just updated ADT, than the SDK and now I have in only one project the issue, that my aapt isn't found

Error executing aapt. Please check aapt is present at /opt/android/platform-tools/aapt


The path is correct, I checked twice and more times.

-rwxrwxrwx 1 martin martin 3,5M 2010-12-08 10:41 /opt/android/platform-tools/aapt


I can start aapt via console, the permissions are 777, I restarted eclipse, closed/reopened the project, restarted adb and finally my Ubuntu.

Some ideas why this might happen only at one project?

A:It seems that cleaning this specific project doesn't work but cleaning all open project does the trick.

I leave this question if someone else get this issue.
