Q:Android includes

config_longAnimTime
config_mediumAnimTime
config_shortAnimTime


but the actual values identified by these constants don't make sense as milliseconds.  I'm sure they get compiled into useful values, and I can determine them with code, but I'm sure someone else knows the answer - and, more to the point, I'm sure other people will be looking for them.  So please post the actual values as an answer and save everyone a little bit of time.

A:Current values (since 3.x):


config_shortAnimTime=200 
config_mediumAnimTime=400
config_longAnimTime=500


And the duration of the activity open/close and fragment open/close animations:


config_activityShortDur=150
config_activityDefaultDur=220
