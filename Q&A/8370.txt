Q:I am just curious to know, whether there are possibilities to import more than one project at the same time into Eclipse. Because whenever I create my new workspace I had to import the needed projects from my old workspace to my newly created workspace. 

So it would be nice to know, if there are options to import multiple projects at the same time?

Thanks.

A:If all of your old projects exist in a single directory or in a single parent directory, you can do File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into workspace.  Choose a root directory that is a parent all of the projects you want to import.  You will then be able to import all of the projects at once.
