Q:I'm trying to use Jake Wharton's ViewPagerIndicator library, but I'm unable to get it working with my Gradle project in Android Studio. 

I add it as a dependency like so: 

    dependencies {
       // ... other ommitted
       compile 'com.viewpagerindicator:library:2.4.1'
       compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:19.0.1'
       compile 'com.nineoldandroids:library:2.4.0'
       // ...
    }


but the project doesn't seem to recognize any components in the library. I'm wondering if there's a dependency issue with different support-v4 versions or something in nineoldandroids...?

A:I just pushed a version inside maven central so you only need to add that dependency :

compile 'fr.avianey.com.viewpagerindicator:library:2.4.1.1@aar'


And declare maven central like this :

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}


Hope it helps...
