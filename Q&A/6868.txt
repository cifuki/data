Q:I was wondering if it's possible to somehow tap outside a popup dialog (or an Activity with a dialog theme), and dismiss it by just tapping outside of it?

I made a quick picture to illustrate it:



Normally, you have to press the back key to dismiss the dialogs, but on Honeycomb it could be great to have the option of just tapping outside the dialog, due to all the screen estate.

A:My app is a single activity with Theme.Holo.Dialog. In my case the other answer did not work. It only made the other background apps or the launch screen to receive touch events.

I found that using dispatchTouchEvent works in my case. I think it is also a simpler solution. Here's some sample code on how to use it to detect taps outside the activity with a Dialog theme:

@Override
public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
    Rect dialogBounds = new Rect();
    getWindow().getDecorView().getHitRect(dialogBounds);

    if (!dialogBounds.contains((int) ev.getX(), (int) ev.getY())) {
        // Tapped outside so we finish the activity
        this.finish();
    }
    return super.dispatchTouchEvent(ev);
}
