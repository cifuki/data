Q:I want to grep the adb logcat & write the output to a text file.
If I just do 

./adb logcat > std.txt


it writes the entire log to the text file & If I do 

./adb logcat | grep ABC


it prints all lines containing ABC to my terminal. But now I wish to search for ABC & write only these lines to a text file.

./adb logcat | grep ABC > std.txt


doesn't work. Plz help.

A:I think there is a problem with grep buffering. You can try something like this:

./adb logcat | grep --line-buffered ABC > std.txt


It should be the same problem for chained grep.

EDIT: A similar question can be found here: Why no output is shown when using grep twice?.
