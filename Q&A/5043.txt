Q:I would like to switch to certain views in a ViewFlipper. Currently, I have 6 children inside the ViewFlipper. And I am having some buttons for navigation. It is very much similar to "News and weather" application.

A:Call setDisplayedChild(), passing the 0-based index of the child View you want to display.
