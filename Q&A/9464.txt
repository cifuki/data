Q:I am using Android DownloadManger System Service for downloading some files in following way 

dwnId = mgr.enqueue(new DownloadManager.Request(serveruri)
        .setAllowedNetworkTypes(DownloadManager.Request.NETWORK_WIFI |
                DownloadManager.Request.NETWORK_MOBILE)
                .setAllowedOverRoaming(false)
                .setTitle(getAlbumName())
                .setDescription(getTrackName())
                .setDestinationUri(deviceUri)
                .setShowRunningNotification(true));


where mgr is Download Manager instance, dwnId is unique ID returned. I am also registering for ACTION_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE

registerReceiver(onDownloadComplete, new IntentFilter(DownloadManager.ACTION_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE));


and in the onDownloadComplete BroadcastReceiver's onReceive() method I am getting download Id like

Long dwnId = intent.getLongExtra(DownloadManager.EXTRA_DOWNLOAD_ID, 0);


After that I am querying Download Manager for Download status

Cursor c = downloadManager.query(new DownloadManager.Query().setFilterById(dwnId)); c.getInt(c.getColumnIndex(DownloadManager.COLUMN_STATUS));


for DownloadManager.STATUS_* constants. 

The problem is I am receiving the same downId twice (means onReceive method is called twice), once with DownloadManager.STATUS_SUCCESSFUL status and once with DownloadManager.STATUS_FAILED status for same dwnId. I am issuing request to download some 10 files at a time and but on device download manager it is showing the download count as some 12 or 13 in the notification bar top left means. I think that Download manager has some problem in downloading files and resumed or automatically restarted to download the same file again. Thats why there is a difference between the files count I requested to download and actual number in download queue. Because of this only I am getting same DownloadId complete action twice. If this is true, how to restrict it. Am I wrong what might be the reason for count difference between what I requested to actual download? Why is the broadcast receiver receiving the same download Id twice. Can anybody please let me know?

Thanks In Advance...

A:This is a reported bug see: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18462

The way around I found is to verify if the download was a success, if not ditch the intent or re-queue the file if it was never downloaded...

Lost a couple of hours figuring that one :(

** Edit: adding code example **

/**
 * Check if download was valid, see issue
 * http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18462
 * @param long1
 * @return
 */
private boolean validDownload(long downloadId) {

    Log.d(TAG,"Checking download status for id: " + downloadId);

    //Verify if download is a success
    Cursor c= dMgr.query(new DownloadManager.Query().setFilterById(downloadId));

    if(c.moveToFirst()){            
        int status = c.getInt(c.getColumnIndex(DownloadManager.COLUMN_STATUS));

        if(status == DownloadManager.STATUS_SUCCESSFUL){
            return true; //Download is valid, celebrate
        }else{
            int reason = c.getInt(c.getColumnIndex(DownloadManager.COLUMN_REASON));
            Log.d(TAG, "Download not correct, status [" + status + "] reason [" + reason + "]");            
            return false;
        }   
    }               
    return false;                                   
}
