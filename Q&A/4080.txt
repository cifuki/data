Q:I have a query that selects rows in a ListView without having a limit. But now that I have implemented a SharedPreferences that the user can select how much rows will be displayed in the ListView, my SQLite query doesn't work. I'm passing the argument this way:

return wDb.query(TABELANOME, new String[] {IDTIT, TAREFATIT, SUMARIOTIT}, CONCLUIDOTIT + "=1", null, null, null, null, "LIMIT='" + limite + "'");

110
A:The equals (=) operator is not used with the LIMIT clause. Remove it.

Here's an example LIMIT query:

SELECT column FROM table ORDER BY somethingelse LIMIT 5, 10


Or:

SELECT column FROM table ORDER BY somethingelse LIMIT 10


In your case, the correct statement would be:

return wDb.query(TABELANOME, new String[] {IDTIT, TAREFATIT, SUMARIOTIT}, CONCLUIDOTIT + "=1", null, null, null, null, String.valueOf(limite));


Take a look here at the SQLite select syntax: http://www.sqlite.org/syntaxdiagrams.html#select-stmt
