Q:Android emulator is so slow that it is not possible to test run applications. Is there anyway to debug/run applications on real phone with IDE instead of emulator?

A:You can generally switch on USB debugging on your handset and connect it up to your PC over USB. The handset will then appear to adb in the same way as an emulator. You might need to download drivers from your handset manufacturer for your phone.

On my HTC desire the setting is under:


  Settings -> Applications -> Development -> USB Debugging
