A:If you are working with xmls you can add it as Praveen Chandrasekaran said doing:

android:background="@drawable/myResouce"


Before that you have to put your image file inside the res/drawable folder.

You can also change it from the code doing:

  mTextView.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.myResouce);
