Q:Just installed the android sdk on my macbook pro. I created a virtual device, allotted 50mb worth of memory in android 3.0. I ran the emulator, and Android_ displays on the left, but the keyboard interface does not display on the right. I have hw.keyboard.lid enabled. Not sure if that has anything to do with it.

A:Press CTRL+F11 or num pad 7 to enable an onscreen keyboard within the OS.  I don't think the 3.0 emulator has an equivalent keyboard interface the way the others do.
