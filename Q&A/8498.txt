Q:I was trying to get Android Studio to use Java 1.7 on Mac OS X (Mountain Lion)

I went to File > Project Structure... and then tried to add a JDK with the + button and then selecting JDK.

I navigated to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home and selected that, but nothing happens. (this is where Oracle's Java updater installed Java 7 automatically)

How do I use Java 1.7 with Android Studio?

A:For those wonder how you start the actual program Android Studio with Java 7: edit the plist located in   /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/Info.plist

Change the xml key JVMVersion which is 1.6* to 1.7* (Java 7) or 1.6+ (latest version)

I don't know if there are any problems by doing this so take it easy.
