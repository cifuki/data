I created the 3 layouts HDPI and MDPI and LDPI and I edit the any one of xml file, in console, they show the error:


  warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class that doesn't come with an associated EnclosingMethod attribute. (This class was probably produced by a broken compiler.)

A:It is a common warning  when including jar files.

Use below line in proguard to avoid warning 

-keepattributes EnclosingMethod
