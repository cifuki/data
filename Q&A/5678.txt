Q:I have considerable experience in making Android applications. For my new project, we have decided to do Test Driven Development (TDD). I have been getting my hands wet on Robotium for User Scenario Testing, and it works fine and looks easy too. 

For unit testing, I tried to mock Context using (MockContext Android Class) but I am unable to do so. I went through this blog http://sites.google.com/site/androiddevtesting/ and through this http://sdudzin.blogspot.com/2011/01/easy-unit-testing-for-android.html , which suggests that mocking in Android apps is still very limited and hard, and have suggested to use PowerMock, jMockit, JeasyTest, or Roboelectric (in combination with Mockito and Maven) and even RoboGuice. 

I would like to get any suggestions from you guys on which unit testing framework in your opinion is the best for testing Android applications. (particularly testing Android classes, possibly giving mock Contexts and other mocking features so that I can make my test cases as independent as possible). Any suggestions or pointers would be helpful . Thanks

A:For off-device testing, look at Robolectric

For on-device testing, look at Borachio

Bottom line: it's still very, very difficult to do well. Things are improving (the situation is dramatically better today than it was 6 months ago) but Android is comfortably the most test-hostile environment I've ever written programs for.
