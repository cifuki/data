I set up a max length of text in an EditText field.

<EditText
            android:id="@+id/courseDescriptionField"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:inputType="textMultiLine"
            android:lines="5"
            android:maxLength="@integer/max_course_description_limit"
            android:gravity="left|top" >
        </EditText>


The problem for me however is, that, text STOPS appearing after 140 characters, but it still continues to type, except that text just doesn't appear, but however, it does appear in the "buffer" (meaning the suggestion thing) if that's what you would call it.

As a side note, I am using a TextWatcher to keep track of the limit. Is there any way to completely limit the amount of text, so that when there are 140 characters, nothing happens when something other than backspace/delete is pressed?

Use android:maxLength="140"

That should work. :)

Hope that helps
