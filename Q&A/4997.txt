Q:I am currently showing softkeyboard using the following code

InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.toggleSoftInput (InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, InputMethodManager.RESULT_HIDDEN);


And Here I d'not bind the softkeyboard with Edittext because of that I had used the above code.

Now I want to close the SoftKeyboard so i am currently using the below code but it is not working.

imm.toggleSoftInput (InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, InputMethodManager.RESULT_HIDDEN);


Can Anyone suggest me what to use for closing the softKeyboard ?



Based on Below Answer I want to let you clear that I am not using EditText, I use Layout on which I want to show Keyboard and Hide keyboard. I want to send keyboard key event to remote area bcoz of that I didnot used editText.

A:I have tested and this is working:

...
//to show soft keyboard
imm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, 0);

//to hide it, call the method again
imm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, 0);


By the way, the second parameter of your code is not right, please have a look at here.
