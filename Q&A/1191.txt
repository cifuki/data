Q:I am programatically adding custom views to a vertical LinearLayout, and I would like there to be some space between the views.  I have tried adding: setPadding(0, 1, 0, 1) to my CustomView constructor, but this doesn't seem to have any effect.  Any advice?

*It was pointed out that I should use margins.  Since I am dynamically adding views, I need to set the margins from code (not in xml).  I believe the way to do this is below, but it isn't working.

public class MyView extends View
{
    public MyView (Context context)
    {
        super(context);

        MarginLayoutParams params = new MarginLayoutParams(LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,  LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
        params.setMargins(0, 10, 0, 10);
        setLayoutParams(params);


*Edit.  I also tried using MarginLayoutParams as a parameter while adding the views to the Linear layout (as below).  This also did not work:

MarginLayoutParams params = new MarginLayoutParams(linearLayout.getLayoutParams());
linearLayout.setMargins(0, 10, 0, 10);
linearLayout.addView(view, params);


Thank you.

A:You should android:layout_margin<Side> on the children. Padding is internal.
