Q:After a recent update to Android Studio, we're having problems getting a project to compile that previously worked. At first we were getting the following error:

/Users/james/Development/AndroidProjects/myapp/app/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/com.android.support/appcompat-v7/23.0.0/res/values-v23/values-v23.xml
Error:(2) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Inverse'.
Error:(2) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:Widget.Material.Button.Colored'.


I updated the sdk build target in our gradle file to 23, which made this specific issue go away, but it left us with a ton of apache.http package errors (specifically, a ton of apache packages we use for http stuff are now gone in sdk 23).

What I want to do is solve the strange resource error, but without updating to sdk 23. I don't have the time to re-write our tools library right now to use whatever new implementation of apache http components has been issued. Does anyone have any ideas?

A:Change the appcompat version in your build.gradle file back to 22.2.1 (or whatever you were using before).
