Q:I\xc2\xb4m running a linux android sdk installation and my new project needs Build tools 21.1.1

Somehow, this build tools do not exist, eventhough my sdk is up to date, but in the build-tools folder there is now android-4.4W folder

android update sdk --no-ui



My sdk/build-tools folder



I\xc2\xb4ve moved the content testwise to a 21.1.1 folder, but this isn\xc2\xb4t recognized either.

Is this a bug?How to I get the right build tools?

A:What worked for me was:

android list sdk -a


Which showed me the following list:

1- Android SDK Tools, revision 24.0.2
2- Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 21
3- Android SDK Build-tools, revision 21.1.2
4- Android SDK Build-tools, revision 21.1.1
5- Android SDK Build-tools, revision 21.1
6- Android SDK Build-tools, revision 21.0.2
7- Android SDK Build-tools, revision 21.0.1
... and a great many more


Followed by the command:

android update sdk -a -u -t 3


The "3" in the command refers the the index listed in the output of the first command.
