Q:What is different between getContext() and getActivity() from Fragment in support library?

Do they always return the same object? (activity associated with current fragment)

A:In most cases there is no difference but ...

So originally Fragments were hosted in FragmentsActivity and back then to get Context one called getActivity().

Just checked the sources and Fragments now can be hosted by anyone implementing FragmentHostCallback interface.  And this changed in Support Library version 23, I think.

When using newer version of Support Library, when Fragment is not hosted by an Activity you can get different objects when calling getActivity() and getContext().

When you call getActivity() you get an Activity which is a Context as well.
But when you call getContext you will get a Context which might not be an Activity.
