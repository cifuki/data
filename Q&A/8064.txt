A:Chris Banes (the same guy that implemented the best pull to refresh component for android) also implemented the GMail like Pull To Refresh. 

You can find it here: https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh

Note that this project is still under development so the current API may change.

Update:

Both ActionBar-PullToRefresh and Android-PullToRefresh are deprecated. Standart way to implement a pull to refresh is using SwipeRefreshLayout of v4 support library.

Here is the required steps:


Create a root or sub layout with SwipeRefreshLayout and put a scrollable item in it.

<android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout
    ...>

<ListView
    .... />

</android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout>

Add a refresh listener

SwipeRefreshLayout srl = ...;
srl.setOnRefreshListener(
    new SwipeRefreshLayout.OnRefreshListener() {
        @Override
        public void onRefresh() {
            ...
        }
    });
