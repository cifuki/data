Q:I would like to be able to run the lint task when I'm building projects with android studio to ensure the lint rules are being followed.

I have tried using task dependencies but with no luck.  My teamcity build server uses the build task which runs the lint task, so that works great.  However, android studio appears to use generateDebugSources and compileDebugJava tasks interchangeably when I have selected the debug build variant.

Here is what I have tried in my build.gradle:

assemble.dependsOn lint

A:If you just want to configure your Android Studio project to run the lint check before the default run configuration without affecting how your gradle tasks are configured, you can follow these steps.


Open the run configurations drop down and choose edit


 


Select your app run configuration





Press the '+' to add a new step





Choose "Gradle-aware Make"





Type 'check' and choose the option with your app module name and check.  (Mine is :app:check)





Press the up arrow to move the new check step before the existing Gradle-aware make step




Now, Android Studio will run the lint check and fail the build if any lint errors occur.
