Q:I want my application to recognize barcodes taken by camera. Is it possible using Android SDK?

Something like this:
Barcode Scanner

A:It's not built into the SDK, but you can use the Zxing library. It's free, open source, and Apache-licensed.

The 2016 recommendation is to use the Barcode API, which also works offline.
