  Slow Android emulator  




Is there any fast and more efficient android emulator is available? I'm sick of android default emulator. Thanks

UPDATE 2:
Genymotionis great too, since BlueStack App Player now forces you to install some apps to continue using free version. I tried Genymotion and quite happy with speed for App development, haven't tried gaming yet. Happy coding :)

UPDATE:
BlueStack App Player is the best and your world will be much easier. I recommend every one to download and test it now. You will thank me later :). To use it with eclipse just use this command in command prompt.

adb connect 127.0.0.1


and after that you can launch apk on your faster and awesome emulator directly from your eclipse.
Works on Windows and MAC.
