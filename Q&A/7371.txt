Q:I have a TextView with android:autoLink="email".

If I put my email address in there then a link appears that I can click.

How do I have different text appear (for example 'Send Feedback') instead of the email address but still behave the same when clicked?

Thanks

A:To achieve what I wanted required a different approach:

TextView feedback = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.TextViewSendFeedback);
feedback.setText(Html.fromHtml("<a href=\\"mailto:ask@me.it\\">Send Feedback</a>"));
feedback.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance());


This basically places HTML in the TextView so I get a link saying 'Send Feedback' but clicking it opens the default email application.

Word of warning: Trying this in the emulator didn't initially work for me, saying it was unsupported. This was just because I didn't have an email account setup. Setting one up in the emulator made the link work as I wanted.
