Q:When I am trying to run an android application which uses Google API I get the following error


  [2009-07-11 11:46:43 - FirstMapView] Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY
  [2009-07-11 11:46:43 - FirstMapView] Please check logcat output for more details.

A:To get past INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY error with Google Maps for Android:


Install Google map APIs.  This can be done in Eclipse Windows/Android SDK and AVD Manager -> Available Packages -> Third Party Add-ons -> Google Inc. -> Google APIs by Google Inc., Android API X
From command line create new AVD.  This can be done by listing
targets (android list targets), then android create  avd -n
new_avd_api_233 -t "Google Inc.:Google APIs:X"
Then create AVD (Android Virtual Device) in Eclipse Windows/Android
SDK and AVD Manager -> New... -> (Name: new_avd_X, Target: Google
APIs (Google Inc.) - API Level X)

IMPORTANT : You must create your AVD with Target as Google APIs (Google Inc.) otherwise it will again failed. 
Create Android Project in Eclipse File/New/Android Project and
select Google APIs Build Target.
add <uses-library android:name="com.google.android.maps" />
between <application> </application> tags.
Run Project as Android Application.


If error persists, then you still have problems, if it works, then this error is forever behind you.
