Q:I have a foreground service setup in Android.  I would like to update the notification text.  I am creating the service as shown below.

How can I update the notification text that is setup within this foreground service?  What is the best practise for updating the notification?  Any sample code would be appreciated.

public class NotificationService extends Service {

    private static final int ONGOING_NOTIFICATION = 1;

    private Notification notification;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        this.notification = new Notification(R.drawable.statusbar, getText(R.string.app_name), System.currentTimeMillis());
        Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(this, AbList.class);
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, notificationIntent, 0);
        this.notification.setLatestEventInfo(this, getText(R.string.app_name), "Update This Text", pendingIntent);

        startForeground(ONGOING_NOTIFICATION, this.notification);

    }


I am creating the service in my main activity as shown below:

    // Start Notification Service
    Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(this, NotificationService.class);
    startService(serviceIntent);

A:I would think that calling startForeground() again with the same unique ID and a Notification with the new information would work, though I have not tried this scenario.

Update: Based on the comments, you should use NotifcationManager to update the notification and your service continues to stay in the foreground mode. Take a look at the answer below.
