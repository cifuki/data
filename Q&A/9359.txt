Q:So I've made a wearable application where I can control a robot-car with the buttons on screen with the MessageListenerService. After trying to build the project, I had some problems where it asked me to install "Android Support Repository" from the SDK, which I already had. I found another similar problem on SO (link)  which had a sort-of solution, but now it says 


  "Error: The java Plugin has been applied, but it is not compatible with the Android Plugins"


This is my build.gradle in my wearable module

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'java'


sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6   //these two lines
targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6   //are the only ones that matter

android {
    compileSdkVersion 20
    buildToolsVersion "20.0.0"
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6
    }
signingConfigs {
    release {
        keyAlias 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Riekelt\\\\coolie.jks'
        keyPassword 'cut-out'
        storeFile file('path/to/release.keystore')
        storePassword 'cut-out'
    }
}

defaultConfig {
    applicationId "robowheel.robond"
    minSdkVersion 20
    targetSdkVersion 20
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
}
buildTypes {
    release {
        runProguard false
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release

    }
}
}

dependencies {
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
compile 'com.google.android.support:wearable:+'
compile "com.android.support:support-v4:20.0.+"
compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:+'
 //   compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:6.1.11'

}


Anyone know what is the matter? Thanks in advancoi

A:The problem is that you cannot apply both the com.android.application and the java plugin in the same module. Why are you doing that? There's nothing in the question you reference that tell you to apply the java plugin.

Remove the line with apply plugin: 'java', and you're good to go
