Q:In my application there is a ListFragment where each item from the list contains a checkbox. Whenever the user clicks on one of those checkboxes the app starts an ActionMode context menu.
But I want the application to close the ActionMode menu when clicking on another component.
I tried Fragment#closeContextMenu() without success.

Any ideas how can I accomplish that?

A:Whenever you are creating/starting ActionMode Create by

mMode = startActionMode(....);


To Dismiss it use following Syntax

if (mMode != null) 
 {
     mMode.finish();
 }
