Q:My app depends on a library project. This library project depends on the Android Compatibility Package V4. I have NOT exported the library project's dependency. In my own project, I've added ACL V13 as a dependency, but when compiling I get the error that essentially there's a duplicate dependency. I thought not exporting the library project's dependency would resolve this issue, but it's not.

How can I resolve this?

EDIT

Also, according to Android tools docs: 


  Special case for android-support-v4.jar and android-support-v13.jar.
  
  We make a special case for these two libraries because -v13 contains a
  full version of -v4 inside. If both are found, then only -v13 will be
  used.


So it should just work...

A:If you use exactly the same lib jar in different projects (libs project or standard projects), the apk tools get rid automatically of the duplicate ones.

The problem starts when you have two libs with the same name but not at the same revision.

The android-support-v4.jar and android-support-v13.jar files can be from different revision since there always have the same name in different  support package release (http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html#Notes)

I would check that you use exactly the same revision of the support libs in your main project and in your lib project.

To make sure, copy the two support libraries jars (located in the android-sdk folder) to your projects libs folder.

{android-sdk}/extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar
AND
{android-sdk}/extras/android/support/v13/android-support-v13.jar


It should get rid of the problem.
