Q:If I'm having a problem with Android Studio, and want to see if it exists in a previous version, where do I go to find the older (obsolete) version of Android Studio?  There's no link to previous versions on the download page, only other download options, does not give older versions.

A:A good way to try something in another version of Android Studio is to make a second installation. 

You can download previous versions through a third-party site from the following links (thanks Nikhil):


For Windows
For Mac


Unfortunately, I couldn't find archives for linux.

The official archive download site is here, but most if not all of the older version links are dead.

You may also want to download the IDE only and set it up to point to your existing SDK.  To do this, in your new installation of Android Studio, go to 

Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager 

and under 

Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Android SDK, 

enter the android SDK location path of the other install.



Note on downloads:

If you know the version you want, a link like http://tools.android.com/download/studio/builds/2-1-3 will get you to a download page for 2.1.3 via the tools.android.com site, if you prefer.

EDIT :

Above site doesn't have older versions after V2.3. You can now download previous version from the following link :

Windows & Mac
