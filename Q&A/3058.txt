Q:I have been doing debugging on Android using my Nexus 4, however I recently encountered this error here. After doing some research on this error, it seems to be an issue with the app not being deleted properly. The app I am debugging runs fine on my other Android devices as well as the emulators, this error is only occuring on my Nexus 4. I plugged my device into computer, and have tried deleting the data/data folders but I am still getting the same issue. I also checked settings-apps to check it was definitely uninstalled. 

Does anyone have any idea how to resolve this issue? According to some users, I need root access to properly delete data/data, is this true? Or is there another way around this?

A:Sometimes you have to also uninstall the data folders. For me, I had a package in userspace of com.kikin.cts, and also a folder directory in /data/data/com.kikin.cts. Kept getting INSTALL_FAILED_UID_CHANGED, but after removing the data folder, the error went away.
