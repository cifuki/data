A:apply plugin: 'android' specifies that It's an Android project but it does not specify Its an Application or Library project. To make life easier you can tell gradle the type of project and indicate which plugin should be used. I recommend to use apply plugin: 'com.android.application if project is an app and apply plugin: 'com.android.library' if project is a lib. It helps gradle to compile project efficiently.
