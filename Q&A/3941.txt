Q:I would like to get the context of application which has reference/hosted my library at run-time inside one class of my library project. Is it possible? If yes, how?

Thanks

Update
I don't want my user to pass context in parameter to my library project because it is possible that my library project will be called through JNI and I have no idea how I can get context in JNI and pass it to Java layer.

Yes.


  If yes, how?


Pass it in as a parameter.

Then figure out "how [you] can get context in JNI and pass it to Java layer". I would imagine that you would pass it like any other object. As @Blundell noted, you do not really have any other option.
