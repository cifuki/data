Q:I understand that Android's developer site provides information on this topic. I have already read the following three pages:


Supporting Multiple Screens
Screen Sizes and Densites
Icon Design Guidelines


They do not give the information/statistics that I am looking for. Judging from the second link, the two most important screen categories to support are normal-hdpi and normal-mdpi.

The problem is that simply knowing that these two categories are the most popular is of no help to me. The website gives me a range of screen sizes and densities that go into these categories, but the ranges are quite large.

I want to know what the most popular phones are in these two categories. More specifically, I am looking for the most popular resolutions in these two categories.

A:You can see the resolutions for those categories in the Table 2, in this section: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#testing
