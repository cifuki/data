Q:I found the following function in package android.app.ActivityManager.

public static boolean isUserAMonkey ()


The reference describes:


  public static boolean isUserAMonkey ()   Since: API Level 8
  
  Returns "true" if the user interface is currently being messed with by a monkey.


I was shocked by this strange function. And have a few questions.


What does this (user interface is currently being messed with by a
monkey) mean?
What is the practical use of this function?
Why do they use isUserAMonkey for the function name?

A:This method is for checking whether the current user is a test user by some automatic testing, called 'monkey' by Android devs.
