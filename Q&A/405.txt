Q:I'm trying to force the "portrait" mode for my application because my application is absolutely not designed for the "landscape" mode.

After reading some forums, I added these lines in my manifest file:

<application 
  android:debuggable="true"
  android:icon="@drawable/icon" 
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:screenOrientation="portrait">


But it doesn't work on my device (HTC Desire). It switches from "portrait" lo "landscape", ignoring the lines from the manifest file.

After more forums reading, I tried to add this in my manifest file:

<application 
  android:debuggable="true"
  android:icon="@drawable/icon" 
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:configChanges="orientation"       
  android:screenOrientation="portrait">


and this function in my activity class:

public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig)
{
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);
    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
}


But again, no luck.

A:Don't apply the orientation to the application element, instead you should apply the attribute to the activity element, and you must also set configChanges as noted below.

Example:

<activity
   android:screenOrientation="portrait"
   android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden">
</activity>


This is applied in the manifest file AndroidManifest.xml.
