Q:I've been working with Android Studio (my current version 1.5) for 2 years. Everything was OK, but when I downloaded Canary (2.1 p5), everything went wrong. Every time I want to create a new project or open a project or sync or import a new lib or dependency, gradle is taking too long to build â€” nearly 20 min.

I did not do anything, I just downloaded the Canary version and ran it.

Symptoms :


It happened when I connected to Internet
The first delay is on Gradle: Resolve dependencies ':app:_debugCompile'
...
After 25 min building almost done


Note:
When I disconnect my Internet, gradle will finish as fast as possible



I tried to fix this by these ways:


I changed the gradle to offline work (it worked but I don't want this way, because I want to import libs or dependencies)
I've created a new file (file name is gradle.properties) in C:\\Users\\username\\.gradle then wrote these lines into it

org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.daemon=true

I removed that version then installed my old version which worked OK but the problem was still there :( 
Disable / Enable firewall
Disable / Enable AntiVirus (Nod32)
Reinstall Windows OS (8.1)
I've downloaded all versions (1.0.0, ..., 1.5.1, 2.0.0, 2.1)
I've used a proxy

A:The problem is solved !

After 2 days searching , I got the solution , so I would like to share with all people who may have the same problem. The problem is gradlecan not connect to center repository in some country. When you create a new project or import , your center repository is jcenter() by default and whenever you want to build or sync or add new external dependency, gradle is going to connect to https://bintray.com/ but it can not and the building process is going to wait till connect to jcenter(), so this process might take long time ( +30 min ) , even you can not add new dependency .

Solution :


Make sure you have latest stable version ( current 2.0.0 )
Make sure your gradle version is 2.0.0 in build.gradle (classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0')
Final step and most important one is change your jcenter() to mavenCentral()


So you can easily add new dependency and sync project under 3sec !

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
