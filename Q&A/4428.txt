Q:I was wondering if there was a way to display all text in a toast to be centered. For instance, I have a toast that has 2 lines of text in it. For purely aesthetic reasons, I would like the text to center-aligned instead of left-aligned. I've looked through the documentation and can't find anything about it. Is there a simple way to do this that I have missed?

Thanks
Chris

A:Use the Toast's setView(view) function to supply a View with Gravity.CENTER.
