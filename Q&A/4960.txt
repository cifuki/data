A:Start by reading the documentation. Also, copying from Application Fundamentals:


  Broadcast receivers
  
  A broadcast receiver is a component that responds to system-wide
  broadcast announcements. Many
  broadcasts originate from the
  system\xe2\x80\x94for example, a broadcast
  announcing that the screen has turned
  off, the battery is low, or a picture
  was captured. Applications can also
  initiate broadcasts\xe2\x80\x94for example, to
  let other applications know that some
  data has been downloaded to the device
  and is available for them to use.
  Although broadcast receivers don't
  display a user interface, they may
  create a status bar notification to
  alert the user when a broadcast event
  occurs. More commonly, though, a
  broadcast receiver is just a "gateway"
  to other components and is intended to
  do a very minimal amount of work. For
  instance, it might initiate a service
  to perform some work based on the
  event.
  
  A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of
  BroadcastReceiver and each broadcast
  is delivered as an Intent object. For
  more information, see the
  BroadcastReceiver class.


Finally, read in Common Tasks how you can utilize BroadcastReceivers to listen for messages and set alarms.
