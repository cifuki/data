Q:I have some clickable views and I want to set the default available background that is present on list click (in ICS is a blue color). I have tried putting as background this:

android:background="@android:drawable/list_selector_background"


but it is not the default blue I have by default (the one I used is orange). What is the drawable used by default on android as click selector?

Thanks

A:It's list_selector_holo_dark or the equivalent holo light version; and these are the defaults in Honeycomb and above. list_selector_background is the non-holo version, used in Gingerbread and below.

EDIT: I believe (but can't confirm) that the platform agnostic selector is ?android:attr/listSelector
