Q:What I wanted to achieve is this: Right after the activity starts, I want that no RadioButton is selected/checked. 

My problem is this: When the activity starts, the first RadioButton is always selected/checked.

I tried radioButton1.setChecked(false) right after initialization of the radiobutton(inside onCreate), but when the activity starts, I can't manually check/select the first radiobutton. Till I select the 2nd or 3rd radio button, I can now select/check the first radio button.

radioGroup.clearCheck();
