Q:Just noticed that android:password has been deprecated, and we should be using android:inputType. Was experimenting with it by setting in my xml 

android:inputType="textPassword" 


Indeed it behaves like 

android:password="true" 


for EditText, but it seems that if I use android:inputType, android:hint will not work. The EditText will be blank. There is no such issues when using android:password with android:hint. Am I missing something here about android:inputType?

A:Hint is displayed correctly with 

android:inputType="textPassword"


and

android:gravity="center"


if you set also 

android:ellipsize="start"
