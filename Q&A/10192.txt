Q:I'm completely new to Kotlin. I want to do a login validation using POST method and to get some information using GET method. I've URL, server Username and Password already of my previous project. I didn't find any proper example project which uses this thing. Anyone please suggest me any working example where I can use GET and POST method in HTTP request

A:For Android, Volley is a good place to get started. For all platforms, you might also want to check out ktor client.

However, you can use standard libraries you would use in Java. For example, with HttpURLConnection you can do:

fun sendGet() {
    val url = URL("http://www.google.com/")

    with(url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection) {
        requestMethod = "GET"  // optional default is GET

        println("\
Sent 'GET' request to URL : $url; Response Code : $responseCode")

        inputStream.bufferedReader().use {
            it.lines().forEach { line ->
                println(line)
            }
        }
    }
}


Or simpler: 

URL("https://google.com").readText()
