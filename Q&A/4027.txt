Q:I'm doing some Android development, and i much prefer Visual Studio, but I'll have to use Eclipse for this.

Has anyone made a tool that switches Eclipse to look and behave more like visual studio? I mainly can't stand its clippyesqe suggestions on how I should program (Yes, I know I have not yet used that private field! Thanks Eclipse!), or its incredibly lousy intellisense.

For example, in eclipse, if I don't type this first, its intellisense won't realize I want to look for locally scoped members. Also, the TAB to complete VS convention is drilled into my head, and Eclipse is ENTER to complete, I could switch everything by hand but that would take hours, and I was hoping someone had some sort of theme or something that has already done it.

A:There are also other choices for Java IDEs.  You've obviously found Eclipse, but you also may want to check out IntelliJ and NetBeans.  IntelliJ is not free, but has a 30 day evaluation period and a Visual Studio key map :)

Shop around, find one that you like and start to use it heavily.  They are all very good IDEs, and I'm sure once you use one for a while you'll get comfortable with it.
