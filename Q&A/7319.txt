Q:I spent some hours trying to solve this:


  app:mergeDebugResources AAPT err(927129865): C:\\Users\\Will\\AndroidStudioProjects\\Splitter2\\app\\build\\intermediates\\exploded-aar\\com.android.support\\appcompat-v7\\22.0.0\\res\\drawable-hdpi-v4\\abc_spinner_mtrl_am_alpha.9.png:
  
  libpng warning: iCCP: Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been
  edited


My project is finally running but every time I make a clean built it shows this warning again.

I updated my buildToolsVersion to "22.0.1" and I am using tools.build:gradle "1.2.3". I'm still getting this error.

Everything started when I tried to use FancyButton.

Someone knows how to solve this problem?

A:It's just a warning, which libpng started issuing at version 1.6.0, so you can ignore it.

To get rid of the warning, you need to fix the PNG file that's named in the warning.  You can use any one of a number of PNG image editors (ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick, etc.) to remove the offending iCCP chunk.  Or you can downgrade your libpng to version 1.5.x.
