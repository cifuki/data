Q:I am beginner in Android programming.  My problem is, that I can not update ADT. The problem started, when after a long time I have updated in Android SDK Manager the Android SDK Tools. Then I was trying to import a project into the workspace. But I couldn't import that, because every time I clicked the Finish button, nothing happened. Then I closed Eclipse and opened it again, and showed me the following error:



I clicked on the Check for Updates, but it didn't find anything. On the Internet I have found an URL, so I clicked Help-->Install New Software...--> Add--> and pasted this URL. When I clicked Next, it showed me the list of items which I wanted to install and also an error:

Cannot complete the install because of a conflicting dependency.
 Software being installed: Tracer for OpenGL ES 23.0.0.1245622 (com.android.ide.eclipse.gldebugger.feature.feature.group 23.0.0.1245622)

Only one of the following can be installed at once:

I have also read somewhere, that I should try to replace the plugins folder with the updated plugins folder so I tried to rename "plugins" folder in the Eclipse folder to "pluginsx" and pasted the new one I have downloaded from the site. After this I couldn't open the Eclipse.

This site is also about the same problem as I have, and there is an answer which is accepted as the solution of the question. So I tried also to download, and copy those 3 things to folders which were mentioned in the comment below, but I have still the same problem, nothing changed. 

So now I don't have any idea, how to fix this problem. Can anyone help me, please?

Thanks in advance.

A:Help-->Install New Software-->What is already installed?

Then, Select "Android DDMS, Andoid Devlopment Tools,Android Hierarcy Viewer, Android native Development Tools, Android Traceview, Tracer for OpenGL ES" and click Uninstall.

After all this step, try Add link (https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/) and name is ADT Plugin. This link will get the latest ADT Plugin. In this way you reinstall the ADT.
