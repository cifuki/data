Q:Is there a way to get the launchable activity for a package from using adb?  For an unroot phone (i.e. without having the pull the apk from /data/app directory and inspect with appt).

I tried dumpsys, but it does not include information on default launchable activity.

Thanks

A:You don't need root to pull the apk files from /data/app. Sure, you might not have permissions to list the contents of that directory, but you can find the file locations of APKs with:

adb shell pm list packages -f


Then you can use adb pull:

adb pull <APK path from previous command>


and then aapt to get the information you want:

aapt dump badging <pulledfile.apk>
