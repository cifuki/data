Q:The abundance of HTML parsers to choose from (and stick with) is mind boggling:

http://java-source.net/open-source/html-parsers

How do I choose one that best suits the following requirements:


Mature (fewer bugs than the rest)
Live and breathing (i.e. being
maintained)
Fast and resource-efficient
(intended to run on Android)


Based on your experience, which HTML parser would you recommend (for meeting the above requirements) and why?

A:Well, I found the answer, which was given by @BalusC on a different thread:


If you just want to use a XML based
tool to traverse it: JTidy.
If you like to unit test the HTML:
HtmlUnit
If you like to extract specific data
from the HTML: Jsoup


Thank you @BalusC.
