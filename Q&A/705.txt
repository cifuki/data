Q:I have an activity that is using the Theme.Dialog style such that it is a floating window over another activity. However, when I click outside the dialog window (on the background activity), the dialog closes. How can I stop this behaviour?

A:This could help you. It is a way to handle the touch outside event:

How to cancel an Dialog themed like Activity when touched outside the window?

By catching the event and doing nothing, I think you can prevent the closing. But what is strange though, is that the default behavior of your activity dialog should be not to close itself when you touch outside.

(PS: the code uses WindowManager.LayoutParams)
