Q:I have a simple class written in Android Studio:

package com.mysite.myapp;

import org.apache.http.client.HttpClient;

public class Whatever {
    public void headBangingAgainstTheWallExample () {
        HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
    }
}


and from this I get the following compile time error:

Cannot resolve symbol HttpClient

Isn't HttpClient included in the Android Studio SDK? Even if it is not, I added it to my Gradle build like this:

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0'
    compile 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5'
}


With or without the last compile line, the error is the same. What am I missing?

A:HttpClient is not supported any more in sdk 23. You have to use URLConnection or downgrade to sdk 22 (compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.2.0')

If you need sdk 23, add this to your gradle:

android {
    useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'
}


You also may try to download and include HttpClient jar directly into your project or use OkHttp instead
