Q:I am little confused between the life cycle of two activities.

Suppose I have Activity A and Activity B.

B is called From A i.e A ---->  B.

Now currently B is on the screen and I pressed back button. Here I want know:- is there any memory still available for B(Active) or B's memory is flushed(Inactive).

A:Suppose there is an activity A, from which you launch activity B. If, while in activity B, you hit the back button, you are popping activity B off the stack and B will not be in the activity stack any longer.

Whenever you push an activity to the stack, onCreate is called, and if you press back button, onDestroy is called, which means that the activity is flushed away.
