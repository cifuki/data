Q:After updating the SDK, Eclipse shows this error:


  ADB server didn't ACK, failed to start daemon.


When I run an Android application, it gives me the following:


  Please ensure that adb is correctly located at 'D:\\android-sdk-windows\\platform-tools\\adb.exe' and can be executed.


How can I fix this problem?

A:Thanks, @jowett, I have solved my same problem, doing these steps

Step 1:
CTRL+Shift+Esc to open the task manager, which has adb.exe process and end (kill) that process

Step 2:
Now, close the eclipse, which is currently running on my computer.

Step 3:
Again, restart eclipse then solved that problem.



For those using OS X

killall adb


For those using Windows

adb kill-server


should do the trick.
