Q:I am new to Android development. By following this tutorial I got errors The import com.google.android.gms cannot be resolved when I wrote the code into the MainActivity.java:

import com.google.android.gms.maps.CameraUpdateFactory;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.BitmapDescriptorFactory;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.Marker;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.MarkerOptions;


By searching for various fixes I made sure to try these out:


I have downloaded Google API's for a particular API level through
Android SDK manager.
I checked off Google API as project build target.
I have added <uses-library android:name="com.google.android.maps" />
line into the AndroidManifest.xml as a child of <application> tag.
I cleaned the project by selecting Project->Clean... and built it
from scratch.
I included .jar file for maps by right-clicking on my project, went
to build path and added external archive locating it in my SDK: android-sdk-windows\\add-ons\\addon_google_apis_google_inc_8\\libs\\maps


Unfortunately, none of the above have helped.

That is irrelevant, as that is for Maps V1, and you are trying to use Maps V2.

This is doubly wrong.

First, never manually modify the build path in an Android project. If you are doing that, at best, you will crash at runtime, because the JAR you think you put in your project (via the manual build path change) is not in your APK. For an ordinary third-party JAR, put it in the libs/ directory of your project, which will add it to your build path automatically and add its contents to your APK file.

However, Maps V2 is not a JAR. It is an Android library project that contains a JAR. You need the whole library project.

You need to import the android-sdk-windows\\add-ons\\addon_google_apis_google_inc_8 project into Eclipse, then add it to your app as a reference to an Android library project.
