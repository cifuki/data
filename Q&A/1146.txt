Q:Recently i found that AndroidStudio reminds me to remove some class cast. I remember that in the old time, we have to cast the result of findViewById, but now it's not necessary. 

The result of findViewById is still View, so i want to know why we don't need to cast the class?

I can't find any documents mentioned that, can anyone find any document?

A:Starting with API 26, findViewById uses inference for its return type, so you no longer have to cast. 

Old definition: 

View findViewById(int id)


New definition:

<T extends View> T findViewById(int id)


So if your compileSdk is at least 26, it means that you can make use of this :)
