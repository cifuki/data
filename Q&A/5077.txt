Q:if you are a developer and have little clue about designs - Twitter Bootstrapt saves the day (at least for me).

Is there something similar for android (native, not web)? Because at least for me the default buttons, and black background looks truly ugly (same as plain browser buttons, which Twitter Bootstrap makes so nice looking)

http://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html gives some icons, and fonts, but maybe there is more ?
