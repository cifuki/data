Q:Can't seem to find any mention of support of Google Play services on Android 5.0 API 21 (Lollipop) in what seems like the canonical thread on the subject or google. Does anyone have any insight on this? 

I'm familiar with the practice of downloading the gapps package and installing, have it working on Kitkat and Jellybean just fine. Both of those install packages seem to hose the VM if I try them on 5.0

With the recent Genymotion upgrades I was hoping they'd be beefing up for compatibility, but I can't seem to find any hints.

A:You can download the Google Apps for Android 5.0 (Lollipop) from this URL https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=95784891001614559 as instructed here (Genymotion with Google Play Services).
I already have them working on the Genymotion "Lollipop Preview - Nexus 5" device.
