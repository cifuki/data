Q:I'm getting this error when uploading my Phonegap app to the Google Play Developer Console:


  Your APK's version code needs to be higher than 2.


How can I fix this?

A:If you're directly using Gradle, or indirectly through Android Studio:

I fixed it by editing the version number inside of the build.gradle file!  There is a small banner at the bottom of the android.manifest file that says "these changes are being overwritten by the build.gradle file."
