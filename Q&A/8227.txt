Q:It seems like every example I can find of switching between activities involves creating an Intent and passing in the context of a View via an OnClickListener associated with a button.

But what if you just decide you need to switch activities? In my case, a preference value is causing an Activity switch.

How do you create an Intent that can cause an Activity switch without an associated OnClickListener?

A:This should do it for you:

Intent myIntent = new Intent(this, MyActivityName.class);
startActivity(myIntent);


You can call that from anywhere in your current activity.
