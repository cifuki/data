Q:Are the users able to convert the apk file of my application back to the actual code?
If they do - is there any way to prevent this?

A:First, an apk file is just a modified jar file.  So the real question is can they decompile the dex files inside.  The answer is sort of.  There are already disassemblers, such as dedexer and smali.  You can expect these to only get better, and theoretically it should eventually be possible to decompile to actual Java source (at least sometimes).  See the previous question decompiling DEX into Java sourcecode. 

What you should remember is obfuscation never works.  Choose a good license and do your best to enforce it through the law.  Don't waste time with unreliable technical measures.
