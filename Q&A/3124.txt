Q:I'm working on building an Android app and I'm wondering what the best approach is to debugging like that of console.log in javascript

A:The Log class:


  API for sending log output.
  
  Generally, use the Log.v() Log.d() Log.i() Log.w() and Log.e()
  methods.
  
  The order in terms of verbosity, from least to most is ERROR, WARN,
  INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE. Verbose should never be compiled into an
  application except during development. Debug logs are compiled in but
  stripped at runtime. Error, warning and info logs are always kept.


Outside of Android, System.out.println(String msg) is used.
