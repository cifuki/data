Q:I have finally created a 'final' keystore for my app. As my app is using Google Maps, I take I have to update all Layouts to use the new API Key resulting from the app as well..

Now I'm fully aware of the requirement to export a signed APK for release, but what after that? My thoughts are that for further development and testing, it would be easiest if I could configure Eclipse to use my final keystore instead of the debug keystore \xe2\x80\xa6 but I found no way to do that? It only allows me to configure an 'alternative' debug key but I guess that's not the same.

Sorry if I am too confused if I have totally misunderstood something here.

A:I was able to to use my Google Play release keystore as my custom debug keystore to help with debugging in-app purchase functionality. The same could no doubt be applied to debugging Google Maps stuff as well.

As Devunwired mentioned, there are caveats. But my solution was this:


Copy your release key somewhere.
Change the keystore password/key password and key alias following the instructions here (also, following Devunwired's recommendations to make it look like a debug keystore).
Change Eclipse's  Preferences > Android > Build > Custom keystore setting to the path of the copy made in step 1.
Done!
