Q:I got problem when i want to add an android platform to my phoneGap application.
I got this message in my CLI when i execute the command cordova platform add android : 

Checking Android requirements...
(Error: An error occurred while listing Android targets)

I already try to add my android sdk location in the path variable.

Please help me ! :D

I work on Windows 7 64 bits, i install the android API 17, 18 and 19 with the android SDK.
I am on 3.2 phoneGap version.

A:To work, this cordova command needs to use some programs located into your sdk/tools directory. You need also have installed apache ant.

Then you must add these directories into your PATH system variable:

Background:


let's assume you have installed your Android SDK to the c:\\sdk\\android directory
you have installed you Apache ant to the c:\\tools\\apache-ant directory


Then you must create two system variables:


ANDROID_HOME with the c:\\sdk\\android value
ANT_HOME with the c:\\tools\\apache-ant value


Finally, you must modify the PATH variable and add those two to the end of the PATH' value: 

;%PATH%\\tools;%ANT_HOME%\\bin;%ANDROID_HOME%\\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\\platform-tools


NOTE: for those who uses Linux, the instruction differs a bit.
