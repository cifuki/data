Q:I've just uploaded a new app to the android market. However when I try to download it to my phone through the Android market, it doesn't appear!

Please can someone with knowledge of this let me know how I can get my app to appear in the search results.

A:This should be instantaneous (at least it usually is for me).
Is the app not offered to you at all? Could one of your settings in AndroidManifest.xml prevent it from being offered to you by the market?
