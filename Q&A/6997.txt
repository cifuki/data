Q:I am working with finger print authentication using android 6.0 api. 
My requirement is, if current device is supports finger print authentication, then I will go through finger print authentication else will use normal way to login the application.

So, any one can tell me, how to check device compatibility for finger print authentication in android.

Thanks in advance.

A:You have to use method isHardwareDetected on FingerprintManager class.


  Determine if fingerprint hardware is present and functional. Returns
  true if hardware is present and functional, false otherwise.


// Check if we're running on Android 6.0 (M) or higher
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    //Fingerprint API only available on from Android 6.0 (M)
    FingerprintManager fingerprintManager = (FingerprintManager) context.getSystemService(Context.FINGERPRINT_SERVICE);
    if (!fingerprintManager.isHardwareDetected()) { 
        // Device doesn't support fingerprint authentication     
    } else if (!fingerprintManager.hasEnrolledFingerprints()) { 
        // User hasn't enrolled any fingerprints to authenticate with 
    } else { 
        // Everything is ready for fingerprint authentication 
    }
}


Don't forget to add permission to access fingerprint functions in AndroidManifest.
Since API 28:

<uses-permission android:name=" android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC" />


Before API28:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />


With Support Library

If you don't want to check Build.VERSION, it's also possible to check on device lower than Android 6.0 with Support Library

Add dependency:

compile "com.android.support:support-v4:23.0.0"


And use FingerprintManagerCompat class as this:

FingerprintManagerCompat fingerprintManagerCompat = FingerprintManagerCompat.from(context);

if (!fingerprintManagerCompat.isHardwareDetected()) { 
    // Device doesn't support fingerprint authentication     
} else if (!fingerprintManagerCompat.hasEnrolledFingerprints()) { 
    // User hasn't enrolled any fingerprints to authenticate with 
} else { 
    // Everything is ready for fingerprint authentication 
}
