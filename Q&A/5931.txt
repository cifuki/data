Q:If I have an apk can I remove the current signing and some how re-sign it with a different .keystore file and still have the application install?

Update: I managed to get it to work with Jorgesys' solution and where I messed up before was that I unzipped the .apk then rezipped it after removing the META-INF folder and changed the file extension back into .apk. What I should have done is simply opened it with winzip and delete the folder inside of winzip.

A:try this


  1) Change the extension of your .apk to .zip
  
  2) Open and remove the folder META-INF
  
  3) Change the extension to .apk
  
  4) Use the jarsigner and zipalign with your new keystore.


hope it helps
