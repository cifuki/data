Q:I am trying to put my android app on the market and the last thing I need is a privacy url. The problem is I don't have a website. I just created this app as my first project ever. Is there something I can do to get around this? Can I use a blog site or a facebook page or twitter page? I would really not have to pay for a website and I don't have the time to create my own website right now. I was just hoping to put my app up finally after all this work and I'm stuck. I looked online but cant really seem to find anything without having a website already. I can write my own but it still leaves me with the fact that I don't have a website to post it onto.

Thanks!

A:You can create a free site on Google Sites and create a boilerplate privacy policy if you need that too.
