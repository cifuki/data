Q:I'm using an OnScrollListener to dynamically add items to a ListView when the user scrolls to the bottom. After I add the data to the adapter and call notifyDataSetChanged though, the ListView goes back up to the top. Ideally, I would like to retain the position in the ListView. Any thoughts on how I should go about doing this?

A:Could this be what you want?

// save index and top position
int index = mList.getFirstVisiblePosition();
View v = mList.getChildAt(0);
int top = (v == null) ? 0 : v.getTop();

// notify dataset changed or re-assign adapter here

// restore the position of listview
mList.setSelectionFromTop(index, top);


EDIT 28/09/2017:

The API has changed quite a bit since 2015. It is similar, but now it would be:

// save index and top position
int index = mList.FirstVisiblePosition; //This changed
View v = mList.getChildAt(0);
int top = (v == null) ? 0 : v.Top; //this changed

// notify dataset changed or re-assign adapter here

// restore the position of listview
mList.setSelectionFromTop(index, top);
