Q:I'm using a standard Android Studio directory structure and I created different build types:

buildTypes {
    debug {
        runProguard false
        packageNameSuffix ".debug"
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
    }
    preview.initWith(buildTypes.debug)
    preview {
        packageNameSuffix ".preview"
    }
    release {
        runProguard false
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    }
}


everything compiles fine, but AS doesnt recognize all of the source folders.
Only folders under main and debug are marked as source, folders under preview and release are displayed as normal folders
In effect there is no error checking in those folders



I checked the .iml file and sourceFolder tags were not added.

If I edit the project iml file manually adding the lines:

 <sourceFolder url="file://$MODULE_DIR$/src/preview/java" isTestSource="false" />
 <sourceFolder url="file://$MODULE_DIR$/src/preview/res" type="java-resource" />


It seems to work fine.



...until I sync with my gradle file - which removes the above lines.

Is this a bug in gradle plugin, or am I doing something wrong?

A:You have to switch it in the build variants list, then AS will pick up the appropriate source sets.
