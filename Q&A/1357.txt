Q:Under DDMS, there is a HEAP tab, and then I click my android application under 'Devices'. 
But it said:

Heap updates are NOT ENABLED for this client


How can I enable Heap update for my android application?

A:On the devices tab, there are a bunch of icons starting with a green bug.  To the right of that is the "Update Heap: button which looks like a green cylinder that is half full.  Press that button and the heap tab should be enabled.  Click "Cause GC" to populate the Heap tab.
