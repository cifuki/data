Q:I want to set some vectorDrawables to a ImageView in Android Studio.

I can set png and jpg drawable easily but when i want to set VectorDrawable, it does not work on imageview.

img.setImageResource(R.drawable.ic_home);


ic_home is VectorDrawable and this code doesn't work.

A:If you want to use vector drawables (less OR greater than API 21) just do the following:

Set the image programmatically (e.g. in your activity):

imageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.ic_left_arrow_blue); 


or by XML:

app:srcCompat="@drawable/your_vector_name"


In your app's build.gradle you need to include:

android {
    defaultConfig {
        vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true
    }
}


And for vector support for less then API 21, add the following to onCreate: 

AppCompatDelegate.setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled(true);
