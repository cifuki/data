Q:I am trying to get a GeoPoint for -23.4456 by 45.44334

What values do I pass into the constructor of the GeoPoint as it take Ints only.

A:GeoPoint coordinates are based in microdegrees (degrees * 1e6) -- written here

float lat = -23.4456f;
float lng = 45.44334f;
GeoPoint gp = new GeoPoint((int)(lat * 1E6), (int)(lng * 1E6));
