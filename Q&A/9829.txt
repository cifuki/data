Q:Is it possible to attach multiple onClick listeners to buttons in android? 
Example:

btn1.setOnClickListener(listener1);
btn1.setOnCliclListener(listener2);


And when the button is clicked onClick event of both listener1 and listener2 are triggered?

In normal GUI applications I know that we can attach more than one event handler for an event. Is it possible for android too or is there any restrictions?

A:Android only supports one registered listener in general. However, you can easily create a listener that simply forwards the events to other listeners using the composite pattern.
