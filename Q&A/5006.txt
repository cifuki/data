Q:I want to develop and debug Nexus 5 with ADT (based on Eclipse) in Windows 7 x64. 

As I connect Nexus 5, it appears in Windows in Explorer, so I can transfer files to/from Nexus. Next step I enable USB debugging in Developer options on the phone; the phone shows notification "USB debugging connected", device disappears from Explorer and Windows tries to install a driver and fails. In Device Manager I see Nexus 5 with exclamation mark icon in "Other devices". Then I select Update Driver Software in Device Manager for Nexus 5 > Browse My computer for driver software > provide path to the driver I downloaded from here http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html:
C:\\Program Files\\Android\\usb_driver, check "Include subfolders" and click Next. 

I get the message "Windows could not find driver software for your device". I tried all kinds of tricks suggested on Internet including this topic:
What USB driver should we use for the Nexus 5?

Nothing helps. Any idea how to force Nexus 5 to work on Windows?

Looks like Google released Nexus 5 without providing an updated driver (the last version is dated 07/09/2013, version 8.0 making it useless for developer on Windows platform.

A:Currently experienced this problem with my Nexus 5, when attempting to sideload latest 4.4.1 OTA update via stock recovery.

Solution:


Open Android SDK Manager (in console get to sdk directory then run tools\\android)
Download/install latest USB drivers (under Extras). 
In Windows Device Manager (devmgmt.msc), right click the Nexus 5 device and select Update Driver Software.  
Browse My Computer for driver software > Android SDK Dir > Extras > usb_driver
