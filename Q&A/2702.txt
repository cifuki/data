Q:I have an imagebutton that doesn't respond with a touch animation when it is clicked because it is a static image unlike regular buttons on lollipop which come with the built in ripple effect. I would like to add the material design ripple touch effect to the image but can't seem to find a way to implement it. I can set a color filter over the image but that is not the ripple effect. An example of what I'm trying to do is when you hold an album cover image in Google Play Music and a shadow ripple moves across the image.

A:For even better result: 

<ImageButton
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:src="@android:drawable/ic_button"
    android:background="?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless"
/>
