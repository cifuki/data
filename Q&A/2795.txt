Q:I'm using Windows 7 and Eclipse Helios. I installed all packages successfully and I could run avd on the command line, but Eclipse was not showing the AVD Manager window and my android project. Why?

A:I know its a bit late answer but for future generations - this is how its done:
Click on Window > Customize perspective > Command Groups Availability tab.
Check the "Android SDK and AVD Manager" option and hit the OK button.
