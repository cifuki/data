Q:I want to use Picasso to load three consecutive images one on top of each other in a listview. Using the methods Picasso provides makes this easy. However because these images are loading in at different times it causes a flickering effect as the images come in. For example sometimes image 2 appears before image 1, and when image 1 loads it causes an unnatural stutter. It would be better if I could set the listview's visibility to invisible until all the images are available to be shown. However, there is no callback method I could find for Picasso that would signal when an image has been loaded.

Does anyone know of a solution for this kind of a situation using Picasso?

Thanks

A:The .into method provides a second argument which is a callback to success and failure. You can use this to keep track of when all three have been called and act on their visibility all at once.
