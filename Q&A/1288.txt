A:Update

This answer is, as I write this, nearly eight years old, and about five years stale. But it's still (as I write this) the "accepted" answer, because it answered the question when it was asked.

The newer answer, that applies to the newer Android Studio tools, can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35828035/62 -- it's a great answer with screen shots. If you're using Android Studio, ignore the Eclipse answer below.

Original Eclipse-based Answer

I was searching for the answer to this question, and was unsatisfied with the above answers. But then I found the answer, so here it is for future reference:

To summarize (and clarify), in Eclipse, go to "Debug Configurations". You can find that in the drop-down under the "debug" icon. Select "target", and select a preferred emulator target to launch. Then under "additional emulator command line options," add this:

-partition-size 1024

Then CLOSE the emulator (and remove any devices), and click the debug icon, which will launch the preferred emulator you selected. This is important: Eclipse needs to launch the debugger, not AVD. 

That fixed the problem for me.
