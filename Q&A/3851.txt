Q:I have an app which I am compiling against API level 21:


and then debug it on a real device with API level 23:



The problem is when I try debugging through the Android OS's own classes, I get 'Source code does not match the bytecode'. Why is this happening? The test device the app is running on is API level 23, and the source file being debugged is level 23 as well.


I am really confused. Can anyone explain why I am seeing this message and how I can fix it?

A:There's an open issue for this in AOSP, where some users have given possible solutions:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=225199&sort=-id&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars

The potential solutions given there (as of the date of this post) are:


Click Build->Clean
Disable Instant Run, in Settings->Build, Execution, Deployment
