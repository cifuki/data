Q:While compiling i get the error Error:compileSdkVersion android-21 requires compiling with JDK 7, saying that a newer version of JDK is required.

I'm running on OS X Yosemite with Android Studio v0.8.14

Things I checked : 


Java version :


java version "1.8.0_25"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode)


Inside the JavaVirtualMachine folder I can see only 1.6.0.jdk folder, I cannot find any other folder.
Tried reinstalling JDk 8 and 7!


I'm unable to find the folder location of jvm 1.8, any idea how I can fix there.

A:The Exact Fix for this Issue (Android Studio Users on Mac)

If you have already upgraded to Java 8, please note that the JDK location is now within /Library/Java compared to Java 6's location /System/Library/Java. So to fix this problem, Right click on the Project folder > Project Structure > SDK Location.

Then change JDK location to

/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home


If you have installed a different JDK version (other than Java 8), find out the path using the java_home script first and use the output. Just run,

/usr/libexec/java_home
