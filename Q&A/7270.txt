Q:I am using Android Studio for a project on SVN (usually on Windows PCs).

Lately I want to run this on a Mac, it keep giving the below error:


  Error:The SDK directory '/Users/AhmadMusa/Desktop/[PROJECT PATH]/D:\\Android\\sdk' does not exist.
  Please fix the 'sdk.dir' property in the local.properties file.


I already put the SDK on local.properties file as:


  sdk.dir=/Users/AhmadMusa/Library/Android/sdk


I don't know why it keep adding the (D:\\Android\\sdk) automatically, this is my Windows PC SDK directory, but why it is here now! nothing on code mention any D:\\Android\\sdk.

A:You cannot edit local.properties it is a generated file, right click your project and select 'Open Module Settings' under SDK Location put your location for your SDK.

paste in  /Users/AhmadMusa/Library/Android/sdk

Clean and rebuild your project

Update

Try to delete your local.properties file and create a new one, but do not check it into version control.

Right click top level of project and Create new file 'local.properties' 
then add: sdk.dir=/Users/AhmadMusa/Library/Android/sdk

Clean and build
