Q:I installed Android Studio and I had no problems with that. However, when I tried to run the emulator, it said that Intel HAXM was not installed.

So I found the installer, ran it, and it even though it said my laptop supports it, that it was not enabled. I went, enabled the Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x), but I still got the same message.

I hear something about Hyper-V needs to be disabled, but when I go to Turn Windows features on/off, I cannot find it on that list.

Can someone help me with this?

A:Alright, so I did everything I could possibly find online, and nothing worked. 

So I went to the Intel website, and I downloaded the HAXM installer that they provide (instead of using the one downloaded through Android Studio).

The installation actually went through with this installer and it was installed successfully. Then I open Android Studio, and the emulator finally loaded!

So, for anyone else having this problem, just download the installer directly from the Intel website.
