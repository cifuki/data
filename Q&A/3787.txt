Q:I added the following line to my build.gradle(Module:app):

compile 'com.android.support:design:25.4.0' 


But when executing Gradle I'm getting 

Failed to resolve: com.android.support.design:25.4.0


I got that the support code from the android support design library and added it to a new project. I added it to the dependency section as such: 

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    androidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
    })
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.1'
    compile 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.0.2'
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'

    compile 'com.android.support:design:25.4.0'
}


Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?

A:Important: The support libraries are now available through Google's Maven repository. You do not need to download the support
  repository from the SDK Manager. For more information, see Support
  Library Setup.


Step 1: Open the build.gradle file for your application.

Step 2: Make sure that the repositories section includes a maven section with the "https://maven.google.com" endpoint. For example:

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url "https://maven.google.com"
        }
    }
}


Step 3: Add the support library to the dependencies section. For example, to add the v4 core-utils library, add the following lines:

dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.android.support:support-core-utils:25.4.0"
}
