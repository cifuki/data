Q:I've built a silly app to share among a few friends. No need to put it up on the app-store.

I built the first apk (signed), uploaded it to a web-server and all worked well.

A small issue arose, I fixed it, re-built, signed with the same keystore and uploaded it again. It now seems that I am unable to install from the new apk. The debugger tells me:

signatures do not match the previously installed version


So I uninstalled the old version by opening the app drawer and dragging it onto the "uninstall" button. When opening "Settings -> Apps", I don't see it anywhere anymore. I don't see any traces of the app on my device.

Yet I still get the above error message.

Is it possible some information still lingers on the device somewhere? Is there any way I can verify that?

A:Yes It is possible if somehow your old application is not removed 100% or its data is not removed.

Try:

adb uninstall "com.yourapp.yourapp"


If you don't know exactly what to put as replacement for "com.yourapp.yourapp", then you just open Android studio, Run your app while it is connected to a device and then look at Debug window.

It says: 

 Waiting for device.
 Target device: samsung-sm_t531-xxxxxxxxx
 Uploading file
 local path: C:\\Users\\myapp\\app\\build\\outputs\\apk\\myapp.apk
 remote path: /data/local/tmp/com.myapp.myapp
 Installing com.myapp.myapp
 DEVICE SHELL COMMAND: pm install -r "/data/local/tmp/com.myapp.myapp"
 pkg: /data/local/tmp/com.myapp.myapp
 Success


com.myapp.myapp in this case is the name of the package you must use to uninstall.
