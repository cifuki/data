Update (11/10/14): Genymotion has released 2.3.1 which fixes this issue. https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/changelog/#231



Update (10/21/14): Genymotion replied to my support email and indicated the solution recommended by @plackemacher below is the suggested fix at the moment. They are aware of the issue.



Since upgrading to Lollipop, I'm having adb issues when using a Genymotion emulator. Devices don't show up in Android Studio, and I've also gotten the following error when trying to run adb devices:

$ adb devices

adb server is out of date.  killing...
cannot bind 'tcp:5037'
ADB server didn't ACK
* failed to start daemon *
error:


I'm not sure if it's because of the Lollipop upgrade or coincidence. 

Edit/update: 

Per Chris Satton's comment, I investigated if multiple adb processes were running (ps aux | grep adb), and it looks like it's a Genymotion conflict(?). It looks to include its own version of adb.

A:Try running this:

killall -9 adb


That should remove all running traces of the daemon

Edit: Best solution below 

This issue may be adb incompatibility with the newest version of the platform SDK. The best solution for this issue with Genymotion is to set the Android SDK within Genymotion to your location. This can be found within the Settings page.
