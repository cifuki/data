Q:With Android version  4.4 (KitKat) one can  record Android device's screen with following command using ADB from  commandline. 

adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/demo.mp4


But this only works in Android version  4.4 (KitKat) and 5.0 (Lolipop)

Is there any other command or a way to record a video below Android version  4.4 (KitKat) using ADB?

A:this  only work in KitKat and via ADB only. This not Working below Kitkat

To start recording your device\xe2\x80\x99s screen, run the following command:

adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/example.mp4, This command will start recording your device\xe2\x80\x99s screen using the default settings and save the resulting video to a file at /sdcard/example.mp4 file on your device.

When you\xe2\x80\x99re done recording, press Ctrl+C in the Command Prompt window to stop the screen recording. You can then find the screen recording file at the location you specified. Note that the screen recording is saved to your device\xe2\x80\x99s internal storage, not to your computer.

The default settings are to use your device\xe2\x80\x99s standard screen resolution, encode the video at a bitrate of 4Mbps, and set the maximum screen recording time to 180 seconds. For more information about the command-line options you can use, run the following command:

adb shell screenrecord \xe2\x80\x93-help,
This works without rooting the device. Hope this helps.
