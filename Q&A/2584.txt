Q:I just upgraded to Android Studio 0.2.8 and I am getting an error that says "Default Activity not found" when I try to edit the run configurations.

When I launch Android Studio I get this error "Access is allowed from event dispatch thread only"

The activity I am using is a fragment activity.

So far I've tried rebuilding and invalidate caches/restart. Both were of no use.

Please let me know what I can do to fix the problem.

A:In Android Studio, right click on the project and choose Open Module Settings. Then go to the Sources tab in your module, find the src folder, right click on it and mark it as Sources (blue color).

EDIT: There is no sources tab in later versions of Android Studio, but you can edit the build.gradle file instead: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22028681/1101730 (thanks for comment Josh)
