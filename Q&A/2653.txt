  R cannot be resolved - Android error  




I am having a issue which I have had before and I don't understand the cause. My project and code is fine as it was running yesterday. I have open Eclipse today and the whole project looks like it contains errors.

I believe it is some sort of build path issue. I don't understand why it randomly occurs? But in the code where there is R.Layout.LayoutName there is an issue... can anyone help?

I have tried cleaning and building it, I have tried importing android.R but I didn't have this before,  it then gives and error and says the layout file doesn't exist.

A:Are you targeting the android.R or the one in your own project? 

Are you sure your own R.java file is generated? Mistakes in your xml views could cause the R.java not to be generated. Go through your view files and make sure all the xml is right!
