Q:I have upgraded my Android SDK to version 2.3 and Android Development Tools 8.0.0. Now in Eclipse, I get an error message:


  Could not find C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk-windows\\platform-tools\\adb.exe!


And I don't have that file. How can I fix this? Is it a bug in the Android SDK 2.3 or Android Development Tools 8.0.0?

A:I simply did "Help" -> "Check for uppdates" in Eclipse. Then I checked every update possible (I had 2) accepted, waited for the updates to complete, restarted Eclipse and then everything was fixed!

I had some new build errors after the update, though, saying something like:


  error: Multiple substitutions specified in non-positional format; did you mean to add the formatted="false" attribute


I won't explain the solution to that problem since this post isn't about it!
However; the solution to that problem can be found in the Google Groups group Android Developers post, SDK 2.3: Get "Multiple substitutions specified in non-positional format" error.
