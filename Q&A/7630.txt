A:After some research, I found out it's a known bug and fortunately, the solution is very simple.

from release notes:


  After updating the Android plugin version, you need to stop the Gradle daemon to apply the update (Issue 267099). Otherwise, Gradle sync and builds fail with the following error:
  
  Could not initialize class com.android.ide.common.util.ReadWriteProcessLock, Failed to notify build listener or java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError.
  
  To stop the daemon, you can either:
  
  1- restart Android Studio,
  
  or 
  
  2- enter the following command in the IDE's Terminal window: ./gradlew --stop or for windows   gradlew --stop
  
  Gradle restarts the daemon for you the next time you sync or build your
  project.
