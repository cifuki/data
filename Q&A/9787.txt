Q:I just recently posted my first app to Google Play. When I search for my app, I would see my app name, and underneath the app name it says who published it. In my case, my app says it is published under my full legal name. I would like to change it so that my app says it is published by my company name. How can I go about changing this? I don't mind removing my app from Google Play and uploading a new app if I have to.

A:In the Developer Console, go to Settings, and change the 'Developer Name'.

Note that this name is the same for all of your apps. If you want to keep your name for other apps, you need a separate developer account and file for an app transfer.
