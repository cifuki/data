Q:I just implemented a orientation change feature - e.g. when the layout changes from portrait to landscape (or vice versa). How can I detect when the orientation change event finished.

The OrientationEventListener didn't work. How can I get notifications about layout orientation change events?

A:Use the onConfigurationChanged method of Activity.
See the following code:

@Override
public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);

    // Checks the orientation of the screen
    if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "landscape", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    } else if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT){
        Toast.makeText(this, "portrait", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}


You also have to edit the appropriate  element in your manifest file to include the android:configChanges
Just see the code below:

<activity android:name=".MyActivity"
          android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
          android:label="@string/app_name">


NOTE: with Android 3.2 (API level 13) or higher, the "screen size" also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation. Thus, if you want to prevent runtime restarts due to orientation change when developing for API level 13 or higher, you must declare android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize" for API level 13 or higher. 

Hope this will help you... :)
