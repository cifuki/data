Q:I have setup the android project using cordova command-line-interface with the help of node.js. I have added the required plugin from Github to our project by the following command:

C:Users/Admin/>cordova plugin add https://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin.git

For now it is working fine, but what if they suddenly changes the plugin.So I want to stick with the specific revision of plugin. So how can i get the plugin which is specific to particular revision. Shall i add the revision number or commit number to the above url?
