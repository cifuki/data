Q:My EditText needs to accept input consisting of partial words, names, etc. At least on my HTC Desire, this is difficult since the keyboard wants to suggest and/or correct some entries (e.g., changes "gor" to "for"). I tried setting textNoSuggestions on the view, but that doesn't fix it.

Any simple solution to this?

A:You can do this from the code. Set the input type of the EditText like below:

txtEmail = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.txtEmail);
txtEmail.setInputType(InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS);
