Q:I'm trying to program an Android interface which uses an expandable list on the side and a fragment on the other side so I can load different resources by clicking on the children of the expandable list. But unfortunately I cannot find any good tutorials about this list anywhere. Yes I've look in the API demos and I've made a normal list with a BaseExpandableListAdapter but still, understanding those list well it's kinda hard without a good tutorial, do you have any good one around or info I could check?

A:you can find working example of the expandable list view by following links:


ExpandableListView
Expandable ListView in ANDROID
Android Expandable ListView simple Example in android. 


for click on child, you can handle this way.

getExpandableListView().setOnChildClickListener(new OnChildClickListener() {                
    public boolean onChildClick(ExpandableListView parent, View v,
                int groupPosition, int childPosition, long id) { 
        // your code...
    }
});


Hope this will help you.
Thanks..
