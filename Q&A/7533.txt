Q:I've had success with building an Android app (GUI) that uses a native (JNI) library.

However, now I would like to create an executable that runs from the command line (root privileges) and does not use a GUI at all. How do I build something like that?

A:As of NDK r8d, this can be solved in a much simpler way.


Create a project with the following directory hierarchy:

project/
    jni/
        Android.mk
        Application.mk
        *.c, *.cpp, *.h, etc.

Fill in Android.mk with the following content. The most important thing is the last line. Check the NDK doc for the meaning of the other variables.

 LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_MODULE := name-of-your-executable
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp etc.cpp
LOCAL_CPPFLAGS := -std=gnu++0x -Wall -fPIE         # whatever g++ flags you like
LOCAL_LDLIBS := -L$(SYSROOT)/usr/lib -llog -fPIE -pie   # whatever ld flags you like

include $(BUILD_EXECUTABLE)    # <-- Use this to build an executable.

Go to the project/ directory, and simply type

ndk-build


The result will be placed in project/libs/<arch>/name-of-your-executable.
