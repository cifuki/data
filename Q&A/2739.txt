Q:For some reason auto complete no longer works. for example when writing code using the android bitmap class, when i use the dot operator eclipse would suggest methods for that object instance. how do you turn this feature back on?

thanks mat.

A:I had this same problem. Here is how I solved it.

In Eclipse go to

Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Advanced

And check the boxes labeled "Java Proposals" and hit Apply. 

This solved my problem. Hope it helps.
