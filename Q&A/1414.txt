Q:Can anyone tell where the file explorer is located in Android Studio?

I tried to search in windows menu but there isn't any option like "show view" that used to be in Eclipse.

A:You can start Android Device Monitor from the Android Studio (green robot icon on the toolbar, to the left of the help icon). From the ADM, select the device/emulator, then select the File Explorer tab.
