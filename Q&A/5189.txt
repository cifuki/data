Q:When I opened android studio today, it showed me the following errors:




Then, when after I restart Android Studio, I get these errors:


After I enable "Android Support", and restart, the first two errors show again, and when I restart again, I get this 3rd error again and the "Android Support" plugin is disabled again. (I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling Android Studio)

How can I fix this?

A:For my case this seems to be a rights issue. When starting Android Studio with admin rights no problems occur.

Re-enabling the plugins as admin and starting AS again with my default user does not help.

Edit

I updated to the latest canary.
With the admin user I've installed AS.
I completly removed .AndroidStudio/config, .AndroidStudio/system and .AndroidStudio/plugins beforehand (I use a different location for these files, so I have to replace idea.properties after every installation. While doing this, I've noticed, that they renamed .AndroidStudio to AndroidStudio.2. That gave me the hint to remove those dirs.)
After this, I had no problems, regardless of which User ran AS.
