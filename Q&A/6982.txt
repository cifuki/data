Q:I am not able to import a project in AndroidStudio because of following error:

Unable to load class 'org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.typehandling.ShortTypeHandling'.


I have no idea about the project. Why I am getting this error and how do I fix it.

A:I have had a same problem. And I have found a solution.

Cause

This problem is caused by android gradle plugin does not match for gradle version. 

Solution

Edit build.gradle in project. gradle plugin version must be satisfied requirements for android studio.

dependencies {
   classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'
}


And edit distrubutionUrl in gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. version of gradle must be satisfied requirements for gradle plugin.

distributionUrl=http\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1-all.zip


You can find version compatibilities between android studio, android gradle plugin and gradle in this page
