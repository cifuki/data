Q:I'm working on an android project which displays a progress dialog when the user downloads a file.

But when the user touches the screen, the progress dialog is dismissed without waiting the 100%.
I already tried to use this:

 public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent e) {
        return true;
    } 


But it's not working.

How can I avoid this?

UPDATE 1:

It seems that setCancelable(false) works fine. Thanks you very much for your answers but when the downloading long-lasting and the user decides to abandon it'll be impossible because I already deactivated the back keyCode:

@Override
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK) {
        return true;
    }
    return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
}


How can I figure this out?

A:Use dialog.setCancelable(false);

Example : 

        ProgressDialog dialog = new ProgressDialog(WiFiFinderActivity.this);
        dialog.setMessage("please wait...");
        dialog.show();
        dialog.setCancelable(false);
        dialog.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(false);
