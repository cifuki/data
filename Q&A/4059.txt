A:Download the Linux SDK from the Android website.
Copy the folder to whereever you want to extract the contents.
Open a terminal there, and then run:

sudo apt-get install unzip
sudo tar xvzf android-studio-ide-135.1641136-linux.zip
cd android-studio-ide-135.1641136-linux
./studio.sh




JDK 1.7 is required for Studio 1.0 onwards:


Download the ubuntu zip from the d.android.com and repeat the steps from above
Download the jdk 1.7 by executing the following commands in terminal as mentioned webupd8:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

Open Android Studio and install the SDK tools.


Caveats:


If your system has a 32 bit processor, use Platform Tools r23.0.1.
Refer to this bug for details.


Note: If you are running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, you need to install some 32-bit libraries with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1
