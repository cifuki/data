Q:How can I pass data between a fragment and its container activity? Is there something similar to passing data between activities through intents?

I read this, but it didn't help much:

A:In your fragment you can call getActivity().

This will give you access to the activity that created the fragment. From there you can obviously call any sort of accessor methods that are in the activity.

e.g. for a method called getResult() on your Activity:

((MyActivity) getActivity()).getResult();
