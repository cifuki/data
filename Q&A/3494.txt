Q:I am trying to debug my application using a real device instead on the emulator. When I try to connect, it gives me the message:


  USB device not found


I tried to unplug and plug it again, but it did not work. And I have also enabled USB debugging and unknown sources options in my device. 

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks!

A:If you are on windows, many times it will not recognize the device fully and because of driver issues, the device won't show up.


go to settings
control panel
hardware and sound
device manager


And look for any devices showing an error.
Many androids will show as an unknown USB device.
Select that device and try to update the drivers for it.
