A:this - return self reference
getContext() - return Context
getActivity() - return Activity

Context.


  Quote from original answer :


As the name suggests, its the context of current state of the application/object. It lets newly created objects understand what has been going on. Typically you call it to get information regarding another part of your program (activity, package/application)

Activity

Activity is a Java code that supports a screen or UI. In other words, building block of the user interface is the activity.
Activity class is a pre-defined class in Android and every application which has UI must inherit it to create window. Activity represents the presentation layer of an Android application, e.g. a screen which the user sees. An Android application can have several activities and it can be switched between them during runtime of the application.


  Note : Activity extends Context. Context not an Activity.
