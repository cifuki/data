Q:Has anybody managed to get the Android Emulator working behind a proxy which requires authentication?

I've tried setting the -http-proxy argument to 

http://DOMAIN/USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP:PORT


but am having no success. 

I've tried following the docs to no avail. I've also tried the -verbose-proxy setting but this no longer seems to exist.

Any pointers?

A:I Managed to do it in the Adndroid 2.2 Emulator.

Go to "Settings" -> "Wireless & Networks" -> "Mobile Networks" -> "Access Point Names" -> "Telkila"


Over there set the proxy host name in the property "Proxy"
and the Proxy port in the property "Port"
