Q:I don't understand the meaning, value, or importance of RESULT_FIRST_USER, other than that my own result codes must be greater than 1. Will someone please explain it? RESULT_OK and RESULT_CANCELED make perfect sense to an english speaker. But what in the world of android is RESULT_FIRST_USER? All the documentations says about it is

Start of user-defined activity results.

A:When you finish an activity, you can call setResult(RESULT_CODE) to send back data to another activity. If you don't call this method, the default value will be RESULT_CANCELLED (which equals 0)

Example of returning data:

Intent intent= new Intent();
intent.putExtra("data",data);
setResult(YOUR_RESULT_CODE,intent);
finish();
