Q:I'm trying Firebase-Notification API the service is worked perfect when i send downstream message from console to app, but how to send message to topic registered users ? 

i did in android side 

FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().subscribeToTopic("TopicName");


but when i try send downstream message from console to topic it's says 

This project does not have any topics


EDIT :
i figured  out that after mapping the topic it's take up to 1 day to show up in Firebase Console

A:This is an alternate path.

If you subscribe a client app to an unexisting topic then the topic will also be created without having to call any firebase url request.

It' will also take a couple of hours to appear on Firebase Console.

By using google shared example: https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/tree/master/messaging you can confirm the same.

        FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().subscribeToTopic("news");
        Log.d(TAG, "Subscribed to news topic");
