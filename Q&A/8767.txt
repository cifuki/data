Q:I have a working php server on my android tablet, so I hope it's available somehow to run nodejs also. The source code is available on github, and it can be build on linux also, but I can't really understand, how to build it.

Thanks in advance,

A:The instructions for a build are missing from the website:


Download it:

wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.1/node-v0.8.1.tar.gz
Unpack it:

tar xzf node-v0.8.1.tar.gz
Go to the unpacked folder:

cd node-v0.8.1/
Run

./configure && make && sudo make install


You might need to install some dependencies like g++ or build-essential, curl and libssl-dev first.

There is also a packaged Android port but it doesn't seem to be actively mantained.

edit: apparently you need to modify some build options according to your device. A google search for "node android" + your model should give you more details. Here are they for the G1 and Galaxy S: http://mitchtech.net/node-js-on-android-linux/
