Q:I've looked everywhere for a solution to this, but I can't figure out how to implement it. My OnItemClickListener was disabled somehow on my ListView rows, because I have an ImageButton in the row layout, which takes over the focus. There have been numerous questions I've found, but none of them have gotten me anywhere.

I've checked this question, but I couldn't really make heads or tails of it. I just need a way to get the rows clickable so that I can detect when a row is pressed. Long press and focus work fine.

A:Instead of an OnItemClickListener, add an OnClickListener to each of your views returned from your adapter. You'll need to use setItemsCanFocus setting up your list:

ListView list = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.myList);
list.setAdapter(new DoubleClickAdapter(this));
list.setItemsCanFocus(true);


and then in your Adapter's getView, this will yield a clickable row. The button is assumed to be in the inflated xml.

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    View view = View.inflate(context, R.layout.cell, null);
    view.setClickable(true);
    view.setFocusable(true);
    view.setBackgroundResource(android.R.drawable.menuitem_background);
    view.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            new AlertDialog.Builder(context).setTitle("touched").show();
        }

    });
    return view;
}
