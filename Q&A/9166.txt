Q:How do you unit test Parcelable?  I created a Parcelable class, and wrote this unit test

TestClass test = new TestClass();
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putParcelable("test", test);

TestClass testAfter = bundle.getParcelable("test");
assertEquals(testAfter.getStuff(), event1.getStuff());


I purposely try to fail the test by returning null in the createFromParcel(), but it seems to succeed. It looks like it doesn't get parceled until it's needed. How do I force the Bundle to..bundle?

A:I've found this link showing how you can unit test a parcelable object:
http://stuffikeepforgettinghowtodo.blogspot.nl/2009/02/unit-test-your-custom-parcelable.html

You can actually skip the Bundle if you don't really need to include it like zorch did his suggestion. You would then get something like this:

public void testTestClassParcelable(){
    TestClass test = new TestClass();

    // Obtain a Parcel object and write the parcelable object to it:
    Parcel parcel = Parcel.obtain();
    test.writeToParcel(parcel, 0);

    // After you're done with writing, you need to reset the parcel for reading:
    parcel.setDataPosition(0);

    // Reconstruct object from parcel and asserts:
    TestClass createdFromParcel = TestClass.CREATOR.createFromParcel(parcel);
    assertEquals(test, createdFromParcel);
}
