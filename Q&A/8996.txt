Q:Is it possible to load a URL in a WebView and resize it to fit the screen? I mean I want to make the WebPage small so that the user doesn't need to scroll. Is this possible?

A:You can also try setting an layout algorithm for the same.It worked for me

webview.getSettings().setLayoutAlgorithm(LayoutAlgorithm.SINGLE_COLUMN);
