Q:I'm trying to run NDK to compile native code to run on Atom(x86) processor as well as ARM.  No matter how I set APP_ABI, NDK is generating armeabi library.  Even if I put only x86 for APP_ABI.  And the file size is always the same.  here is my Application.mk file:

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
APP_ABI := x86
include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_LDLIBS    := -L$(SYSROOT)/usr/lib -llog 
LOCAL_MODULE    := myjni-jni
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := myjni-jni.c

include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)


No Matter what I put after APP_ABI I am getting armeabi and its always same size.  Whats wrong here? I am using latest NDK.

A:You should put APP_ABI variable in Application.mk file not Android.mk file.

It's written in documentation of NDK (docs/CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html file).
