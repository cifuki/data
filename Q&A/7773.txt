Q:I created a new project in Android Studio 0.8 in order to start integrating Android Wear into one of my apps. I create a new project and include the Wear form factor, but when I try to sync I get:


  Error:Could not find any version that matches com.google.android.support:wearable:+.
  Required by:
      win_control:wear:unspecified


EDIT: I played around with Gradle a bit, and now I get these errors:


  Error:Failed to find: com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:+
  Open in Project Structure dialogOpen File
  
  Error:Failed to find: com.google.android.support:wearable:+

A:Had the same problem. Open up your Android SDK manager, go to tools -> manage add on sites, and add your own repo:

https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/addon-play-services-5.xml

I finally found these helpful guides. There are lots of broken links and bad info floating around, but these should work:

http://developer.android.com/preview/google-play-services-wear.html

then,

http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/creating.html

Also, double check your android sdk manager to make sure you have all the latest updates, as well as the android support repository/libraries!
