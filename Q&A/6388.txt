Q:Is there any way to get the ViewGroup from a view? I'm trying to create a custom array adapter and it needs the viewgroup

A:Depending on which ViewGroup you are after, you can get the parent of your view and cast it to a ViewGroup:

(ViewGroup)view.getParent() // this can be done to get any level in your view hierarchy 


or you can cast the view itself as a ViewGroup:

(ViewGroup)view


Basically, find the view you want in your view hierarchy and cast it to ViewGroup
