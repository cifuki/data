Q:I'm writing my first Android app for a small business that has some Droid phones. I set up an AVD for the phone with the right resolution: 854 pixels high. 

I'm working on a MacBook Pro with a max screen resolution 900 pixels high, so when the emulator starts up, the bottom is cut off. 

Is there a way to scale the emulator display down to 75% or something so that it fits on my screen? Any other solution (other than running everything on the phone itself)?

A:From within Eclipse:


Go to Window > Android SDK and AVD Manager > Virtual Devices
Select the AVD you want to launch and click Start
Check the Scale display to real size button
Enter how big you want it to appear in inches and press Launch.  For this to work, you'll have to also enter a reasonable approximation of your mac's screen resolution.  I'm using 7 inches and 113 dpi for my 13" Macbook Pro, but you may be able to get away with 8 or 9 inches.
