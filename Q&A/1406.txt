Q:I try to deploy my app and sometimes get this error: 

Failure 
[INSTALL_FAILED_CONTAINER_ERROR] 


I tried to google it but don't find what the error means or what it's 
caused by. I deploy via IDE (IntelliJ) the file gets copied to the 
device to the /data/local/tmp (unrooted Huawei Ideos, running 2.2), 
but the package manager doesn't seem to like it. Before installing the 
apk, I already removed the app from the device beforehand. I also made 
sure there was no old file under /data/local/tmp on the device. Still 
I'm getting this error now. 
The package should be signed with the debug key, since I deploy via 
IDE by 'running' the app. 

$ pwd 
/data/local/tmp 
$ ls -l 
-rw-rw-rw- shell    shell    17257686 2011-04-21 20:31 
com.company.shop 
$ pm install -r com.company.shop 
        pkg: com.company.shop 
Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_CONTAINER_ERROR]


What does it mean and how to resolve it?

Edit/Update:

I can avoid the error when not allowing the app to be installed on sdcard, setting

android:installLocation="internalOnly"


in the manifest. It's ok for development, but for production, it's not really what I want - since my app is quite large with 17mb; therefore I prefer it to be on sdcard.
How to ever be able to install it on the external memory without rooting (since this is the only way I could delete /mnt/secure/asec/smdl2tmp1.asec, which seems to be one solution as well).

A:remove this file from your device

/mnt/secure/asec/smdl2tmp1.asec


Edit/Update by Mathias Conradt (OP):

If you don't have root access, you need to mount the sdcard and remove it via pc:

/.android_secure/smdl2tmp1.asec
