Q:I'm quite new to Android and have been using an AVD to debug my app so far. However, I want to start checking the media options and therfore need to start using my Android phone. How do I get Eclipse to load my app to my phone instead of my AVD?

A:First you need to enable USB debugging on your phone, then connect it to your computer via USB. Then eclipse should automatically start debugging on your phone instead of the AVD.
