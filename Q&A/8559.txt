Q:There is a problem in Eclipse when I run my Android application:


  An internal error occurred during: "Launching New_configuration (1)".
  Path for project must have only one segment.

A:You must specify project name in settings (see the image) and change android SDK suitable with your version.

Go to Run>Run Configuration

It will bring up the following screen. 
You can enter the project name manually or click browse and select the project to add the name automatically.
