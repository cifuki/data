Q:im trying to get images displayed in a GridView and get the columns automatically set, so far I've had to manually set the number of columns which is not what i want to do as this will affect how big the images are on different sized screens. I ahve tried setting it to auto_fit but it only displays 2 columns in the middle of the screen. This is what im trying to achieve: (Each red square represents an image)



then when turned to landscape mode i want the columns to auto fit so that its all even.
Any help would be much appreciated, thank you :)

A:Experiment with the GridView attributes, specifically android:numColumns="auto_fit" and android:stretchMode. The following works for me:

<GridView 
    android:id="@+id/myGrid"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:padding="10dp"
    android:verticalSpacing="10dp"
    android:horizontalSpacing="10dp"
    android:numColumns="auto_fit"
    android:columnWidth="60dp"
    android:stretchMode="columnWidth"    
    android:gravity="center"
/>
