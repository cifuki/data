Q:I'm curious as to how I could figure out the API URL an Android application (any app I have installed) uses if it makes API calls to some online server (a RESTful service for example). I presume I have to capture packets on the device and maybe analyse them in Wireshark or something to find the URL? I'm fairly competent in Java/Android development, but a bit lost when it comes to any sort of network analysis business.

A:you can do this with help of WireShark. I am listing steps here  


Install WireShark on your computer
now we have to create Android virtual device(AVD) so we will download Android SDK from official site. Android SDK come with emulator for testing 
after setting up Android SDK, create a Android virtual Device(AVD) on which we will install app
start that virtual device. you can use command line to start (emulator @<AVD name>)
after creating virtual device install app using adb command adb install app_file_name.apk
now we can start capturing the packets so I will suggest to close other application on your computer which are using network so our captured packets would be more relevant.
now start wireshark with root access 
select interface which you want to capture and click start to start capturing. 


now start using that app so packets will transfer to and fro and wireshark will capture it. 


if you have used app covering all sort of activity then you can stop wireshark to capture packets.
now start main business to analyse packets carefully but not all packets are usefull for our job. so lets filter packets which are relevant for you. lets your IP address is 192.168.0.32 then filter all the packets whose IP is this. so filter expression will be ip.addr==192.168.0.32  apply this filter. still we an apply another filter to list up only relevant packets only so possibly that app is accessing API with HTTP protocol so apply HTTP filter. expression would be http. you can apply both are filter at once ip.addr==192.168.0.32 and http press enter to apply.


see the info carefully for listed packets you will see lot of important details, API keys, cookies etc
