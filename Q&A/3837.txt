Q:I'm updating my SDK Manager in Eclipse, and there are two new downloads:

Android L (API20, L Preview)

Android 4.4W (API20)

I'm confused because they're both referred to as "API 20".  And I'm not sure what the "W" in "4.4W" is referring to.

A:L Developer Preview is the preview of Android 5.0

Android 4.4W is Android Wear SDK
