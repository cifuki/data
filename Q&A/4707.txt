Q:is it possible to gradle to execute task before calling 

gradle build


something like precompile. Someone please help. Is something like this posible and how?

A:You can do it in this way:

task build << {
    println 'build'
}
task preBuild << {
    println 'do it before build'
}
build.dependsOn preBuild


Thanks to that task preBuild will be automatically called before build task.

If you want to run preBuild in configuration phase (previous example run preBuild in execution phase) you can do it in this way:

task build << {
    println 'build'
}
build.doFirst {
    println 'do it before build'
}
