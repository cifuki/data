Q:I have an application on appspot that works fine through regular browser, however when used through Android WebView, it cannot set and read cookies. I am not trying to get cookies "outside" this web application BTW, once the URL is visited by WebView, all processing, ids, etc. can stay there, all I need is session management inside that application. First screen also loads fine, so I know WebView + server interactivity is not broken. 

I looked at WebSettings class, there was no call like setEnableCookies. 

I load url like this:

public class MyActivity extends Activity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);       
    WebView webview = new WebView(this);
    setContentView(webview);      
    webview.loadUrl([MY URL]);
  }
  .. 
}


Any ideas?

A:If you are using Android Lollipop i.e. SDK 21, then:

CookieManager.getInstance().setAcceptCookie(true);


won't work. You need to use:

CookieManager.getInstance().setAcceptThirdPartyCookies(webView, true);


I ran into same issue and the above line worked as a charm.
