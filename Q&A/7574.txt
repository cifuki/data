Q:Do Android Developers Tools support JAVA 7 API up to this date?
I'm trying to build an Android app using JAVA 7 and I was wondering about this thing.

A:While you can write code in Java 7, the Android Systems that run it only support upto Java 6, so 7 features like switch-case on Strings fail.

As of Build tools 19, Java 7 is now supported.
