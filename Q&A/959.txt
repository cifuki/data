A:Again in this issue also I found Instant Run buggy. When I disable the Instant run and run the app again App starts successfully installing in the Device without showing any error Window. 
I hope google will sort out these Issues with Instant run soon.

Steps to disable Instant Run from Android Studio:


  File > Settings > Build,Execution,Deployment > Instant Run > Un-check
  (Enable Instant Run to hot swap code)
