Q:I'm very new on Android development.

I want to create and start an activity to show information about a game. I show that information I need a gameId.

How can I pass this game ID to the activity? The game ID is absolutely necessary so I don't want to create or start the activity if it doesn't have the ID.

It's like the activity has got only one constructor with one parameter.

How can I do that?

Thanks.

A:Put an int which is your id into the new Intent.

Intent intent = new Intent(FirstActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
Bundle b = new Bundle();
b.putInt("key", 1); //Your id
intent.putExtras(b); //Put your id to your next Intent
startActivity(intent);
finish();


Then grab the id in your new Activity:

Bundle b = getIntent().getExtras();
int value = -1; // or other values
if(b != null)
    value = b.getInt("key");
