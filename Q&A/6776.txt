Q:When we try to get nearby cells and their LAC, MNC, signal (and while using other android apps) we are getting signal as negative value (like -85dbm). How should I take this? Should I ignore  -ve sign and take absolute value or -85 is smaller strength than -60?

How this will affect my location finding?

A:The power in dBm is the 10 times the logarithm of the ratio of actual Power/1 milliWatt.

dBm stands for "decibel milliwatts". It is a convenient way to measure power. The exact formula is


P(dBm) = 10 \xc2\xb7 log10( P(W) / 1mW ) 


where


P(dBm) = Power expressed in dBm   
P(W) = the absolute power measured in Watts   
mW = milliWatts   
log10 = log to base 10


From this formula, the power in dBm of 1 Watt is 30 dBm. Because the calculation is logarithmic, every increase of 3dBm is approximately equivalent to doubling the actual power of a signal.

There is a conversion calculator and a comparison table here.
There is also a comparison table on the Wikipedia english page, but the value it gives for mobile networks is a bit off.

Your actual question was "does the - sign count?"

The answer is yes, it does.

-85 dBm is less powerful (smaller) than -60 dBm. To understand this, you need to look at negative numbers. Alternatively, think about your bank account. If you owe the bank 85 dollars/rands/euros/rupees (-85), you're poorer than if you only owe them 65 (-65), i.e. -85 is smaller than -65. Also, in temperature measurements, -85 is colder than -65 degrees.

Signal strengths for mobile networks are always negative dBm values, because the transmitted network is not strong enough to give positive dBm values.

How will this affect your location finding? I have no idea, because I don't know what technology you are using to estimate the location.  The values you quoted correspond roughly to a 5 bar network in GSM, UMTS or LTE, so you shouldn't have be having any problems due to network strength.
