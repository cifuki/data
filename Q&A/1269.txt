Q:I'm using the SQLite with Android, and I want to know the best way to get the generated id of the row I inserted.

A solution I think makes a search after include, but it doesn't look the best way.

A:The insert method returns the id of row just inserted or -1 if there was an error during insertion.

long id = db.insert(...);


where db is SQLiteDatabase.
