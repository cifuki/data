How can I know if the running code is executed on the main thread (UI thread)?
With Swing I use the isEventDispatchThread method...

A:Doesn't look like there is a method for that in the SDK. The check is in the ViewRoot class and is done by comparing Thread.currentThread() to a class member which is assigned in the constructor but never exposed.

If you really need this check you have several options to implement it:


catch the android.view.ViewRoot$CalledFromWrongThreadException
post a Runnable to a view and check Thread.currentThread()
use a Handler to do the same


In general I think instead of checking whether you're on the correct thread, you should just make sure the code is always executed on the UI thread (using 2. or 3.).
