Q:I need to get the duration of an audio file for a series of voice announcements that need to play from an app.  I have added the audio files as resources and they do play just fine.  The sample code below actually works perfect for its intended purpose: it does return the duration of the audio files.  

Here is the code:

float getDurationOfAudioResource(LocationEnum loc, Context context){
    float  duration = 0;
    try {
        MediaPlayer mp; 
        mp = MediaPlayer.create(context, getAudioResource(loc));
        duration = mp.getDuration();
        mp.release();
        mp = null;
    }
    catch (IllegalStateException e) {e.printStackTrace(); logError(25, "TestDescItem:Fault::Could not open mediaplayer object with audio resource.");} 
    return duration;
}


Here's the weird thing.  This code is called in a Main activity that prepares the set of audio instructions for a given test.  There are no errors within this activity. But as soon as the Second activity is called, I get a long string of errors on logcat.

I've single-stepped upto the end of the Main activity (no errors) and from the first line of the Second activity.  The errors definitely are thrown between the activities.
Also, if I comment out the eight lines of the try block (thus returning only zero) the logcat errors are avoided.  When I restore the eight lines the errors come back.
I've dug through the documentation and searched the web, and I believe that I am correctly constructing, releasing and destroying the mediaplayer object, so I can't see why i am getting an error.
That said, I must be doing something wrong.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Kevin

A:Just put mp.reset(); before mp.release();.
