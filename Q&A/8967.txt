Q:I have a problem that I just cannot figure out. I am using Eclipse to create my own Content Provider but keep getting the following error:


  [..] ERROR/ActivityThread(1051): Failed to find provider info for
  my.package.provider.countrycontentprovider


Code found here: http://codepad.org/Rx00HjHd

Main parts:

public class CountryContentProvider extends ContentProvider {

    public static final String PROVIDER = 
         "my.package.provider.countrycontentprovider";
    public static final Uri CONTENT_URI = 
         Uri.parse("content://" + PROVIDER + "/country");
    // ...
    @Override
    public boolean onCreate() { return true; }
    // ...
}


// from my activity
ContentResolver resolver = getContentResolver();
Cursor c = resolver.query(CountryContentProvider.CONTENT_URI, 
                                  null, null, null, null);  

// AndroidManifest.xml
<provider
    android:name="my.package.provider.CountryContentProvider"
    android:authorities="my.package.provider.countrycontentprovider" />


I have added the provider to the manifest and return true from the onCreate function. I use the CountryContentProvider.CONTENT_URI in my activity to get the Content from my provider, but I just keep getting that error message. I have removed and added the code three times (in case of eclipse melt down) to no avail.
I must be missing something. Can someone point me in the right direction?

A:I was able to reproduce your problem when I moved <provider> out of the <application>...</application> tag. Eclipse didn't say anything like error or warning.

Fortunately this issue is detected by Android Lint starting from ADT 20.
