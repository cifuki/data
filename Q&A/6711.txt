Q:I have to show a drawable from res into an ImageView. In this app, I'm using Picasso for some reasons.

In this case, I need to load the drawable using its URI and not its id.
To do that, here is my code:

uri = Uri.parse(ContentResolver.SCHEME_ANDROID_RESOURCE + "://"+context.getPackageName()+"/drawable/" + drawableName);


where drawableName used here are file names rather than their resource ids.

Then

Picasso.with(context).load(uri).into(imageView);


I know for sure that drawable name is correct, but Picasso seems it does not like this uri.

A:If the images is in your drawable folder then you can just load it.

Picasso.with(context).load(R.drawable.drawableName).into(imageView);


and picasso will load it no need for an Uri.
