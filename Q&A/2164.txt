Q:I am using an EditText and I am validating it with setError property of EditText  and it validates correctly. But I have an button in the same screen that redirects to another activity. And when I press back button and come back to the screen the validation still appears. So on the activity OnPause event I want to remove the validation of the EditText. How is it possible.

A:protected void onPause () {
    TextView textView = ...; // fetch it as appropriate
    textView.setError(null);
}


Because as mentioned in the documentation:


  If the error is null, the error message and icon will be cleared.
