Q:Android Studio (Beta) 0.8.6 gets stuck when I try to build/run the project, as well as clean it. It stays responsive, but the Gradle: Executing Tasks message doesn't disappear (longer than 20 minutes is when I give up) and the app never runs.

This is what I attempted:


Invalidate caches/restart
Force quit and restart
Remove it from Applications (on Mac) and re-download it from the official website.

A:Fixed it by going to Android Studio -> Preferences -> Gradle -> and ticking Offline work. Still have no idea what was wrong, but at least now it compiles.

Edit: 
In new Android Studio Versions the path is File -> Other Settings -> Default Settings -> Build-Excecution-Deployment -> Gradle
