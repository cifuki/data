Q:Possible Duplicate:
  Admob Error in Eclipse for android:configChanges  




I want to display AdMob's ads in my android application.
I do all the necessary like in the doc.
But I can't run my app because there is an error on my AndroidManifest.xml on this line : 

<activity android:name="com.google.ads.AdActivity"
              android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize"/>


The error is : 

error: Error: String types not allowed (at 'configChanges' with value 'keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|
 screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize').


But if I delete some value my app is running but instead of the ads I've this text : "You must have AdActivity declared in AndroidManifest.xml with configChanges."

I don't unterstand how I can fix the problem.

I'm using android SDK 2.1 and the last google adMob SDK 4.3.1

Thanks

A:To fix the problem you have to set your project build target to Android 3.2 or higher, see the requirements section in the documentation (Android tab).
