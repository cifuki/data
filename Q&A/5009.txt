A:There is a good description of code style rules here. 

If you want to enforce this rules without remembering all of them, and you are using eclipse then you can use formatting rules provided by Android team:  android-formatting.xml. Just import it into eclipse using Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter, click Import.
