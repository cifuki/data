Q:When going here:  right-click on my project > Properties > Android the below error happens.



This error happens when I go to Properties > Android on the project or either of the libraries (ignore BibleTriviaPro).

This error seems to have came out of nowhere.  I cannot think of anything I have changed and now all of a sudden tonight this error comes up.  How can I fix this?

A:I was having the same error this morning strange as everything was fine last night. 

Try cleaning all projects in workspace then restart eclipse - worked for me
