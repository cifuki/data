Q:I was just building some UI in xml, and Lint gave me a warning and said to set android:baselineAligned to false to improve performance in ListView.

The docs for the Lint changes that added this warning say


  Layout performance: Finds LinearLayouts with weights where you should
  set android:baselineAligned="false" for better performance, and also
  finds cases where you have nested weights which can cause performance
  problems.


Can somebody explain why this improves performance, specifically when weight is involved?

A:By setting android:baselineAligned="false" , you're preventing the extra work your app's layout has to do in order to Align its children's baselines; which can obviously increase the performance. (Fewer unnecessary operations on UI => Better performance)
