Q:I've added a RatingBar in a layout:

<RatingBar 
    android:id="@+id/ratingbar"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:numStars="5"
    android:stepSize="1.0"
    />  


But the default style for the rating bar is too large.
I've try to change it by adding the android style : style="?android:attr/ratingBarStyleSmall"

But the result is too small and it's impossible to set a rate with this property.

How could I do?

A:The default RatingBar widget is sorta' lame.

The source makes reference to style "?android:attr/ratingBarStyleIndicator" in addition to the "?android:attr/ratingBarStyleSmall" that you're already familiar with.  ratingBarStyleIndicator is slightly smaller but it's still pretty ugly and the comments note that these styles "don't support interaction".

You're probably better-off rolling your own.  There's a decent-looking guide at http://kozyr.zydako.net/2010/05/23/pretty-ratingbar/ showing how to do this.  (I haven't done it myself yet, but will be attempting in a day or so.)

Good luck!

p.s. Sorry, was going to post a link to the source for you to poke around in but I'm a new user and can't post more than 1 URL.  If you dig your way through the source tree, it's located at frameworks/base/core/java/android/widget/RatingBar.java
