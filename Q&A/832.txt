Q:When compiling a specific Android project, and only on my Windows machine, I get a java.nio.BufferOverflowException during from dex. The problem occurs both when using Eclipse and when using Ant.

The output when using Ant is:

...

When using Eclipse the message is shorter but similar:

[2013-11-01 14:29:44] APK file is not created for Project: 
[2013-11-01 14:29:46 - Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: java.nio.BufferOverflowException. Check the Eclipse log for stack trace.

Like I said, I don't have this problem on my MacBook, even though they are both upgraded to the latest versions of the Android Build tools: 19.0.0.

A:No need to downgrade the build tools back to 18.1.11, this issue is fixed with build tools 19.0.1.

If you can't use 19.0.1 for some reason then:

Make sure that the value of android:targetSdkVersion in AndroidManifest.xml matches target=android-<value> in project.properties. If these two values are not the same, building with build tools version 19.0.0 will end in the BufferOverflowException. Source

There is also some indication from comments on this post that you need to target at least 19 (android-19). Please leave a comment if this solution also works if your target is < 19.

This is how the fix looks for my project. The related AOSP issue is #61710.

1 If you really need to downgrade, you don't need to uninstall build tools 19.0.0, simply install 18.1.1 and add sdk.buildtools=18.1.1 to the local.properties file.
