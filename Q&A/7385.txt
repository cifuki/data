Q:I'm trying to pop-open a DatePicker dialogue box when my EditText is clicked. The problem is, when I try to instantiate my Calender object with Calender.getInstance() the creepy-red-underline appears below getInstance().

Calender myCalender = Calender.getInstance();


Hover over it and it says


  Call requires API level 24(current minimum is 15).


Obviously I expect my app to run on devices at the minimum API level 15. Please help me with this, I'm new to Android. Thank you.

I tried to follow this method to add a DatePicker to my EditText

A:You have the wrong import statement for Calendar. It needs to be java.util.Calendar. My guess is that you have an import for android.icu.util.Calendar.
