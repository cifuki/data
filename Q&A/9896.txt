Q:My country is not supported by Google for a Merchant account so I can't publish paid apps. But I would like to get some donations from my users. I know that Google says in their policy that all payments must go through Google Play.

How about donations? Can I use a donation button, which links to PayPal to accept donations? Or can I use the PayPal Mobile Payment Libraries (MPL) to accept donations?

  Thank you for contacting the Google Play Team.
  
  I see that your question is regarding accepting donations through
  PayPal. Donations may only be collected within an app under certain
  conditions: 
  
  
  Donations are only permitted for validated non-profit charitable organizations (for example, a validated 501(c)(3) charitable
  organization or the local equivalent).
  Donations must be facilitated via a web browser, and any collection must be made through a secure payment system.
  
  
  If you belong to an eligible charitable organization, please follow
  these steps:
  
  
  Attach a copy of your organization\xe2\x80\x99s IRS determination letter or other acceptable proof in your reply to this notification. The
  provided information must indicate your status as a charitable
  organization.
  Ensure your app only facilitates donations via a web browser as specified above.
  Submit your app for review.
  
  
  Alternatively, if you are not a charitable organization, you must
  remove the donation functionality from your app, or accept payment
  through Google Play's in-app billing service or Paid app distribution
  on the Play Store. You can learn more about in-app billing in our Help
  Center: http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/index.html
  
  I hope this helps. Thank you for your support of Google Play.
