A:There are multiple ways: 


If you don't use eclipse, you can use adb tool. adb -d install PATH_TO_YOUR_APK_FILE
If you use eclipse, you can click run application in eclipse's launch menu. If this doesn't work, make sure you have "USB Debugging Mode" checked on your android phone. It's in the application menu.
You can export your package and sign it! And then browse to it to install.
