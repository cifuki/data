Q:On click of a button I want to start service using method startService(new Intent(currentActivity.this,MyService.class)) but if service is running I don't want to call  this method to avoid run service that is already running.How this is possible.I am using both Intent service and Service in same project and want to apply same condition for both.

A:A service will only run once, so you can call startService(Intent) multiple times.

You will receive an onStartCommand() in the service. So keep that in mind.

Source:
Note that multiple calls to Context.startService() do not nest (though they do result in multiple corresponding calls to onStartCommand()), so no matter how many times it is started a service will be stopped once Context.stopService() or stopSelf() is called; however, services can use their stopSelf(int) method to ensure the service is not stopped until started intents have been processed.
