Q:I'm looking for some "Feature Graphic" online generator. Feature Graphic is the big image displayed in the web-based Android Market. 

It could be something simple and it could look like one for this app: https://market.android.com/details?id=menion.android.locus

I would input screenshots, title and some slogan and it would generate nice feature graphic. I think many Android developers would appreciate such service.

A:As of 31st Aug 2014 feature graphic is mandatory and handily there's a generator Created by Litrik De Roy here. 


  The Android Feature Graphic Generator allows you to easily create a
  simple yet attractive feature graphic for your Android application. It
  will generate a PNG image file according to Google's guidelines.
  Afterwards you can upload the image to the Google Play Developer
  Console to spice up the listing of your Android app.
