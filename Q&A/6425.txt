Q:I looked at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html to figure out the differences but could not understand much. I only partly understood the "selected" state.

Can somebody explain the differences with some solid examples? I hope my question is not very vague. If it is, it would be great if somebody helps me to improve it because I don't know how to ask it more clearly.

Thank you in advance.

A:Enabled -> User Interaction possible. 

Disabled -> User interaction not possible.


if you hover the mouse over a widget, it is focussed
If you make a press-down (half click) on that widget, it is pressed
If you press-down and press-up while the mouse is at the same position, it is selected
