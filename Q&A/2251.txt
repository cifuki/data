Q:I am trying to add Android Q using AVD manager but it says: "Package "Android Emulator" with revision at least 28.1.9 not available." Has anyone tried this before? Please, say me, what should I do now.

A:Thanks to @JulianC I also set the emulator. I tried to download it standalone from the official site, but couldn't. Then switched to Canary Channel. I pressed Tools > SDK Manager, then Updates label and changed channel. Also pressed Check Now button and dismissed a dialog (Remind Me Later).



Then switch to Android SDK and updated needed emulators.




Then reverted back to Stable Channel.

After several days of work I faced some visual bugs in the emulator. Sometimes I have to restart virtual devices from AVD Manager with Cold Boot Now:



Sometimes I recreate virtual devices in AVD Manager.
