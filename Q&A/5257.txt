Q:I'm trying to update the menu buttons of my app every time one of them is pressed; in API 11+, you need to call invalidateOptionsMenu() to do this; since I want my app to be compatible with lower APIs, how do I only call this method when using api 11+?

A:Use

ActivityCompat.invalidateOptionsMenu(Activity activity)


from the compatibility library.
