Q:The new Android Studio allows for better Android development with better tools. I see a bunch of questions on how to transfer an eclipse project to android studio but what about the other way?

If you make an Android app in Android Studio, can you bring it back to Eclipse? If so, how?

This would be needed for specific eclipse plugins, such as the Blackberry Android plugin.

Thank you.

A:It's not possible. We intend to add support for Gradle-based project in ADT but it's not currently possible.
