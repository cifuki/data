Q:I am trying to build and sign an app manually, but I keep getting INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES when installing to the emulator, before I even succeeded installing once.

Just in case, I have attempted to uninstall the app (yes, I gave the right Java package name), but it didn't solve the problem.

I have also tried restarting the emulator and marking the "Wipe User Data" checkbox.

The package name includes our company name, so it could not clash with internal packages.

I haven't found in the internet any other explanation to the error except for "you have another version of the same app already installed", so I'm kind of stuck here.

Thanks!

A:Maybe it's not signed correctly? Try to build it with Eclipse or the SDK Ant tasks and compare the APKs. Or use jarsigner to check the signature and make sure it's what you expect.
