Q:How do you disable all touch events in an Android WebView (or scrolling in particular)? I would like the activity to handle all touch events.

A:mWebView.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
        return true;
    }
});


Disables all touch events on a WebView because the touch listener is executed before the default touch behavior of the WebView. By returning true the event is consumed and isn't propagated to the WebView. 

Using android:clickable="false" does not disable touch events.
