Q:I installed Android Studio 0.1.9.  Today I got and update to version 0.2 and of course I updated. After the installation I restarted Android Studio but now I get this message:


  Project is using an old version of the Android Gradle plug-in. The
  minimum supported version is 0.5.0. Please update the version of the
  dependency 'com.android.tools.build:gradle'


How do I do that? I can't find any update tools for the gradle plugin in android studio.
