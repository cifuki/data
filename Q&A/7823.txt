Q:I have created a new project using the latest version of Android Studio (0.2.2), this is a fresh install of studio. When I am in the project explorer view, it fails to show me any folders for my project. I should see a root project folder, and within it the .idea, gradle, and module folders, but they are not showing.

Here is what I expect to see (taken from the sample project created on first boot):



But here is what I see immediately after the project's creation:



I cannot figure out how to expose my project's folders! I do not want to develop without the project explorer, it's simply too much of a hassle. Did I create the project incorrectly, or am I missing some not-so-obvious setting somewhere?

Thanks.

A:The problem here is that I assumed android studio would create a module for the application. I assumed this because it asked me at the beginning for app name, module name, package, sdk info etc.

This assumption turned out to be false. You must create your first module manually through File > Project Structure. After that is done, the project explorer shows the files.
