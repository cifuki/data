Q:I have to use a grid to implement Photo Browser in Android, and I want to know the difference between GridView and GridLayout. 

I'm using GridView to display the images dynamically.

A:A GridView is a ViewGroup that displays items in two-dimensional scrolling grid. The items in the grid come from the ListAdapter associated with this view.

This is what you'd want to use (keep using). Because a GridView gets its data from a ListAdapter,  the only data loaded in memory will be the one displayed on screen.
GridViews, much like ListViews reuse and recycle their views for better performance.

Whereas a GridLayout is a layout that places its children in a rectangular grid.

It was introduced in API level 14, and was recently backported in the Support Library.
Its main purpose is to solve alignment and performance problems in other layouts.
