Q:I'd like to use the new CardView widget that was introduced with the new Android L Developer Preview Support Library (As mentioned here), which seems to be part of a new revision of the v7 support library.

I have now updated my SDK version, downloaded the newest Support Library package, but I still cannot find the new CardView widget.

I already searched the web and the official docs, but could not get any hints on where I can get the new support library.

Any help is highly appreciated!

EDIT: I'm using ADT/Eclipse

A:Using Gradle or Android Studio, try adding a dependency on com.android.support:cardview-v7.

There does not seem to be a regular Android library project at this time for cardview-v7, leanback-v17, palette-v7, or recyclerview-v7. I have no idea if/when Google will ship such library projects.
