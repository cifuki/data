Q:According to this answer How to solve "Your APK's version code needs to be higher than 2." in Google Play's Developer Console? I have just changed the version code from 2 to 3 and it failed to upload the build.

This is my old manifest before I uploaded the apk

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="mypackage name"
    android:installLocation="auto"
    android:versionCode="28"
    android:versionName="1.0028" >

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="8"
        android:targetSdkVersion="19" />
        .....


here is the new version code which I have to upload on android developer console. See my menifest

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="mypackage name"
    android:installLocation="auto"
    android:versionCode="2"
    android:versionName="2.0001" >

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="8"
        android:targetSdkVersion="19" />
        ......


I dont know whats the issue. Any help?

A:android:versionCode="28"


Your previous versionCode was 28. You should increment it by 1 to 29.

android:versionCode="29"


Presumably, your previous app versions were 1 through 28. By releasing with versionCode 3, you are conflicting with a previous version of your app that was already released with this versionCode.
