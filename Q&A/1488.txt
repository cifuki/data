Q:Logcat allows filtering logs but it works like that: You define filters and logcat only displays messages which matches filters. But is there a way to display all logs EXCEPT some TAGs defined by filters?

A:If you are using adb logcat you could pipe it through grep and use it's inverted matching:
From the grep manpage:


  v, --invert-match
          Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.


For example: 

$adb logcat | grep --invert-match 'notshownmatchpattern' 


You can extend this by using regular expressions.

Here is an example of such an expression:

"/^(?:emails|tags|addresses)"


This one would check for either of the given to occur, grep would then not list them.
