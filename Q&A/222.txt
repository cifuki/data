I had issues finding a good solid tutorial on how to setup ADB for Mac. 

How can I add ADB to macOS in such a way that it can be used in the terminal?



Unlike Set up adb on Mac OS X, the intention of this question is to have a tutorial with all of the required installation steps to get ADB on macOS.

A:Option 1 - Using Homebrew

This is the easiest way and will provide automatic updates.


Install homebrew

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Install adb 

brew cask install android-platform-tools

Start using adb

adb devices





Option 2 - Manually (just the platform tools)

This is the easiest way to get a manual installation of ADB and Fastboot. 


Delete your old installation (optional) 

rm -rf ~/.android-sdk-macosx/

Navigate to https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and click on the SDK Platform-Tools for Mac link. 
Go to your Downloads folder

cd ~/Downloads/

Unzip the tools you downloaded

unzip platform-tools-latest*.zip 

Move them somewhere you won't accidentally delete them

mkdir ~/.android-sdk-macosx
mv platform-tools/ ~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools

Add platform-tools to your path

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/' >> ~/.bash_profile

Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)

source ~/.bash_profile

Start using adb

adb devices



Option 3 - Manually (with SDK Manager)


Delete your old installation (optional) 

rm -rf ~/.android-sdk-macosx/

Download the Mac SDK Tools from the Android developer site under "Get just the command line tools". Make sure you save them to your Downloads folder.
Go to your Downloads folder

cd ~/Downloads/

Unzip the tools you downloaded

unzip tools_r*-macosx.zip 

Move them somewhere you won't accidentally delete them

mkdir ~/.android-sdk-macosx
mv tools/ ~/.android-sdk-macosx/tools

Run the SDK Manager

sh ~/.android-sdk-macosx/tools/android

Uncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)





Click Install Packages, accept licenses, click Install. Close the SDK Manager window.





Add platform-tools to your path

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/' >> ~/.bash_profile

Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)

source ~/.bash_profile

Start using adb

adb devices
