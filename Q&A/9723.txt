Q:I'm trying to make a app with WebView, but the website is using https, but the content (ex. mp3 file) uses http, so Android Lollipop won't load it because it is "Mixed Content". I tried to use onReceivedSslError handler.proceed();, but it doesn't load anything. Is there a way to fix it? or could I just make all websites loaded use http, so It doesn't show any errors?

A:Since Pie (API 29), all non-HTTPS traffic in app is now disabled by default.

If you're targeting API level 26 or above, you must first enable it in the manifest file. Add

android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"


into <application> tag.



Since Lollipop (API 21), WebView blocks all mixed content by default.

To change this behaviour, when you are targeting API level 21 or above, use:

webView.getSettings().setMixedContentMode(WebSettings.MIXED_CONTENT_COMPATIBILITY_MODE);



  In this mode, the WebView will attempt to be compatible with the
  approach of a modern web browser with regard to mixed content. Some
  insecure content may be allowed to be loaded by a secure origin and
  other types of content will be blocked. The types of content are
  allowed or blocked may change release to release and are not
  explicitly defined.


In practice this should allow loading of images, videos, music etc. - all content that has low probability of being major security threat, when tampered/replaced by malicious third-party.



Alternatively use (strongly discouraged):

webView.getSettings().setMixedContentMode(WebSettings.MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW);



  In this mode, the WebView will allow a secure origin to load content
  from any other origin, even if that origin is insecure. This is the
  least secure mode of operation for the WebView, and where possible
  apps should not set this mode.
