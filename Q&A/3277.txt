Q:I have a use case where I need a reference to the parent RecyclerView from inside the adapter, specifically inside the onBindViewHolder method. So far what I am doing is assigning it to a private class member in the onCreateViewHolder method passing along the viewGroup parent arg like so:

private ViewGroup mParent;

@Override
public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
    // inflater logic.
    mParent = parent;
}


And referencing the parent RecyclerView in onBindViewHolder like this:

@Override
public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
    // binder logic.
    ((RecyclerView)mParent).blahBlahBlah();
}


Is there a better way of doing this? Maybe RecyclerView.Adapter has a way that I may have missed?

A:There's actually a specific method that callsback with the RecyclerView that attaches to the adapter.  Just override the onAttachedToRecylerView(RecyclerView recyclerView) method.

public class Adapter_RV extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>{

    RecyclerView mRecyclerView; 


    @Override
    public void onAttachedToRecyclerView(RecyclerView recyclerView) {
        super.onAttachedToRecyclerView(recyclerView);

        mRecyclerView = recyclerView;
    }

    @Override
    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, int position) {

        mRecyclerView....
    }
