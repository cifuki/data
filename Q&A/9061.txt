A:From the docs:


  category -- Gives additional
  information about the action to
  execute. For example,
  CATEGORY_LAUNCHER means it should
  appear in the Launcher as a top-level
  application, while
  CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE means it should
  be included in a list of alternative
  actions the user can perform on a
  piece of data.


MAIN means that this activity is the entry point of the application, i.e. when you launch the application, this activity is created.
