Q:I would like to be able to assign a xml attribute or style to a TextView that will make whatever text it has in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

The attributes android:inputType="textCapCharacters" and android:capitalize="characters" do nothing and look like they are for user inputed text, not a TextView.

I would like to do this so I can separate the style from the content.  I know I could do this programmically but again I want keep style out of the content and the code.

A:I though that was a pretty reasonable request but it looks like you cant do it at this time. What a Total Failure. lol 

Update

You can now use 
textAllCaps
 to force all caps.
