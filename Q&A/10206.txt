Q:According to the following SO post, compile has become implementation recently: What's the difference between implementation and compile in gradle

My question is what should I use instead of compileOnly? The post above does not address that gradle config. I do know that I can still use compileOnly but what is the recommended config that will not be deprecated soon?

It seemed like all configs that contain ..compile.. would be replaced by ..implementation... I tried implementationOnly but not accepted by Android Studio.

A:compileOnly is the replacement â€” the equivalent configuration that is being deprecated is provided. See the documentation.
