Q:I have just updated emulator 26.0.3, now I cannot run adb root command for new created emulator.

the error shown is below:

adbd cannot run as root in production builds

I have killed and restart adbd like:

adb kill-server
adb devices


Nothing helps, any ideas?



I am not sure what is the difference and how to select different build but,
if following settings are enabled while creating, then it has root.

To enable root access, use an emulator image like


  Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image


not


  Google Play Intel x86 Atom System Image


To test it, run adb root. It should say


  restarting adbd as root


or


  adbd is already running as root


not


  adbd cannot run as root in production builds


Alternatively, to test it, run adb shell, and if the prompt ends with $, run su. You should get a # prompt.

Steps: To install and use an emulator image that can run as root:


In Android Studio, use the menu command Tools > AVD Manager.
Click the +Create Virtual Device... button.
Select the virtual Hardware.
Select the System Image. Pick any of these:

Intel x86 Atom System Image

Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image

Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image

Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image.

(Do NOT pick "Google Play ... System Image". Those are the ones that cannot run as root.)
Click the Download button if needed.
Finish creating your new AVD.
Run your new AVD.
