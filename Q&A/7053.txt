A:ScrollView is used to put different or same child views or layouts and the all can be scrolled.

ListView is used to put same child view or layout as multiple items. All these items are also scrollable.

Simply ScrollView is for both homogeneous and heterogeneous collection. ListView is for only homogeneous collection.
