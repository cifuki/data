Q:I recently updated to Android Studio 2.3, and now when I try to run the application, the emulator does not come online. It times out after 300 seconds.

Additionally, The app has been experiencing a FATAL EXCEPTION ERROR (OOM), and I am not sure how to fix that either, or if that is part of the emulator problem. 

Any help is much appreciated. Again, my knowledge in the program is very limited so if your answer can be kept simple, that would be great.

A:I too had the same problem, then I went to AVD manager and right click on the emulator and stopped it and I RUN the application again and this time it worked.
it may be a temporary solution but works for the time being.


  AVD manager-> right-click on the emulator you are using -> Stop


Now Run your application again.

Note: Sometimes closing the emulator directly is not working for the above-mentioned problem but stopping it from the AVD manager as mentioned is working.
