Q:I'm trying to generate a signed apk but I always get the same error.

To run dex in process, the Gradle daemon needs a larger heap.
It currently has approximately 910 MB.
For faster builds, increase the maximum heap size for the Gradle daemon to more than 2048 MB.
To do this set org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048M in the project gradle.properties.


I can\xc2\xb4t file that file but I tried modify gradle-wrapper.properties but I still get the same error.

This is my gradle-wrapper.properties file

#Thu May 05 20:51:44 CEST 2016
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m


I have already try too Android Gradle Could not reserve enough space for object heap

A:Just create a file called gradle.properties in your root project:

root
|--gradle.properties
|--build.gradle
|--settings.gradle
|--app
|----build.gradle


Then add inside the file:

org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m
