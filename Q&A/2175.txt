Q:I got this error while installing the android application (Parse Error : There is a problem parsing the package.). I did the following steps.


First time I installed the application and it works fine.
I made changes to the existing application and change the version no in Manifest file.

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="org.openintents.samples.BasicOpenARDemo" android:versionCode="2" android:versionName="1.0.1">

Then I export the application and finish the code signing process.
For this, Right Click your Project node > select Export. There you will see a wizard. Follow the steps and finish the code signing also.
I got the ARDemo.apk file, Then I changed it\xe2\x80\x99s name to ARDemo1.apk
Then I shipped this apk file to mobiles SD Card and started the installation I got the above error.


I googled, they say that problem with unpacking manifest file.

Can anyone tell me what could be wrong with me?

A:You said that the first time you installed the application it worked fine.

The only difference in the steps you outlined between the two versions are:


The version number (I'm assume
that this did not participate in
breaking anything)
The code
The name of the .apk file


Try renaming the ARDemo1.apk file back to ARDemo.apk (make sure to back up the older version) and see if that helps. My guess is that it has something to do with the name of the apk.

If it still does not work, then you can eliminate the name of the apk file as the source of the problem and start investigating 2) by rebuilding your old version and see if you have same problem again. If the problem does not exists with the rebuilt version of your old code then you know it must be something to do with your code.

I hope that gets you somewhere.
