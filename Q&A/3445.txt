Q:I signed my APK in Android Studio 2.3 (build->generate signed APK). When I'm trying to upload it to Google Play store it is showing the error that I've uploaded unsigned APK. Could anyone answer why it is happening and how to solve it?

A:It uploaded successfully when I checked V1 (Jar Signature) instead of V2 (Full APK Signature) while generating the signed APK in Android Studio 2.3
