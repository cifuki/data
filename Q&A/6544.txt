Q:I have already read some articles and searched on Google, but I failed to do it.

My problem is regarding the font-face.

In Android, there are only 4 attributes in "android:typeface": Normal, Sans, Serif, Monospace.

So what do I have to do to use "Verdana" in my application? 

Please suggest me a correct way to use this font in my Android application.

A:This is a simple example... create a folder in the root of your project called assets/fonts/ then paste the TTF font file (in this case Verdana.ttf). Then, if you want to apply that font to, say a TextView, do the following:

import android.graphics.Typeface;

public class FontSampler extends Activity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle icicle) {
    super.onCreate(icicle);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    TextView tv=(TextView)findViewById(R.id.custom);
    Typeface face=Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(),
                                          "fonts/Verdana.ttf");

    tv.setTypeface(face);
  }
}


This example was taken from the ComonsWare book (written by Mark Murphy). You can download the full example from GitHub.
