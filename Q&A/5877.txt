Q:I need  a PDF library for manipulating  a  PDF documents, (creating PDF, image convertinng to PDF) and  things like that but in Android.

I tried the android itext port but the library project generates compile errors after I added it to my Project. Looks like it is still using some affinetransformation classes that are defined in AWT.

A:It seems that no one of the pure java pdf libraries will work with android because they use libraries that aren't supported by android. I think I read that iText is interested in doing a port to android but thinks that google should support them if they did, haven't got a source on that though. 

Here is a project in work for writing pdfs in android: sourceforge.net/projects/apwlibrary
Haven't tried it and it says that it only does simple pdfs
