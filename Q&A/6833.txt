A:You need to check:


Your size on disk is not full - this's often happen due to creation of some virtual devices that are unused
The RAM size of emulator is not minimum as your requirements


One more thing that I personally use: Use Pen Drive as a RAM

Another work around steps (tested) :

Create new device in your AVD Manager
Increase the RAM size of the Emulator
