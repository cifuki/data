Q:I have integrated my application with Facebook, and for this I am using Facebook's Graph API. I am retrieving profile and friends information. It is working fine on my device which has Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), but recently my client has faced an issue while he is trying to connect to Facebook through my app. He has Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) on his device. When he clicks a button on the app that takes him to the Facebook login screen, after login he gets a message:


  My app is misconfigured for Facebook login. Press Okay to go back to the application without connecting to Facebook.




I am not getting what is the problem whether it is related to Android version or what.

How can I fix this problem?

A:I work at Facebook, and this is an important issue that needs to be addressed. The other answer for this question suggests that disabling SSO is very bad and will open up your app to malicious apps that can steal your user's Facebook credentials.

The hack launches a WebView dialog to Facebook without SSO, and the user must type their login credentials into that dialog. Malicious apps can then steal this information easily. It is always advised to implement Facebook SSO correctly to ensure that your app is secure and protect your user's sensitive data.  

Prior to adding this error message, the dialog would automatically close without warning and fail silently. We added this error message to visually display that there is an issue with your app configuration in your Facebook app dashboard. For Android, if you check your LogCat, you'll see that after pressing "Okay", there should be an error message that will display a more technical description of what is causing the authentication to fail.  

For example, if you use our Hackbook example and did not supply your own APP_ID in the source and did not add your hash key to the dashboard, you'll see this error in LogCat after pressing "Okay" in the native SSO dialog (if Util.ENABLE_LOG is set to true):


  D/Facebook-authorize(24739): Login failed: invalid_key:Android key mismatch. Your key "uk3udeH7vrOGNFH2FJjdJbdWJWI" does not match the allowed keys specified in your application settings. Check your application settings at http://www.facebook.com/developers


We added the visual error message to help you. This, in theory, does not break previous implementations if it was implemented correctly to begin with. If you see this error message, that means you did not configure your app settings correctly on your dashboard.
Double check your Android Class/Package name, Android hash keys, etc.  You will not see this message if you did everything correctly.  

In summary, you are getting that error message because there is an issue with your app configuration, for example, a mismatch between the Android hash keys in your dashboard. Before Facebook added this error message, the dialog would launch, then automatically close and fail.  To fix this, check your LogCat for any error messages and make sure that you have everything implemented correctly. You can read up on our documentation to make sure you have everything correct. Do not use the accepted answer for this question.

You can also follow the external bug report that a Facebook developer has reported for more updates.
