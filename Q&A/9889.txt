Q:Given this code to draw a line:

Paint p;

p = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);
p.setColor(android.graphics.Color.WHITE);
p.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
p.setStrokeWidth(21);

canvas.drawLine(0,50,100,50,p);


there are 3 possible stroke-drawing strategies:


Inside: The line is painted in the rectangle (0,50,100,70)
Center: The line is painted in the rectangle (0,40,100,60)
Outside: The line is painted in the rectangle (0,30,100,50)


In practice it appears that default behavior follows the Center strategy. Is it possible to modify a paint to produce results corresponding to one of the other strategies?

A:No you can't; the stroke is always centered. The only things you can control are:


stroke miter
stroke cap
stroke join
stroke width


You must manually account for the stroke width when defining your drawing paths.
