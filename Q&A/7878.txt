Q:I went through this, and as far as the process goes I did that.



But I when I installed the app from play store I am not able to sign in using the google sign in button.

I have used Firebase for google sign in. When I am clicking the sign in button the option to choose the account is coming but then it is not signing in or doing anything.

So where possibly am I going wrong?

A:When you upload an apk to the play store then play store creates a new SHA1 key called "App signing certificate". You get that SHA1 and save in your console or firebase account (as you need).

New SHA1 will be found at Released Management->App Sigining on your play console.
