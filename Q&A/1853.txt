Q:I have an android app which displays a white screen for 2 seconds on startup. My other apps don't do this, but this one does. I have also implemented a splashscreen with the hope that it would fix this. Should I increase my splash screen sleep time?
Thanks.

A:Just mention the transparent theme to the starting activity in the AndroidManifest.xml 
file. 

Like:

<activity
        android:name="first Activity Name"
        android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" >
 <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
        </intent-filter>
 </activity>


and extend that screen with Activity class in place of AppCompatActivity.

like :

public class SplashScreenActivity extends Activity{

  ----YOUR CODE GOES HERE----
}
