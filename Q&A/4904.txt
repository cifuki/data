Q:A simple question, relating to the default 'home' directory when an app writes to the internal memory. By default, any files created are placed by the OS (2.2) in:

/data/data/your.package/files


When reading in files, the same default is used, when keeping in proper context via openFileInput(), openFileOutput().  But if I need to check file existence, for instance, using the File class, I need to specify the whole path in the constructor.

I see there are Environment.getDataDirectory() (returns /data), Environment.getRootDirectory() (returns /system), etc, but nothing related to getting the app's 'home' directory.

It's not a huge deal, but I'd rather not hard-code the full path into my App for File to use (say the package name changes, say the path changes in a future OS release) if there is some way to reference the app's 'home' directory programmatically.

A:Of course, never fails.  Found the solution about a minute after posting the above question... solution for those that may have had the same issue:

ContextWrapper.getFilesDir()


Found here.
