Q:I'm just getting started with android programming, and want to see if there is a way to programmatically set the lock screen image. I've found various ways of setting the wallpaper in the API, but I can't seem to find the equivalent ways of setting the lock screen image.

I've seen various posts saying that customising the lock screen by adding widgets or bits of applications is not possible, but surely there must be a way to set the image programmatically?

Cheers,

Robin

A:There is no "lock screen image" in Android. There most certainly is no "lock screen image" concept that is the same between stock Android, HTC Sense, MOTOBLUR, etc. This simply is not part of the Android SDK.

The project that Mr. Rijk points to is a security violation that pretends to be a lock screen replacement.
