Q:I've tried different methods around the web but couldn't make it work. 

Cursor cursor = sqlite.myDataBase.rawQuery("SELECT StartDate, EndDate FROM Tracks Where Id="+'"'+trackId+'"',null);

SimpleDateFormat outputFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
Date startDate = outputFormat.parse(cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("StartDate")));
Date endDate = outputFormat.parse(cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("EndDate")));


In this way I get both dates in good format. Now I want to find the difference between EndDate and Startdate in seconds.

Any advice? Thank you.

A:You can turn a date object into a long (milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970), and then use TimeUnit to get the number of seconds:

long diffInMs = endDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime();

long diffInSec = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toSeconds(diffInMs);


Edit:
-Corrected the name of the variable diffInMs which was written diffInM(i)s in the second line.
