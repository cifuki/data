Q:I'm developing a website for mobile. It works on Firefox desktop. It works on iPhone, but when I press a buton on Android 2.x (and maybe lower).
my JavaScript code crashes or what else...

Can I get access to the logger or JavaScript console for those devices?

The better should be a kind of Firebug application.

A:One option is weinre. It provides DOM & Style editing along with the console. If you don't want to set it up yourself, there is an instance hosted at http://debug.phonegap.com

The other option is JSHybugger. It's certainly the most complete debugging environment available for android browser. It's a paid product, but probably worth it.
