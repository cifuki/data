Q:I added some Fragment into a TableLayout and I want to manage them from my container Activity, so I used this:

Fragment fragment = (Fragment) tableLayout.getChildAt(i);


but getChildAt(int) returns a View and a View could NOT cast to Fragment

A:I don't understand why people are down-voting your question. Fragments can be very confusing at times, especially for beginners. To understand your problem, you must learn what is a Fragment and how they are used.

To start with, a View is something that has existence on the screen. Examples include: TextView, EditText, Button, etc. They are placed inside XML "layouts". These layouts are shown using an Activity. 

Now, a Fragment is not a View. It does not have any existence on the screen at all. Instead, it's a class that simply manages a "layout" \xe2\x80\x94 kinda similar to an Activity. If you need the View returned by your Fragment's onCreateView(), you can directly use findViewById() within your Activity.

If you need a reference to your Fragment, there are two possible ways of doing this:

1) If you added the Fragment programmatically like this

getFragmentManager()
    .beginTransaction()
    .replace(R.id.fragment_container_viewgroup, myFragment, FRAGMENT_TAG)
    .commit();


You can use:

MyFragment myFragment = (MyFragment) getFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag(FRAGMENT_TAG);


2) If you added the Fragment inside an XML layout like this:

<fragment android:name="com.example.android.fragments.HeadlinesFragment"
    android:id="@+id/fragmentContainer"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />


You can use this: 

getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.fragmentContainer);


Basically, each Activity has a FragmentManager class that maintains all the active Fragments, and there are two ways of finding them: Using a unique TAG that you pass while showing a fragment, or passing the container view-ID where the fragment was added.
