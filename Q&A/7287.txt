Q:Currently I have a really simple code that validates EditText fields and when the user hits the button at the end it checks them. It will put errors in all the fields with this:

if (!emailmatcher.matches()) {
    email.setError("Invalid Email");  
}
if (!zipmatcher.matches()) {
    zipcode.setError("Invalid ZipCode");                     
}


My problem that is the keyboard will popup and will move the error bubble to a random place. I was hoping to not have a error bubbles with a message but keep the error icons in invalid EditText fields. I tried inputting setError(null) but that doesn't work. Any Ideas?

A:Your code perfect to show icon only. 

As EditText is show anything related to when it has focused. So just change your code to like that...

if (!emailmatcher.matches()) {
    email.requestFocus();
    email.setError("Invalid Email");  
}
if (!zipmatcher.matches()) {
    zipcode.requestFocus();
    zipcode.setError("Invalid ZipCode");                     
}
