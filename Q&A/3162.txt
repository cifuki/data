Q:In Android Studio, I can't figure out where to put images to be used inside the app. The drawable folder isn't broken down into drawable-hdpi, drawable-ldpi, etc. I saw another question asking this and the answer was to switch to Project view instead of Android view but drawable is only one folder there too. There is mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-ldpi, etc, but people are saying that's only for app icons. I'm confused.

A:If you don't see a drawable folder for the DPI that you need, you can create it yourself. There's nothing magical about it; it's just a folder which needs to have the correct name.
