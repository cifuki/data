Q:What is meant by "multiDexEnabled true" in Android gradle. Why do we use this? What is the effect if it is enabled?

A:Android application (APK) files contain executable bytecode files in
  the form of Dalvik Executable (DEX) files, which contain the compiled
  code used to run your app. The Dalvik Executable specification limits
  the total number of methods that can be referenced within a single DEX
  file to 65,536, including Android framework methods, library methods,
  and methods in your own code. Getting past this limit requires that
  you configure your app build process to generate more than one DEX
  file, known as a multidex configuration.
