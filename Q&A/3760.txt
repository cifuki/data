A:UPDATED:
Matt provided a great link on how to add emulators for all Samsung devices.

OLD:
To get the official Samsung Galaxy Tab emulator do the following:


Open the Android SDK and AVD Manager 
Click on Available packages 
Expand the Third party Add-ons. There you will see Samsung Electronics add-ons.
Once the add-on is installed create a new emulator.  Under Target you will see the new Samsung Tab settings, select that. 


That's it!
