Q:The latest Android Support Library introduced the DrawerLayout to implement the common UX pattern where you slide right or left to show a navigation menu.

What I'd love to have is a vertical DrawerLayout with the same API, that can be pulled down/up from the top/bottom of my layout.

Since 4.2 the old SlidingDrawer has been deprecated and I haven't heard about some new Widget that implements the same functionality.

Can the DrawerLayout be extended somehow to implement the vertical swipe UX pattern?
Does google provide some different widget to implement it?

Google Music for instance has something very similar to what I'm looking to implement to pull up the player.

A:We have recently implemented this in the Umano App and open sourced: https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel

Enjoy.
