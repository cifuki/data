Q:I have now switched to Android Studio and saving my projects in Git with Source Tree. Whenever I add or remove any library from my module, its .iml file also changes. It really doesn't matter if I commit the *.iml because they get auto-generated in others Android Studio. However, here
 it says you should store *.iml . My question is, do we really need to share our *.iml with others? If yes, why?

A:General best practice is to:


make projects as IDE-agnostic as possible,
do not commit generated files.


So the answer is: it's better to make such files ignored for VCS.
