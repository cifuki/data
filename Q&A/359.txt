Q:I installed the latest version of the SDK (r21) and ADT 21.0.0. I tried simple code, and it works well, but now I get a warning in LogCat that did not appear in the previous versions:


  Unexpected value from nativeGetEnabledTags: 0


I googled it, and I found Issue 39723: Emulator spams LogCat with "Unexpected value from nativeGetEnabledTags: 0" message.

What does it mean?

A:I just ran into this problem, too. As a workaround I'm filtering the LogCat output with the following expression on the by Log Message field of the filter: 

^(?!.*(nativeGetEnabledTags)).*$ 


Otherwise it is so spammed it's almost useless.

Following  Laksh suggestion, if you want to filter this always without having to always write it on the Search for messages field:


Goto your Logcat
In the Saved Filters part on the left, click on the Edit selected logcat filter (If Saved Filters is not visible then click on Display Saved Filters View in the Logcat)
There, in the by Log Message field, enter ^(?!.*(nativeGetEnabledTags)).*$.
