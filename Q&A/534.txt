Q:Not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I installed the Android SDK Manager, and am now trying to install a platform like the Android Dev website suggests. Once I clicked install I got an error stating that the Manager could not create a temp folder within the Android directory. So I created it. Now I'm getting this error:


  Downloading SDK Platform Android 2.3,
  API 9, revision 1 File not found:
  C:\\Program Files
  (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk-windows\\temp\\android-2.3_r01-linux.zip
  (Access is denied)


There is also a little message under the progress bar that says "Done. Nothing was installed."

I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate, in case that's of any use.

A:Try running Android Studio as an administrator, by right-clicking on the .exe and selecting "Run As Administrator".

Also, some anti-virus programs have been known to interfere with SDK Manager.
