Q:So I am new to Android development and Android Studio.

I used Android Studio to create an Android project, and each time I wanted to commit the code to GitHub, I switched over to the command line and committed/pushed the code from there. 

However, I realize now that Android Studio has it's own features for connecting to GitHub. I'd like to use those features. 

Since the project already exists, I prefer not to just create a new GitHub repository from Android Studio and delete the old one. I just want to connect the existing GitHub repository with the Android Studio project.

How can I sync these up?

A:I would view this thread if you want to create a new project.

How do you synchronise projects to GitHub with Android Studio?

If this doesn't help then I would just delete your current(local) project and import from github.

I would recommend staying with command line. It is great practice. View link below for more information.
