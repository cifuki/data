NB: I have read every available tutorial, followed at least 10 of them, read all the similar questions about 'phonegap' not recognized,, .etc. I have my 'Enabled' registry set to 1 as some solutions have suggested, re-installed 'phonegap' & 'cordova' through NPM install -g phonegap, and same for 'cordova', and I still can't get them to run.

I copied an old phonegap application that I made on another PC, and I can run it through just fine. Hope this would clear anything up.

A:You do not need to add any cordova folder to the path.

cordova command is a nodejs npm script, what you need is to have the npm folder in your path : 

%appdata%\
pm\\


or if it does not work, use instead 

c:\\users\\YourUserName\\AppData\\Roaming\
pm\\


(replace YourUserName with the name of your user profile)

What's strange is that I don't remember I had to change it manually, I think it should be added automatically when installing node and npm.
