Q:I want to get width and height (in pixels) of images which are stored on the sdcard, before loading them into RAM. I need to know the size, so I can downsample them accordingly when loading them. Without downsampling them I get an OutOfMemoryException.

Anyone knows how to get dimensions of image files?

A:Pass the option to just decode the bounds to the factory:

BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;

//Returns null, sizes are in the options variable
BitmapFactory.decodeFile("/sdcard/image.png", options);
int width = options.outWidth;
int height = options.outHeight;
//If you want, the MIME type will also be decoded (if possible)
String type = options.outMimeType;
