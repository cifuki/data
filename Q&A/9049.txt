Q:I have a webview that works fine on iOS, but not Android. Is there a tool where I can connect to Android webview in browser and debug it using firefox or webkit console? 
Currently I have no idea what is causing the webview not to work in Android.

In iOS I am able to open my iPad or iPhone simulator, open the webview pane, and in my desktop browser I listen to port 9999, and it shows me the tools you see in webkit developer tool/debugging tools.

I am looking for similar tool for Android, or at least to get me started on debugging.

A:Check out weinre. It provides Chrome developer-like tools for debugging from WebKit browsers to browsers running on remote devices.
