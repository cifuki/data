Q:Is it possible to pass a JavaScript object from JavaScript to Java using addJavascriptInterface()? Something along these lines:

var javaScriptObject = {"field1":"string1", "field2":"string2"};
JavaScriptInterface.passObject(javaScriptObject);


How would such a call be captured on the Java side? I have no problem setting up the interface to send a string, but when I send an object, I receive null on the Java end.

A:AFAIK, addJavascriptInterface() only works with primitive types and Strings, and so you cannot pass arbitrary Javascript objects.
