Q:I have recently created a library Jar file that I imported in my Android project. I am able to call functions and use classes that are present in this Jar file, but Android Studio keeps telling me that it cannot "resolve symbol" of the class I am using. Please see the screenshot below:

The code builds and executes successfully. The function isThisThingWorking() simply returns true, and that is just what boolean blah gets set to.

I have tried pressing the Sync Project with Gradle Files button and using the Invalidate Caches / Restart... option from Android Studio's File menu, but none of this solved the issue. What can I do to make the Android Studio IDE not display the Cannot resolve symbol 'xxxSDK' error?

A:I have faced this issue when IntelliJ IDEA got closed abruptly due to OS crash.

You can do "File" -> "Invalidate Caches...", and select "Invalidate and Restart" option to fix this.
