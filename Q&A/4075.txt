Q:May I know what is the difference between styles.xml and themes.xml? To me, they just look same as both XML are in the same format.

<style name="...
    <item name="...


So, in my app which provide customization coloring, size, drawable, ... do I need both styles.xml and themes.xml as well? How should I decide which XML to put in which file?

A:Out of the whole page of the Styles and Themes. You may be looking for this line.


  When you apply a style to a single View in the layout, the properties
  defined by the style are applied only to that View. If a style is
  applied to a ViewGroup, the child View elements will not inherit the
  style properties\xe2\x80\x94only the element to which you directly apply the
  style will apply its properties. However, you can apply a style so
  that it applies to all View elements\xe2\x80\x94by applying the style as a theme.


When you apply as theme, it changes everything in scope, depending if you applied it on Activity or Application. Style is more 'local'.
