Q:Is there is any way to include the Apache library directly in Gradle to make it work with Android 6.0 ?

I've tried to include the libraries like that:

compile 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:4.4.1'
compile 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5'


And Android Studio couldn't manage to find the following import:

import org.apache.http.auth.AuthenticationException;
import org.apache.http.auth.Credentials;
import org.apache.http.auth.MalformedChallengeException;
import org.apache.http.auth.UsernamePasswordCredentials;
import org.apache.http.impl.auth.DigestScheme;

A:This page discusses the removal of the Apache HTTP classes, and it suggests a workaround as well:


  To continue using the Apache HTTP APIs, you must first declare the following compile-time dependency in your build.gradle file:

   android {
       useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'
   }



In my case Android Studio still complained that it couldn't find these classes, but the app did build and run.

The page does recommend you move to HttpURLConnection, though.
