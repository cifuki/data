Q:AccountAuthenticator.java:

Intent intent = new Intent(context, AccountActivity.class);


AccountActivity.java:
In onCreate(Bundle aBundle) I want to say:

getIntent().getContext();


But getContext() does not exist.

How do I get the Context from the Intent ?
Since it's passed in the Intent constructor, I was expecting it to be available on arrival in the AccountActivity.

A:How do I get the Context from the
  Intent ?


You don't.


  Since it's passed in the Intent
  constructor, I was expecting it to be
  available on arrival in the
  AccountActivity.


The Context is only used to help create the Intent routing information. Since an Intent can (and frequently does) live outside of any Context, an Intent cannot hold onto a Context.


  I need the Service (i.e. Context) that
  created the Intent, so as to be able
  to create an AsyncTask taking it in
  the constructor.


You cannot do this, sorry.


  If I don't do that I get:
  "java.lang.SecurityException: caller
  uid 10027 is different than the
  authenticator's uid", since the
  AsyncTask is doing Accountmanager am =
  Accountmanager.get(context).


This has nothing to do with AsyncTask. This has to do with processes, not threads.
