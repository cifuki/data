Q:SimpleCursorAdapter deprecates one of its constructors with the following comment: 

Deprecated. This option is discouraged, as it results in Cursor queries being performed on the application's UI thread and thus can cause poor responsiveness or even Application Not Responding errors. As an alternative, use android.app.LoaderManager with a android.content.CursorLoader.

Does this make the whole class deprecated? The other (standard) constructor is not deprecated.

A:Only the constructor is deprecated, not the whole class. 

SimpleCursorAdapter (Context context, int layout, Cursor c, String[] from, int[] to) calls SimpleCursorAdapter (Context context, int layout, Cursor c, String[] from, int[] to, int flags) with flags set to FLAG_AUTO_REQUERY. 

But FLAG_AUTO_REQUERY is deprecated because 


  [...] it results in Cursor queries being performed on the application's UI
  thread [...]


so also the constructor is deprecated. 

The standard constructor is not deprecated but, obviously, you don't have to call it with flags = FLAG_AUTO_REQUERY! 

Finally, if you are using SimpleCursorAdapter with a CursorLoader, as the documentation suggests, 
this flag is not needed and you can pass 0.
