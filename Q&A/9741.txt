Q:My app is working fine but I am getting this warning every time when I test my app in my physical device. I am not using any such third party library which can cause this type of issue. My LogCat view.

E/BoostFramework: BoostFramework() : Exception_1 = java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.qualcomm.qti.Performance" on path: DexPathList[[],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/system/lib64, /vendor/lib64]]


Is this issue will cause some serious issue in future or not.
Thanks in Advance :)

A:This is nothing you can do about it. It is the system level log of your device's firmware, which was not removed by the device manufacturers.    

It won't hurt, and it is shown to you by the accident. Just don't pay any attention to it. It doesn't have to be resolved.
