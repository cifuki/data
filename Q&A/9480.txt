Q:I have an Android app using In-App-Purchase that caters to an international audience, so I expect payments in different currencies. Of course I would like to show the items for purchase with the user's local currency, but I don't really know how.

Using the region or language of a user seems like a bad indicator, as the currency seems to depend on the region of the Market account the user is using and not on the device settings.

How can I find out which currency a user will pay in?

Thanks.

A:As of IAB Version 3, the SKU details for the purchasable item include a formatted price, which includes the currency the user would pay in (the corresponding currency to their Google Play store):


Some examples of values of price (not from a real SKU):


3,99\xe2\x82\xac
\xc2\xa32.99
$4.99


EDIT: I've updated the SKU details table, now including information about the price_currency_code field.
