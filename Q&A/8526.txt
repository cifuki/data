Q:In my app I have some objects that have their location displayed on the map using markers.
The problem is that the only way I've found to handle marker clicks is

googleMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(new ... {
    @Override
    public void onMarkerClick(Marker marker) {
       // how to get the object associated to marker???
    }
})


In other words I get the Marker object while the only interface that I have allows me to set just MarkerOptions.

Any way to associate Marker with an object?

A:You can associate arbitrary object by using Marker's setTag() method 

Marker amarker = mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions().position(lat, lng).title("Hello World"));
amarker.setTag(new SomeData());


To retrieve data associated with marker, you simply read it using its getTag() and then cast it to its original type.

SomeData adata = (SomeData) amarker.getTag();
