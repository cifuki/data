Q:is it possible to add &nbsp; in TextView? Has anyone achieved similar functionality?

I want to have non-breakable space in TextView.

A:I haven't tried this to ensure that it actually does work, but in an ideal world TextView should respect the Unicode no-break space character (\\u00A0), which would be a simpler/lighter solution than HTML.
