Q:On iOS it is possible to choose when you want your app to be visible on the store after it has been validated by Apple. Is this possible with Android and the Google Play Store?

A:This is now possible using timed publishing.  It appears to be restricted to updates so it may not work for the initial launch unless the app is published to your alpha or beta channels first.
