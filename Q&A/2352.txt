Q:I'm following this tutorial: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#overview 
on how to add Google Maps to an app within the Android SDK. 

The only problem I seem to be having is during this bit (I've done everything else with no errors):

Edit your application's AndroidManifest.xml file, and add the following declaration within the

 <application> element. This embeds the version of Google Play services that the app was compiled with.

 <meta-data
 android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
 android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />

The error is:
   No resources found that match the given name (at 'value' with value '@integer/    
   google_play_services_version').


I've tried to follow this persons solution to the same problem: Google Play Services Library update and missing symbol @integer/google_play_services_version 

but I'm still getting the same error. Any help please?

A:It is probably that your library is not linked to project properly or that you have older google-play-services library version so conflict appears and Eclipse got stupid.. :S

No you don't need to add anything in integers.xml. When you link properly Google-play-services library to your project reference android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" will be found and you are ready to go. When you add library to your project just do one more clean so funny Eclipse environment sweep-out things properly.

If you hardcode somewhere this number when next play version come you would need to update it. And if you forget that, you will spend time again looking for bug.. :S 

Hope it helped. ;)
