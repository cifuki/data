Q:I want to turn off displaying "Suggested Words" on the soft/virtual keyboard when someone is using my application (only on certain Activities). For the default Android keyboard, this can be found under 'Settings' (under Word Suggestion Settings).

Is there a way to disable it only within your application, without requiring the user to manually go and do it? I basically want the user to type words without providing any hints.

Thanks!

A:When developing for 2.0+, the supposed way is setting android:inputType="textNoSuggestions" (ref).
Unfortunately, suggestions are still shown on HTC Desire 2.2 (and probably other HTC Sense devices as well).
Using android:inputType="textVisiblePassword"will not help as well as the software keyboard by HTC won't allow you to switch languages.
So I stick to android:inputType="textFilter" to disable suggestions.
