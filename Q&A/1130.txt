Q:How can I mock my location on a physical device (Nexus One)? I know you can do this with the emulator in the Emulator Control panel, but this doesn't work for a physical device.

A:It seems the only way to do is to use a mock location provider.

You have to enable mock locations in the development panel in your settings and add  

   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION" /> 


to your manifest.

Now you can go in your code and create your own mock location provider and set the location of this provider.
