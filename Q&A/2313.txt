Q:I have HTC Comet connected to Eclipse with SDK 2.2. I do a debug build - the application does not run; though it does get installed on the device. On the device I get this message box on the Comet screen

Waiting for Debugger
Application HunyDew (process com.airvine.hunydew) is waiting for the debugger to attach.
[Force Close]

Whereas in the Eclipse console I get these set of messages  

[2010-12-07 01:42:29 - hunydewprj] Android Launch!  
[2010-12-07 01:42:29 - hunydewprj] adb is running normally.

The application runs fine in the Emulator - please help - what is it that I am missing here? Any hints/suggestions? Thanks

A:Some devices will only let the debugger attach if the application has the android.permission.SET_DEBUG_APP permission set in its manifest file:

<manifest>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_DEBUG_APP"></uses-permission>
</manifest>
