Q:I am trying to run a Android Emulator by using AVD Manager.
this is my avd:

and this is what happens by starting:

I have a Macbook Pro Retina. Installed the Haxm driver direct from intel page.

No emulator is working. All get the same "error" message.

Running Command (This error was when i used Homebrew for installing Android-sdk and Android-platform-tools | anyone who get the same problem should remove this or look where the conflict is)

export ANDROID_EMULATOR_DEBUG=1 test20

After I fixed the problem with Homebrew:

I tried a bit around and found this:

emulator64-x86 -avd test20

emulator: ERROR: Could not load OpenGLES emulation library: dlopen(lib64OpenglRender.dylib, 1): image not found
emulator: WARNING: Could not initialize OpenglES emulation, using software renderer.
HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode
qemu: could not load PC BIOS 'bios.bin'


For all who has the same problem,  maybe these steps help: 

Run your Emulator in Debug mode: 

export ANDROID_EMULATOR_DEBUG=1 emulatorName


If there is a path that look strange check for other installations like Homebrew and remove the conflict (uninstall one)

When the library is missing you need to export the variable:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/lib


And when error "qemu: could not load PC BIOS 'bios.bin'" appears, one fix is to run the emulator with the full path: 

/Applications/Android\\ Studio.app/sdk/tools/emulator64-x86 -avd test20
In your case it is maybe a other path.

A:If you are using macOS, add both Android SDK emulator and tools directories to the path:

Step 1: In my case the order was important, first emulator and then tools.

export ANDROID_SDK=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK/emulator:$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$PATH


Step 2: Reload you .bash_profile Or .bashrc depending on OS

Step 3: Get list of emulators available:
$emulator -list-avds 

Step 4: Launch emulator from the command line and Replace avd with the name of your emulator $emulator @avd    

Don't forget to add the @ symbol.

This was tested with macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and Android Studio 3.1.2.
