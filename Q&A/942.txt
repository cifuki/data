Q:I have a vertical LinearLayout where one of the items is an ImageView loaded using Picasso. I need to rise the image's width to the full device width, and to display the center part of the image cropped by a fixed height (150dp). I currently have the following code:

Picasso.with(getActivity()) 
    .load(imageUrl) 
    .placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder) 
    .error(R.drawable.error) 
    .resize(screenWidth, imageHeight)
    .centerInside() 
    .into(imageView);


Which values should I put into screenWidth and imageHeight (=150dp)?

A:You are looking for:

.fit().centerCrop()


What these mean:


fit - wait until the ImageView has been measured and resize the image to exactly match its size.
centerCrop - scale the image honoring the aspect ratio until it fills the size. Crop either the top and bottom or left and right so it matches the size exactly.
