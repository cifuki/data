Q:I want to design an app which shows a list of Wi-Fi networks available and connect to whichever network is selected by the user.

I have implemented the part showing the scan results. Now I want to connect to a particular network selected by the user from the list of scan results.

How do I do this?

A:You need to create WifiConfiguration instance like this:

String networkSSID = "test";
String networkPass = "pass";

WifiConfiguration conf = new WifiConfiguration();
conf.SSID = "\\"" + networkSSID + "\\"";   // Please note the quotes. String should contain ssid in quotes


Then, for WEP network you need to do this:

conf.wepKeys[0] = "\\"" + networkPass + "\\""; 
conf.wepTxKeyIndex = 0;
conf.allowedKeyManagement.set(WifiConfiguration.KeyMgmt.NONE);
conf.allowedGroupCiphers.set(WifiConfiguration.GroupCipher.WEP40); 


For WPA network you need to add passphrase like this:

conf.preSharedKey = "\\""+ networkPass +"\\"";


For Open network you need to do this:

conf.allowedKeyManagement.set(WifiConfiguration.KeyMgmt.NONE);


Then, you need to add it to Android wifi manager settings:

WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager)context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE); 
wifiManager.addNetwork(conf);


And finally, you might need to enable it, so Android connects to it:

List<WifiConfiguration> list = wifiManager.getConfiguredNetworks();
for( WifiConfiguration i : list ) {
    if(i.SSID != null && i.SSID.equals("\\"" + networkSSID + "\\"")) {
         wifiManager.disconnect();
         wifiManager.enableNetwork(i.networkId, true);
         wifiManager.reconnect();               

         break;
    }           
 }


UPD: In case of WEP, if your password is in hex, you do not need to surround it with quotes.
