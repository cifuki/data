Q:I would like my app beep with a specific frequency and duration. In the windows equivalent of this app (written in c#) I used a c++ dll with the function

beep(frequency, duration); 


Is this the same in android? Or at least how can I put my c++ dll in the project?

I would prefer not to use pre-built mp3's or system sound because I would like to give the user the choice of the frequency and duration.

A:If you want to use your C++ code in the android app which is possible. You need to look at Android NDK which allows you to use execute C++ code with the help of JNI (Java Native Interface).
