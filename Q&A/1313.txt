Q:I was trying to look how my app looks in material design and I would like to use the new cards lib.
My Problem is, that it's giving me this error within my gradle file and I need to fix that.

Error:compileSdkVersion android-L requires compiling with JDK 7


I downloaded jdk-7u60-macosx-x64.dmgand installed it. java -versionin Terminal is showing me that 1.7 is installed:

java version "1.7.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_60-b19)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.60-b09, mixed mode)


well

ls -l `which java`


is giving me:

/usr/bin/java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java


.../current/... doesn't have a .../home. I found the .../home here:

/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home


And set the path to the "SDK location" Preferences in Android Studio under "JDK location". But it's not working -- it seems that it still can't find JDK 7.

I'm using Mac OSX 10.9.3 and Android Studio (Beta) 0.8.1.

A:Setting the directory to:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home
in JDK settings solved my issue. I had the same problem getting started up. Hope this helps!
