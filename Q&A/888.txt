Q:I'm running on Windows 7, and I've updated all the drivers as it says on the Android developer website regarding using hardware devices. However, Eclipse is still not recognising my Nexus 4 when I try to run the application. The Android device chooser pops up, but it doesn't show anything on the hardware section. I've turned debugging, third-party apps, and mock locations all on on my phone as well.

Is this because the phone is still new? Is there a way of making my Nexus work with Eclipse?

Nothing is showing up under ADB devices in the command prompt.

A:I had a similar sounding situation with my Nexus 4. For me it was an issue with the drivers Windows was installing automatically. I followed the instructions in [Q]Computer won't recognize phone? - Post #8. I had some slight differences on WindowsÂ 7.

For me I,


Uninstalled the driver from Device Manager
Let it automatically install the generic 'MTP device driver'
Right clicked on the new device and selected 'Update Driver'
Selected 'Have Disk' and pointed it to [android-sdk-dir]\\extras\\google
Watched an 'ADB' driver install.
Opened Eclipse to successfully run on my Nexus 4.


Good luck!
