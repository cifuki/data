A:To create and start a new thread, from inside an activity, you can say:

Thread t = new Thread(){
public void run(){
getApplicationContext().bindService(
        new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MyAndroidUpnpServiceImpl.class),
        serviceConnection,
        Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE
    );
}
};
t.start();


Also, cache the value returned by bindservice, if any, if you require it for later use.
