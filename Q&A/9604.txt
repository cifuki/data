Q:Code:

Intent launchIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);
launchIntent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME);
Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(launchIntent, "Complete Action using..");
activity.startActivity(chooser);


I don't see any way to tell which Intent (HOME category launcher) was selected. There is no Intent.addOnActionSetListener, and no chooser.addOnIntentChosenListener etc. 

So how can I tell which was selected? Do I have to write my own chooser for this?

A:On Android 5.1+, you can use the three-parameter edition of the createChooser() method, where the last parameter is an IntentSender that you can use to find out what was chosen.

Prior to Android 5.1, there is nothing in Android to let you know what the user chose.
