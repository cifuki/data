Q:I have seen many Android answers that suggest calling the garbage collector in some situations.

Is it a good practice to request the garbage collector in Android before doing a memory-hungry operation? If not, should I only call it if I get an OutOfMemory error?

Are there other things I should use before resorting to the garbage collector?

A:For versions prior to 3.0 honeycomb: Yes, do call System.gc().

I tried to create Bitmaps, but was always getting "VM out of memory error". But, when I called System.gc() first, it was OK.

When creating bitmaps, Android often fails with out of memory errors, and does not try to garbage collect first. Hence, call System.gc(), and you have enough memory to create Bitmaps. 

If creating Objects, I think System.gc will be called automatically if needed,
but not for creating bitmaps. It just fails.

So I recommend manually calling System.gc() before creating bitmaps.
