Q:I upgraded IntelliJ Idea 12.0.4 to 12.10. 

Now all the modules in my Android project give the error: 

Error: Default Activity Not Found

I reverted to 12.0.4 and it works.

Any ideas ?? I think it might be related to some plugins not being installed cause the only other thing could have been a local config but I deleted the configuration folder to confirm and that didn't change anything.

A:If you see that error occur after upgrading versions of IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, or after Generating a new APK, you may need to refresh the IDE's cache.

File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart...
