Q:I've a couple of question I haven't been able to figure out.

I'm trying to get all the checked elements from a ListView but:


If I check and then uncheck an element, it's returned as "checked" by the getCheckedItemPositions() function
I don't know how can I iterate through this: 

SparseBooleanArray checked = list.getCheckedItemPositions();

A:The other answers using SparseBooleanArray are nearly correct, but they are missing one important thing: SparseBooleanArray.size() will sometimes only return the count of true values. A correct implementation that iterates over all the items of the list is:

SparseBooleanArray checked = list.getCheckedItemPositions();

for (int i = 0; i < list.getAdapter().getCount(); i++) {
    if (checked.get(i)) {
        // Do something
    }
}
