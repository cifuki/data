Q:Inside an OnClickListener I cannot access most variables "outside" of the scope, like this:

findViewById(R.id.Button01).setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener()
        {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v)
            {
                Intent mainApps = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);
                mainApps.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER);
                List<ActivityInfo> activities = this.getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities(mainApps, 0);
                /*
                Intent intent = new Intent("com.sygic.drive/com.sygic/drive/.SygicDriveActivity");
                startActivity(intent);*/
            }

        });


in this example I need to get the PacketManager, and I cannot get it since I do not have the Context available inside the OnClickListener. 

I could make a static reference outside, and use it inside, but is that correct? Seems odd to have to do that all the time?

A:Replace this in your code with MyActivity.this where MyActivity is the class name of your Activity subclass.

Explanation: You are creating an anonymous inner class when you use this part of your code: new OnClickListener() { Anonymous inner classes have a reference to the instance of the class they are created in. It looks like you are creating it inside an Activity subclass because findViewById is an Activity method. Activity's are a Context, so all you need to do is use the reference to it that you have automatically.
