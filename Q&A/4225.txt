Q:I am trying to load an image from the asset folder and then set it to an ImageView. I know it's much better if I use the R.id.* for this, but the premise is I don't know the id of the image. Basically, I'm trying to dynamically load the image via its filename. 

For example, I randomly retrieve an element in the database representing let's say a 'cow', now what my application would do is to display an image of a 'cow' via the ImageView. This is also true for all element in the database. (The assumption is, for every element there is an equivalent image)

thanks in advance.

EDIT

forgot the question, how do I load the image from the asset folder?

A:If you know the filename in the code, calling this won't be a problem:

ImageView iw= (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imageView1);  
int resID = getResources().getIdentifier(drawableName, "drawable",  getPackageName());
iw.setImageResource(resID);


Your filename will be the same name as drawableName so you won't have to deal with assets.
