Q:I keep getting the following error:



I have reinstalled, deleted and tried about EVERYTHING to get Genymotion to work again.

I do not have the device I need, but Genymotion was PERFECT for the job, until Mavericks update I have been fighting to get it to work again. 

MacBook Pro, Retina 13-inch, Early 2013.
i5, 8gb.

I'm running version 1.3.1 for os x.
I do have Virtualbox 4.3 installed with Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.0-89960.vbox-extpack too.

My Virtualbox starts up normally without ANY errors.
I tried Environment variables putting vbox on my $PATH, all sorts of things.
Nothing works! 

I have no idea what to do anymore, anyone out there had similar problems and fixed it ?

EDIT:

EDIT 2:

VBoxManage list hostonlyifs

Prints the following:

A:I had the same problem and solved it by running the following command:

sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart
