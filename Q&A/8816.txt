Q:I am having difficulties trying to remove the back/home button from the action bar.

 getActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(false);   //disable back button
 getActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(false);


In a older android phone, the back button is removed with these two code lines. However with the nexus 4, the back button still appears but is just disabled. Also I am just adding a menu item on the right that behaves like the back/home button replacing the back/home button. What am I missing?

A:Use  getActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(false) to remove the home button from the action bar.
