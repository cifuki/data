Q:Im automating a testing procedure for wifi calling and I was wondering is there a way to turn off/on wifi via adb?

I would either like to disable/enable wifi or kill wifi calling (com.movial.wificall) and restart it. 

Is it possible to do this all via adb and shell commands?   

so far I have found:

android.net.wifi.WifiManager
setWifiEnabled(true/false)


Im just not sure how to put it together

A:Using "svc" through ADB (rooted required):

Enable:

adb shell su -c 'svc wifi enable'


Disable:

adb shell su -c 'svc wifi disable'


Using Key Events through ADB:

adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n com.android.settings/.wifi.WifiSettings
adb shell input keyevent 20 & adb shell input keyevent 23


The first line launch "wifi.WifiSettings" activity which open the WiFi Settings page. The second line simulate key presses.

I tested those two lines on a Droid X. But Key Events above probably need to edit in other devices because of different Settings layout.

More info about "keyevents" here.
