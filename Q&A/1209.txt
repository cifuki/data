I am creating a textview and adding to the layout dynamically. I am using textView.setTextSize(18) method to set the text size.I tested it on samsung tablet and found that the font size is too small for this screen then I changed the textsize to 25 but it is too big for an emulator(480*800). My problem is to set text size dynamically so that it fits for all the screens.

A:You should use the resource folders such as

values-ldpi
values-mdpi
values-hdpi


And write the text size in 'dimensions.xml' file for each range.

And in the java code you can set the text size with

textView.setTextSize(getResources().getDimension(R.dimen.textsize));


Sample dimensions.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <dimen name="textsize">15sp</dimen>
</resources>
