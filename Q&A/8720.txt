Q:I am going to install first application in my android phone, but having some doubts
related to Android Memory (Maximum size of APK).

So please help me know and solve the problems:


What is maximum size of the apk that can be supported by the android ?
When we install any apk file in real phone, where does application installed (in SD-card or other memory) ??


I have referred this link: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/7965885da4d1a03a and also searched lot.

I came Across the search on the web that many people are facing the same issue What is the maximum size of Application supported by Android. I think this question also help to the people who are connected with Android application programming and development.

Update:

This time i am having 58Mb application from that 52.5MB Images and it runs on the my HTC Hero mobile but On Emulator, it shows an error:

Failed to upload my_application.apk on device 'emulator-5554'
java.io.IOException: Unable to upload file: No space left on device
Launch canceled!


Now please suggest me the way to store images inside the Drawable folder? is there any way to zip the images or such method?

A:Its probably device specific as devices has a different amount of memory available for application. ref http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/18cbb2404778618e?pli=1
Its application dependant. The developer may state that the app should be preferrebly install on internal memory, the SD-card, or to let the user choose from SD-card and memory. This is only supported on Android 2.2. On older version of android, version <= 2.1, the app will be installed into the memory. Its defined inside the AndoridMainfest.xml via the android:installLocation element. It supports the values internalOnly, preferExternal or auto. But again, only supported on Android 2.2. ref https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2.html


I tested on my HTC Desire with more than 500 MB of memory. With almost none apps installed I can install an apk that is 43MB, but an apk that is 57MB is too large, even i got plenty of available memory... it fails with 

Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE]

The "File Manager" application tells me that im using 60/147MB (40%). The limit seems be 147 MB, but in practice, as i have tested, this is not true...

Update:

I did some testing, and published the results here:
