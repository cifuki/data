Q:I found some answers to that issue but none worked for me. When getting the last screen in a new project creation, I'm getting the next message:


  Unsupported template dependency: Upgrade your Android Eclipse plugin


The required version is empty (in some cases appears as 8). The installed version is 18.

I already tried many of the solutions I found here, like:


Run the SDK manager as administrator
Run Eclipse as administrator
Re-install the support components from the SDK extra folder and then restart Eclipse,


None of these didn't work for me.

Is there another solution?

A:Update 2: Now (2013-09-19T17:00:00Z) there's an ADT 22.2.1 and Tools 22.2.1 updates available that fix this issue:


  
  Use Eclipse > Help > Check for Updates to get ADT 22.2.1
  Use SDK Manager to get Tools 22.2.1
  
  
  You need both parts to fix the issue. The ADT bundle and the installer package on http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html have been updated too.


(From here)



Update: The bug report now has a response with fixed template files attached and the following comments:


  This one is my bad. I was in the middle of changing the dependency system used by the templates and a transient state got picked up into this tools build. The templates have settled in the AOSP master branch.
  
  I've attached a snapshot of the current Activities templates. Replacing your sdk/tools/templates/activities folder with the contents of this zip should resolve this issue.
  
  I apologize for the inconvenience.


My older workaround below.



Workaround to the bug:

For Blank Activity:


Edit <sdk>/tools/templates/activities/BlankActivity/template.xml
Comment out the dependency:

<!--<dependency name="appcompat" version="v7" />-->



For Master/Detail Flow:


Edit <sdk>/tools/templates/activities/MasterDetailFlow/template.xml
Comment out the dependencies:

<!--<dependency name="support" version="v4" />
<dependency name="android-support-v4" revision="8" />-->



Finally:


Restart Eclipse


If needed, copy android-support-v4.jar from <sdk>/extras/support/v4 to your libs.
