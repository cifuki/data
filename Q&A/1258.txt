Q:I am currently migrating an Eclipse app to Android Studio.
This app was using the in app billing.

My main problem is to compile the project and the aidl file (I guess you all use this file)

I get this error message: 

Gradle: error: cannot find symbol class IInAppBillingService
Gradle: error: package IInAppBillingService does not exist


So, following some tutorials, I move this file from com.mypackage.billing to src/main/aidl
(see this reference)

But as soon, as I do that, I get this message:


  Gradle: Execution failed for task ':xxxxxxxxxxx:compileDebugAidl'.
  
  
    Failed to run command:
            (...)     C:\\Users\\xxxx\\AndroidStudioProjects\\xxxxxxProject\\xxxxxxx\\src\\main\\aidl\\IInAppBillingService.aidl:45
    interface IInAppBillingService should be declared in a file called
    com\\xxxxxxxx\\billing\\IInAppBillingService.aidl.
  


The message is clearly a contradiction with the post from the Google bug page I linked above.

Anyone suceeded to make this aidl file to work and can help me?



Just to inform, some links I followed:

A:Just as the error message says, you need to put IInAppBillingService.aidl in the correct directory dictated by it's package (com.android.vending.billing).

Within the src/main/aidl/ folder you already have, put the .aidl file in com/android/vending/billing/.
