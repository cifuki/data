From the post Is it possible to start activity through adb shell?, we can start an Android app via adb by

adb shell am start -n yourpackagename/.activityname


But is it possible to start an Android app via adb without knowing the Activity name? For example, by sending the android.intent.action.MAIN intent to a package? Maybe some command like this:

adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n packageName


Thanks!!

A:Yes, it is possible to launch an app via adb shell making use of the monkey tool.

Using the command from this answer:

adb shell monkey -p app.package.name -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1


This command simulates the app icon click, so the intent implicit intent LAUNCHER is delivered to the specific receiver declared in app manifest (MAIN)
