Q:I recently discovered that the Android 2.0 SDK supports multitouch through new functions in the MotionEvent class. You can specify a pointer index when retrieving touch properties, and in cases where multiple fingers are on the screen there should be multiple pointers provided.

Unfortunately, I only have a G1 to test on and it's running Android 1.5 and not 2.0.

Is there any way to test multitouch without a 2.0 device? In the iPhone simulator, you can hold down option and shift option to perform two fingered pinch and two fingered drag, respectively. Is there any similar functionality in the Android emulator? Is it something I should expect to see in the future, or should I just suck it up and buy a new test phone?

A:This is a post by a guy from the Android team who says that multitouch in the emulator is still not supported.
