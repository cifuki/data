Q:I created my own WebView and set the WebChromeClient and WebViewClient objects. When I start this WebView, the HTML form fields react when I touch them (a cursor appears), but they do not get selected, nor does the soft keyboard start. If I use the trackball to choose the form and press it, the keyboard does appear.

I tried to call myWebview.requestFocusFromTouch() as this answer suggested, but it returns false and doesn't help.

Here is a fix in case other were not clear. 

webview.requestFocus(View.FOCUS_DOWN);
    webview.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
        @Override
        public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
            switch (event.getAction()) {
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP:
                    if (!v.hasFocus()) {
                        v.requestFocus();
                    }
                    break;
            }
            return false;
        }
    });
