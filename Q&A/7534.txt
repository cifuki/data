Q:I am having a problem capturing an image and storing it from the native camera app.  Here is a sample of some of my code.

_path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "make_machine_example.jpg";
File file = new File( _path );
Uri outputFileUri = Uri.fromFile( file );

Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE );
intent.putExtra( MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, outputFileUri );

startActivityForResult( intent, 0 );


After the picture has been taken and I'm returned back to my original Activity, When I navigate to my sd card via Android DDMS File Explorer the picture is not there.  Anyone know why this is not being saved?

A:Have you checked what the output of Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() is, because if it does not contain a trailing file seperator (/) then your image will end up in a directory that does not reside on the SDcard such as:

 /mnt/sdcardmake_machine_example.jpg


When what you really want is:

 /mnt/sdcard/make_machine_example.jpg


Try this code instead:

 _path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + File.separator +  "make_machine_example.jpg";
