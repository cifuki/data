Q:I want to use the new Multidex support library to break the method limit for one of my apps. 

With Android Lollipop Google introduced a multidex support library that makes it easy to multidex. 

What steps are needed to use this library and to build my app with multidex support?

A:Edit:

Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher uses ART which natively supports multidexing. Therefore, if your minSdkVersion is 21 or higher, the multidex support library is not needed.



Modify your build.gradle:

android {
    compileSdkVersion 22
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.0"

         defaultConfig {
             minSdkVersion 14 //lower than 14 doesn't support multidex
             targetSdkVersion 22

             // Enabling multidex support.
             multiDexEnabled true
         }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'
}


If you are running unit tests, you will want to include this in your Application class:

public class YouApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base);
        MultiDex.install(this);
    }

}


Or just make your application class extend MultiDexApplication

public class Application extends MultiDexApplication {

}


For more info, this is a good guide.
