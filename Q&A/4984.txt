Q:I am new in developing native app using Salesforce SDK. I tried to create android project from command line using forcedroid tool but there is problem in setting environment variable named ANDROID_HOME.

But i don't know how to set this variable.

I am attaching screenshot to describe my problem correctly.

A:Open the terminal and type : 

export ANDROID_HOME=/Applications/ADT/sdk


Add this to the PATH environment variable

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/bin


If the terminal doesn't locate the added path(s) from the .bash_profile, please run this command

source ~/.bash_profile

Hope it works to you!
