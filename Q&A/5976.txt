Q:I have a EditText which I am presenting as disabled so that user cannot edit the contents and also to avoid popping-up keyboard. But now I want to capture onclick event in the EditText and  identify the individual words that are being clicked.
Any help is most welcome.

Thanks,
Balkrishna.

A:On your EditText set attributes android:focusable="false" and android:enabled="true".
And set OnClickListener to that EditText. The click on that Edittext triggers the onClick() method but it can't be edited. I just tried it.
