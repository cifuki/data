Q:I'm programmatically creating a TextView that I want to ellipsis at the end.

pseudo code:

    tv.setEllipsize(TextUtils.TruncateAt.END);
    tv.setHorizontallyScrolling(false);
    tv.setSingleLine();


The above works GREAT.

    tv.setEllipsize(TextUtils.TruncateAt.END);
    tv.setHorizontallyScrolling(false);
    tv.setMaxLines(1);


This does not work. Is this a bug? I don't understand why I can't get text to ellipses at the end when specifying maxLines especially a maxLine of 1 but setSingleLine is ok.

A:setSingleLine() or setSingleLine(true) prevents the TextView from changing its height to more lines and forces the TextView to ignore line breaks (the symbol \
 in a string).

setMaxLines(int n) displays the first n lines of the String displayed in the TextView which are separated by a line break.

For example let the String be "my first line \
 and my second line \
 and a third one"


setSingleLine() lets the TextView display "my first line and my.." since the display width is exceeded and
setMaxLines(1) results in "my first line"
setMaxLines(2) results in "my first line" and below a line saying "and my second line"
setMaxLines(3) obviously does not have any effect on this sample string.


Update: This should work for "setDoubleLine with truncation":

// optional: string.replace("\
",""); or string.replace("\
"," ");
tv.setSingleLine(false);
tv.setEllipsize(TextUtils.TruncateAt.END);
int n = 2; // the exact number of lines you want to display
tv.setLines(n);
