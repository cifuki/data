Q:Whenever I try to import my Eclipse project to Android Studio I get the following error :


  You are using an old, unsupported version of Gradle. Please use
  version 1.8 or greater. Please point to a supported Gradle version in
  the project's Gradle settings or in the project's Gradle wrapper (if
  applicable.)

Im using Android Studio 0.3 and Ubuntu, I also tried it on a Windows 8 box with fresh install but getting the same error. I'm using default gradle wrapper and I tried checking and unchecking auto import option. Is this a bug? How can I get around it. How do I update gradle to 1.8 or check the current gradle version?

A:I had to edit the gradle wrapper settings in gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties and change gradle version to 1.9.

./gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties :

#Wed Apr 10 15:27:10 PDT 2013
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=http\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.9-all.zip


I had to change gradle-1.6-bin.zip to gradle-1.9-all.zip. I guess the old ADT plugin from eclipse which generates this file still uses the old URL.

Then I had to create a local.properties in project root and set correct SDK dir in it. 

./local.properties

sdk.dir=/home/user/pathtosdk


Did that and imported using default gradle wrapper and voila! The project imported without any problem.

Notes: This also fixes the issue with org.gradle.tooling.GradleConnectionException: Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip';.: Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip'; You must also make sure that in the file ./build.gradle, com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.5.+ should be changed to com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.7.+.

If you are still experiencing problems with import, open up the project root in command line   and run ./gradlew or gradlew.bat according to your os. You'll be getting errors with more debug info and maybe tips on how to solve them.
