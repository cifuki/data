Q:I set an Android:process=":XX" for my particular activity to make it run in a separate process.
However when the new activity/process init, it will call my Application:onCreate() which contains some application level initialization.

I'm thinking of avoiding duplication initialization by checking current process name.

So is there an API available?

Thanks.

A:If I've understood your question correctly, you should be able to use ActivityManager, as per this thread.
