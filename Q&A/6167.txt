Q:I downloaded Genymotion Android emulators for Oracle VirtualBox (http://www.genymotion.com/) on my Windows 7 PC, created a virtual Jelly Bean with Google Apps device. How do I enable ADB access to it? In system settings/Developer options I already enabled "USB debugging", but typing "adb devices" shows empty list of connected devices. Tried adding a USB port for this VM and rebooting VM, but it does not help.

A:We need to connect with IP address to the emulator, so look for the IP address of the running emulator (it's shown in the emulator title bar) and use something like:


  adb connect 192.168.56.102:5555


Afterward adb works normally. You may also find out the IP address of a running emulator by starting "Genymotion Shell" and typing 'devices list'

I also find out that occasionally I have to do the above when the emulator is running for a longer time and somehow ADB disconnects from it.
