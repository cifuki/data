Q:I want to test Https calls from android device using Charles proxy tool. I need to see the raw request/response contents for debugging app. I've configured Charles by adding the host and port under "Proxy Settings" -> SSL Tab. When I run the app, all SSL calls seems to disappear quickly from the Charles. Does any one has any idea how to fix this issue. Charles documentation doesn't seem to have information for Android devices.

for the Android version below Android7

From your computer, run Charles:


Open Proxy Settings: Proxy -> Proxy Settings, Proxies Tab, check "Enable transparent HTTP proxying", and remember "Port" in heart. 

SSL Proxy Settings:Proxy -> SSL Proxy Settings, SSL Proxying tab, Check \xe2\x80\x9cenable SSL Proxying\xe2\x80\x9d, and add . to Locations:


Open Access Control Settings: Proxy -> Access Control Settings. Add your local subnet to authorize machines on you local network to use the proxy from another machine/mobile.



In Android Phone:


Configure your mobile:  Go to Settings -> Wireless & networks -> WiFi -> Connect or modify your network, fill in the computer IP address and Port(8888):

Get Charles SSL Certificate. Visit this url from your mobile browser:
http://charlesproxy.com/getssl

In \xe2\x80\x9cName the certificate\xe2\x80\x9d enter whatever you want
Accept the security warning and install the certificate. If you install it successful, then you probably see sth like that:
In your phone, Settings -> Security -> Trusted credentials:



Done.

then you can have some test on your mobile, the encrypted https request will be shown in Charles:
