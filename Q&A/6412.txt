Q:I have created an application with android studio, never change a single word in any file. 

when trying to run it on the emulator I got the following error:

W/EGL_emulation\xef\xb9\x95 eglSurfaceAttrib not implemented
W/OpenGLRenderer\xef\xb9\x95 Failed to set EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR on surface 0xa6c1ace0,error=EGL_SUCCESS
I/Choreographer\xef\xb9\x95 Skipped 45 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
W/EGL_emulation\xef\xb9\x95 eglSurfaceAttrib not implemented
W/OpenGLRenderer\xef\xb9\x95 Failed to set EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR on surface 0xa6c1ace0, error=EGL_SUCCESS


I am not getting the same problem when I run it on a real device:

W/IInputConnectionWrapper\xef\xb9\x95 getExtractedText on inactive InputConnection
W/IInputConnectionWrapper\xef\xb9\x95 getTextBeforeCursor on inactive InputConnection
W/IInputConnectionWrapper\xef\xb9\x95 getSelectedText on inactive InputConnection
W/IInputConnectionWrapper\xef\xb9\x95 getTextAfterCursor on inactive InputConnection
W/art\xef\xb9\x95 Before Android 4.1, method int android.support.v7.internal.widget.ListViewCompat.lookForSelectablePosition(int, boolean) would have incorrectly overridden the package-private method in android.widget.ListView

A:I've found the same thing, but only on emulators that have the Use Host GPU setting ticked. Try turning that off, you'll no longer see those warnings (and the emulator will run horribly, horribly slowly..)

In my experience those warnings are harmless. Notice that the "error" is EGL_SUCCESS, which would seem to indicate no error at all!
