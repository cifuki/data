Q:I use LogCat to look at the debug output of my apps. 
If other apps are running or the system has of the test device has some noisy background threads running LogCat will scroll all the time and I have to correct my position manually to read long stack traces. 

Is there a way to disable the scrolling in LogCat? Or somehow tweak the scrolling settings?

A:One way is to create a filter for all the noisy services.

Just create a filter with the tag of the disturbing logs. Logcat will not filter those messages out of the main logview and slow down the scrolling. 

This is not the best solution. It will lead to a LogCat with 15 or 20 different filters only used to remove not used log output.

UPDATE Additionally to using filters one of the last updates of the android tools added a pause button to logcat. Just click the button and autoscroll is disabled.
