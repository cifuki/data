Q:In many new android applications and their latest update those applications(mostly material design) have a custom scrollbar with letters and numbers, while scrolling the scrollbar with thumb, alphabets or numbers appear beside thumb.I have attached screenshot to the question of the scrollbar from the application 'Contacts'.

Screenshot:


So, How to modify a scrollbar in my application which is using recyclerview, to create scrollbar like that scrollbar with the alphabet and number bubble or is there any new API or library introduced for that?

A:For anyone still looking for an answer for this. I have found a number of libraries which provide this functionality:


https://github.com/krimin-killr21/MaterialScrollBar
https://github.com/plusCubed/recycler-fast-scroll
https://github.com/danoz73/RecyclerViewFastScroller
https://github.com/timusus/RecyclerView-FastScroll


All of the above provide FastScroll mechanism (what you're looking for) - though some look nicer than others.

I have found the MaterialScrollBar easiest to get set with up and use, as well as the fact that it has the nicest cosmetics (adheres to material design guidelines and looks just like Contacts app). 

This library is also actively maintained and developed, issues & PR's being closed etc.

Hope this may help someone as I spent a lot of time looking for this myself.
