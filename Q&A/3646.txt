Q:I always see a crossed out line setOnTabSelectedListener for the following code 

viewPager.setAdapter(adapter);
viewPager.addOnPageChangeListener(new TabLayout.TabLayoutOnPageChangeListener(tabLayout));
tabLayout.setOnTabSelectedListener(new TabLayout.OnTabSelectedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onTabSelected(TabLayout.Tab tab) {
        viewPager.setCurrentItem(tab.getPosition());
    }
}


And the error shown is:


  setOnTabSelectedListener is deprecated


However, the program seems to work just fine. May I know what's going on?

Deprecated means that they decided this is not a good way to do it or they have found a better way of doing it, and this deprecated method will be removed in the future.

The fix is to use addOnTabSelectedListener instead of setOnTabSelectedListener.
It works almost the same way.

The difference is that with addOnTabSelectedListener:


you can add multiple listeners. With setOnTabSelectedListener you could only have one.
you should remove the listener when you're done with it, with removeOnTabSelectedListener.




General rule of thumb: never use deprecated methods.
