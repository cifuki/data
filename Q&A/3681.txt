Q:Is there XML attribute that does the exact opposite of android:dependency? 

What I would like the dependent preference to be enabled when the other is NOT checked and disabled when it IS checked.

edit: maybe the issue isn't with android:dependency maybe there is an xml attribute that I can add to make the default for that preference disabled and then android:dependency will toggle it the opposite way like i want.

edit again:
I tried setting android:enabled="false" in the preference and it disables it like i want but even with it being dependent on the other preference it didn't enable it like i had hoped

A:Actually found it on my own and figured I'd just post it here to help anyone that might have this same issue:

android:disableDependentsState="true"


Put that in the controlling preference.
