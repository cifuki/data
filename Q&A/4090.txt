Q:I want to check to see if a user has rated my app on the Google Play, not how many stars, just if they have. And if they haven't I will prompt them with a dialog asking them to rate it with this code:

startActivity( new Intent( Intent.ACTION_VIEW,
       Uri.parse("market://details?id=packagename") ) );

A:No. You cannot do this. And this is a good thing too -- otherwise you will be able to influence rating by giving people who rated it rewards and such. Additionally, developers would be able to retaliate to negative reviews if such an API were available. This might also violate certain legal agreements between the User and Google if Google starts revealing this data.

However, this is what I personally do in my apps:


Let the user use the app 5 times, to get a good feel of it.
Prompt the user on the sixth run to rate it with options for Yes, Later and Never. Later delays it by two days.
