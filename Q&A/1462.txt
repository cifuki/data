Q:I spent the last two days trying to figure out how to debug an HTML5 app I created using Cordova 3.2 and deployed to an Android 2.3 device. All the articles/posts I've seen provide hacks rather than real solutions :( and most of the time, none of them works for my case; debug the css styles and the Angularjs code inside my app..

So far I tested;

debug.phonegap.com

I injected the script to the index.html file then visited the generated URL in debug.phonegap.com but nothing happens; only a blank page.

Weinre

Most of the articles I found point to obsolete Github repository that countain a Jar file.. but it's not found :(

Edge inspect

It works and shows the webpage I'm browsing on the PC inside the mobile.. But the problem is that it uses some other integrated browser (or emulator) than the one that runs phonegap apps; so the results are not accurate.

Chrome emulator

Same as Edge inspect; it doesn't allow to view real web-kit v530 that is shipped with Android 2.3.

The dream solution

The perfect solution would be an extension to Google Chrome (desktop) that enables you to switch the desktop browser to the same one found in Android 2.3 platforms; no emulation no hacks, just the browser itself with web-kit v 530.

Unfortunately such solution doesn't exist :( or I'm wrong?

Any suggestions?

A:FOR ANDROID:

You only need to enable \xe2\x80\x9cUSB remote debugger\xe2\x80\x9d within your android device and plug with a USB cable. Then open your application in the device. Chrome will detect the remote browser and you can see the console in the same way than you see it when you use Chrome locally.

Use this link: chrome://inspect/#devices in Chrome browser (you'll have to paste it into the nav bar).

If your app crashes in the device you only need to see the console\xe2\x80\x99s log within your browser and see what happens. You also can add functionality, change variables, and override functions in the same way than we do it with our local browser.

Read this article for more information on the steps to take.

This will work ONLY with devices running Android 4.4+.

FOR iOS:

Use Safari for iOS, follow these steps:

1.In your iOS device go to Settings > Safari > Advanced > Web Inspector to enable Web Inspector

2.Open Safari on your iOS device.

3.Connect it to your computer via USB.

4.Open Safari on your computer.

5.In Safari\xe2\x80\x99s menu, go to Develop and, look for your device\xe2\x80\x99s name.

6.Select the tab you want to debug.
