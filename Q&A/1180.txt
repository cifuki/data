I've created a PreferenceActivity that allows the user to choose the theme he wants to apply to the entire application.

When the user selects a theme, this code is executed:

if (...) {
    getApplication().setTheme(R.style.BlackTheme);
} else {
    getApplication().setTheme(R.style.LightTheme);
}


But, even though I've checked with the debugger that the code is being executed, I can't see any change in the user interface.

Themes are defined in res/values/styles.xml, and Eclipse does not show any error.

<resources>
    <style name="LightTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Light">
    </style>

    <style name="BlackTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Black">
    </style>    
</resources>


Any idea about what could be happening and how to fix it?
Should I call setTheme at any special point in the code? My application consists of several Activities if that helps.

A:I would like to see the method too, where you set once for all your activities. But as far I know you have to set in each activity before showing any views.

For reference check this:

Edit (copied from that forum):

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Call setTheme before creation of any(!) View.
     setTheme(android.R.style.Theme_Dark);

    // ...
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
}
