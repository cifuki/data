Q:I am using RecyclerView inside NestedScrollView and it works. But when I use RecyclerView inside LinearLayout or something, it scroll in various speed depending on gesture. The scroll listen to gesture and if I slide up only a bit, then it scroll a little bit while if I slide up really fast, then it scroll really fast. Now my problem is that RecyclerView inside NestedScrollView certainly scroll but fast scroll does not work. However I slide up fast or slow, RecyclerView or NestedScrollView only scroll a little bit. 

How can I make my NestedScrollView or RecyclerView inside that scroll view scroll in various speed?
