Q:I just downloaded Eclipse Galileo and installed ADT10 and tried to a phonegap app using this guide: http://www.phonegap.com/start
But each time i try to build im getting this error:
Unknown error: Unable to build: the file dx.jar was not loaded from the SDK folder!

I know that there are already some questions/answers about it in this forum but they didnt work for me.

A:This is caused by incomplete/messy upgrade to latest version which results in dx.jar missing from {Android SDK dir}\\platform-tools\\lib\\.

Solution:

Find your latest dx.jar in {Android SDK dir}\\platforms\\* 

and copy it to:

{Android SDK dir}\\platform-tools\\lib\\

Restart eclipse, clean your project and everything should work as expected.

(If platform-tools\\lib directory is missing entirely you will have to reinstall "Android SDK platform-tools" using SDK manager. After reinstall dx.jar should be in there so no copying will be needed)

If you can't find dx.jar in any of {Android SDK dir}\\platforms\\* subdirs you will have to start SDK manager and install Android 1.6 SDK.

For example on my machine latest was in {Android SDK dir}\\platforms\\android-4\\tools\\lib\\.
(I did not find any newer version as of 2012-01-22 Android SDK R15).

I really hope that this is useful for someone  because I've wasted half a day investigating and looking for solution of such a trivial bug... :-(
