Q:I am new to Android Development. I was just following the basic turorial on developer.android.com to create my first application.

As I was creating the Action BAr, I had to add this Search button to it. I created the menu xml and this is what I had written on it.

<!-- Search, should appear as action button -->
<item android:id="@+id/action_search"
      android:icon="@drawable/ic_action_search"
      android:title="@string/action_search"
      android:showAsAction="ifRoom" />
<!-- Settings, should always be in the overflow -->
<item android:id="@+id/action_settings"
      android:title="@string/action_settings"
      android:showAsAction="never" />


Now my question is on this part of the XML

android:icon="@drawable/ic_action_search"


I get a compilation error in eclipse, which says,


  error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'icon' with value '@drawable/ic_action_search').


I checked on developer.android.com and also googled it out, but I'm just not able to locate a solution.

I need to solve this problem. As always, I am able to skip this part of the XML and what I get is just plain text "SEARCH", but the icon will definitely look better.

A:You need an image called ic_action_search.png or ic_action_search.gif, for example. Paste this image in every res/drawable folder.
