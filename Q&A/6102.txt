A:There is no Power Button in Emulator like Devices have,So

To stop an emulator instance, just close the emulator's window.

And To Start/Restart it Start from AVD Manager of Eclipse and Your BroadcastReceiver with BOOT_COMPLETE action will get called for sure

You can start AVD another way also, From CMD go to Tools of AndroidSDK and give this commmand E:\\android-sdk-windows\\tools>emulator -avd AVDNAMEHERE

To Send Broadcast from CMD you can use this Command.


  adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED -c
  android.intent.category.HOME -n package_name/class_name
