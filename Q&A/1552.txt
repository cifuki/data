Q:I can easily do it when I am using onCreateOptionsMenu or onOptionsItemSelected methods.

But I have a button somewhere in screen, and on clicking that button, it should enable/disable context menu items.

A:Anyway, the documentation covers all the things.

Changing menu items at runtime


  Once the activity is created, the
  onCreateOptionsMenu() method is called
  only once, as described above. The
  system keeps and re-uses the Menu you
  define in this method until your
  activity is destroyed. If you want to
  change the Options Menu any time after
  it's first created, you must override
  the onPrepareOptionsMenu() method.
  This passes you the Menu object as it
  currently exists. This is useful if
  you'd like to remove, add, disable, or
  enable menu items depending on the
  current state of your application.


E.g. 

@Override
public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenu (Menu menu) {
    if (isFinalized) {
        menu.getItem(1).setEnabled(false);
        // You can also use something like:
        // menu.findItem(R.id.example_foobar).setEnabled(false);
    }
    return true;
}


On Android 3.0 and higher, the options menu is considered to always be open when menu items are presented in the action bar. When an event occurs and you want to perform a menu update, you must call invalidateOptionsMenu() to request that the system call onPrepareOptionsMenu().
