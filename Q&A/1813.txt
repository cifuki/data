Q:If I have the following code:

Intent intent = new Intent(this,DownloadService.class);     
for(int i=0;i<filesArray.length;i++){        
     startService(intent);          
}


In this code DownloadService extends IntentService.

So now when I'm calling startService(intent) does that mean that I'm starting a new service every time startService(intent) is called or does that mean that DownloadService is run once and then each time I call startService(intent) it will just pass a different intent with a different startId.

Does this make sense, and which one of these is the case ?

A:The Service will only run in one instance. However, everytime you start the service, the onStartCommand() method is called.

This is documented here
