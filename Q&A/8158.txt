Q:I've spent the past two hours debugging what seems extremely unlikely.  I've stripped the method of a secondary Android Activity to exactly this:

public void onClick(View v) {
        String str = "25";
        long my_long = Long.getLong(str);
} // onClick (v)


And yeah, I get a crash with the good ol' NullPointerException:

09-11 02:02:50.444: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(1588): Uncaught handler: thread main exiting due to uncaught exception
09-11 02:02:50.464: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(1588): java.lang.NullPointerException

It looks like (from other tests) that Long.getLong(str) returns NULL, which is driving me bonkers.  WHAT AM I MISSING?

Thanks in advance.  I'm okay with stupidly missing the obvious, but my sanity is on the line.

A:You are missing the fact that Long.getLong(String str) is not supposed to parse a String to a long, but rather to return a long value of a system property represented by that string. As others have suggested, what you actually need is Long.parseLong(String str).
