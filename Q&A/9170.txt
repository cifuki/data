Q:I  have problems to finish the activity before. I want to start another activity and finish the current activity. When I used finish it didn't exit the current activity. 

How can I exit the activity before?

A:You need to intent your current context to another activity first with startActivity. After that you can finish your current activity from where you redirect.

 Intent intent = new Intent(this, FirstActivity.class);// New activity
 intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
 startActivity(intent);
 finish(); // Call once you redirect to another activity


intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP) - Clears the activity stack. If you don't want to clear the activity stack. PLease don't use that flag then.
