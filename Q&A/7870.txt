Q:I would like to convert/adapt my application to Android 4.0.
To do so I plan to use the ActionBar on devices that support it. 
All Android version >= 3.0 do so. Furthermore devices that do not have a hardware menu button seem to show an "menu" button on the actionbar automatically. 

When I test my application on the emulator using API level 13 this does work as expected...
... but somehow I'm not able to setup the emulator to behave the same way while emulating a phone on API level 14 (Android 4.0). 
When I try to set "Hardware Back/Home keys" to false there are no buttons at all (not on the screen and not keypad provided by the emulator).

I have seen on some screenshots and videos from the "Galaxy Nexus" that it is showing an "menu" button on the ActionBar as well ... like Honeycomb tablets do it, but I'm somehow not successful to do the same with the emulator which makes it a bit more complicated to understand how my UI will work on Andoid 4.0 phones.

EDIT:
Here is an image that is showing the On-Screen back and home buttons I would like to see in the emulator:

A:It seems the issue was fixed with the latest update of the SDK (R16).
Just update your SDK and ADT to R16 and create a new emulator using the updated Android 4.0 system image.
