Q:Eclipse is giving me an error on the android:configChanges line in my AndroidManifest.xml:

<activity android:name="com.google.ads.AdActivity"
              android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize"></activity>


the error is:

error: Error: String types not allowed (at 'configChanges' with value 'keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize').


If I leave only keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation there's no error, but compiler asks for the 4 remaining ones when I try and build.

I'm using GoogleAdMobAdsSDK-4.3.1.

Any ideas?

EDIT: I got it working by changing my project.properties (default.properties on SDK's lower then 14) file to:

# Project target.
target=android-14


and in my SDK Manager having the SDK Platform Android 4.0 - Revision 14 installed.

It should also work for SDK Platform android 3.2 - revision 13, so you just have to change the project.properties target to android-13 if that is the case. Basically you just have to make sure that the SDK revision is 13 or above, and that you have that SDK installed in the SDK manager and the project target in default/project.properties pointing to it.

A:Simple answer: the mentioned config changes are not support in Android 2.1, have a look here:

http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#config

e.g. uiMode needs API Level 8.

From the official AdMob Documentation:

Requirements

The Google AdMob Ads SDK for Android requires Android 1.5 or later. Make sure you have the latest copy of the Android SDK and that you're compiling against at least Android v3.2 (set target in default.properties to android-13).

have a look here: https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start

So I think your tools version is not updated to at least Version 13.
