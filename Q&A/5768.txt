Q:I have an ImageButton which is disabled (non clickable or set as disabled). I want to give an UI feel to the user that it is disabled without using any other image.

Is there any way to do this?

A:Unlike a regular Button, an ImageButton or a Button that has an image background is not grayed when disabled. You actually have to use another image or to process it in a way it appears grayed.

Should using another image be ok, you can do this by using a <selector> (here associated to a regular Button but this amongs to the same):


/drawable/my_selector.xml: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:state_enabled="false"
        android:drawable="@drawable/button_gray" /> ***button_gray is a Drawable image***
    <item android:state_pressed="true"
        android:drawable="@drawable/button_gray" /> 
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/button_red" /> ***button_red is a Drawable image*** 
</selector>



Please note that in a selector the logic applies a sequential way, item per item. Here, button_red is used all the time but when the button is disabled or being pushed. 


Your layout.xml:

<Button android:id="@+id/myButton"
        android:background="@drawable/my_selector" ***this is a reference to the selector above ***
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
/>



And should using another image be a problem, other answers (such as @Tronman's or @southerton's) give you ways to programmatically process the image in a way it appears grayed.
