Q:One of my apps has an "opening screen" (basically a menu) that has an EditText followed by several Buttons. The problem is that several of my users are reporting that when they open the app it's automatically popping up the on-screen keyboard without them even touching the EditText. As far as I can tell, all of these users are using the HTC Hero. 

Is this a bug in 1.5? Is there anything I can do about it?

A:You can use the following line of code in the activity's onCreate method to make sure the keyboard only pops up when a user clicks into an EditText

this.getWindow().setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN);
