Q:I have created an Android emulator (Android Virtual Device), but I am unable to find out the SD card I have built during creation of this.

How can I find the SD card and its content and also how to install APK files to the AVD?

A:switch to DDMS perspective
select the emulator in devices list, whose sdcard you want to explore.
open File Explorer tab on right hand side.
expand tree structure. mnt/sdcard/


refer to image below



To install apk manually:
copy your apk to to sdk/platform-tools folder and run following command in the same folder

adb install apklocation.apk
