Q:I have Xamarin Studio, and I need to specify the Android SDK Location. I have previously had Xamarin Studio working on my pc, and for some reason, I need to enter this again.

I have entered the following location:

C:\\Users\\**username**\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\android-sdk

Xamarin Studio does not accept this location and displays the following message:

No SDK found at the specified location


This location has platform-tools and other SDK folders.

Why is this not working, and what should I do?
