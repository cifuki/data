A:Translate - Basically do what it says. Just translate the canvas using x,y. If you want to draw two objects and the one is just translation of the other e.g x2 = x1 + 50 for each point . You don't have to make all your calculations again for the second object but you can just translate the canvas and draw again the same object. I hope this example will help you.
