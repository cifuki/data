Q:I'm running Ubuntu 17.10, and I've just updated Android Studio from version 3.0.1 to 3.1. Here's the version information in Help -> About:

Android Studio 3.1
Build #AI-173.4670197, built on March 22, 2018
JRE: 1.8.0_152-release-1024-b01 amd64
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o
Linux 4.13.0-37-generic


Unfortunately, while the IDE was able to resolve android-specific references before in my (first ever) Kotlin project, in the new version it appears unable to. Here's a screenshot showing what I mean:



In Android Studio 3.1, it's claiming that core Android functions such as setContentView() don't exist, and keeps prompting me to create an abstract function for it - which I clearly don't want to do. However, if I hit the build button, I get a BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 8s.

Does anyone know why my editor is doing this, and how I get get Android-related functions and classes to resolve correctly again?

Edit: Update: I've got more information on the issue now, but it's still not resolved:


Build -> Clean and then Build -> Rebuild doesn't help.
File -> Invalidate Caches and Restart doesn't help either
Neither does a manual Gradle sync.
A different project that's written in Java instead of Kotlin works fine.
Link to the project I'm experiencing issues with (it's open-source)

A:Exit Studio.
Delete .idea/ (seems to me that's most important), build/, app/build directories.
Start Studio
Set Settings -> Build -> Gradle settings back (last stable Gradle local distribution in my case).
Clean&rebuild project.


Helps me.
