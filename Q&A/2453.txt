Q:Google maps API is great for developing location based services for mobile phones. But for some reason, the use of it is restricted for me in a special project.

E.g. if your project is in conflict with the general terms and conditions of google it is not recommended to use google maps API.

In my app, both Android and iOS, I want to display a location on a map by retrieving GPS information. Overall the API should offer a similar scope of operation like google maps API.

Which alternatives do you know? Maybe there are open source API's? Any other suggestions?
