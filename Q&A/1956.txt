Q:I'm implementing some code to do my own referral tracking on downloads from the Android market.

See Android referral tracking does not work for an idea of what my app is doing.

How can I test if this code is working before deploying to the public?

A:The easiest way is using adb. You don't have to write any code.

Just run in a terminal:

adb shell 
am broadcast -a com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER -n <your.package>/.<path.up.until.your.BroadcastReceiver> --es "referrer" "utm_source=test_source\\&utm_medium=test_medium\\&utm_term=test_term\\&utm_content=test_content\\&utm_campaign=test_name"


Here's my exact line:

am broadcast -a com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER -n net.lp.collectionista/.util.broadcast_receivers.FacadeBroadcastReceiver --es "referrer" "utm_source=test_source\\&utm_medium=test_medium\\&utm_term=test_term\\&utm_content=test_content\\&utm_campaign=test_name"


But your BroadcastReceiver may need to be the AnalyticsReceiver, i.e. 

For Google Analytics v2:


  com.your.package/com.google.analytics.tracking.android.CampaignTrackingReceiver


For Google Analytics v3:


  com.your.package/com.google.android.apps.analytics.AnalyticsReceiver


For Google Analytics v4:


  com.your.package/com.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingReceiver


As Luigi said, you can also leave out the "-n" componentname part, but then every app on your device will receive the referral. This can be a good extra test to see if your BroadcastReceiver can be found properly.

The output I see (especially the last line is important):

05-13 17:28:08.335: D/Collectionista FacadeBroadcastReceiver(8525): Receiver called
05-13 17:28:08.335: V/Collectionista FacadeBroadcastReceiver(8525): Receiver called with action: com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER
05-13 17:28:08.365: D/GoogleAnalyticsTracker(8525): Stored referrer:utmcsr=test_source|utmccn=test_name|utmcmd=test_medium|utmctr=test_term|utmcct=test_content
