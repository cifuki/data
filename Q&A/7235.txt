Q:I am working on video player application, I want to play .mp4 video in native videoview. I am not able to play video using url. I am getting error Sorry this video cannot be played and also I am not able to play downloaded video in native videoview.

My code for playing video in videoview:

String mUrl = "http://www.servername.com/projects/projectname/videos/1361439400.mp4";

VideoView mVideoView  = (VideoView)findViewById(R.id.videoview)
videoMediaController = new MediaController(this);
mVideoView.setVideoPath(mUrl);
videoMediaController.setMediaPlayer(mVideoView);
mVideoView.setMediaController(videoMediaController);
mVideoView.requestFocus();
mVideoView.start();


Kindly share your ideas for the same. 

Thanks.

A:MP4 is just a container - the video and audio stream inside it will both be encoded in different formats.

Android natively only supports certain types of formats. This is the list here.

Make sure the video and audio encoding type is supported. Just because it says "mp4" doesn't automatically mean it should be playable.
