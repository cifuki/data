Q:Using adb shell to clear application data

adb shell pm clear com.android.browser


But when executing that command from application 

String deleteCmd = "pm clear com.android.browser";      
        Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
        try {
            runtime.exec(deleteCmd);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();                
        }


Issue:

It doesn't clear the user data neither gives any exception though I have given the following permission. 

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CLEAR_APP_USER_DATA"/>


Question:

How to clear the application data using adb shell?

A:Afaik the Browser application data is NOT clearable for other apps, since it is store in private_mode. So executing this command could probalby only work on rooted devices. Otherwise you should try another approach.
