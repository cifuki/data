Q:I am thinking of creating a core application library (a library project with all the logic), a free version)and a full version  that use this library.

As I understand some things in the manifest do not merge down like permissions and activities, does the version code merge?  Could I put a single version code in the library to apply to both the free and paid versions?

The second question is, my current application (The one I will turn into an Android library) depends on a library, therefore if I make it a library, as I understand it, you cannot have a library inherit from a library.  How do I get around this?

A:THIS ANSWER WAS CORRECT FOR EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE ANDROID SDK BUT IS NOW OBSOLETE.
SEE Hayes's ANSWER BELOW FOR MORE UP-TO-DATE INFO.


The manifest file for a library project is almost totally not used.  The only part that's necessary is the manifest element with a package attribute.  I believe the rest of the manifest for a library project is ignored.
The android tools released in Sept 2010 do support a library project referencing a library project.  The docs state otherwise, but I'm pretty sure they are out-of-date.
