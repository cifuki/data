A:For this problem you should:


Check whether the flashlight is
available or not?
If so then Turn Off/On
If not then you can do whatever, according to your app
needs.


For Checking availability of flash in the device: 

You can use the following:

 context.getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_CAMERA_FLASH);


which will return true if a flash is available, false if not.

See:http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html for more information.

For turning on/off flashlight:

I googled out and got this about android.permission.FLASHLIGHT. Android manifests' permission looks promising:

 <!-- Allows access to the flashlight -->
 <permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"
             android:permissionGroup="android.permission-group.HARDWARE_CONTROLS"
             android:protectionLevel="normal"
             android:label="@string/permlab_flashlight"
             android:description="@string/permdesc_flashlight" />


Then make use of Camera and set Camera.Parameters. The main parameter used here is FLASH_MODE_TORCH. 

eg.

Code Snippet to turn on camera flashlight. 

Camera cam = Camera.open();     
Parameters p = cam.getParameters();
p.setFlashMode(Parameters.FLASH_MODE_TORCH);
cam.setParameters(p);
cam.startPreview();


Code snippet to turn off camera led light. 

  cam.stopPreview();
  cam.release();


I just found a project that uses this permission. Check quick-settings' src code. here http://code.google.com/p/quick-settings/ (Note: This link is now broken)

For Flashlight directly look  http://code.google.com/p/quick-settings/source/browse/trunk/quick-settings/#quick-settings/src/com/bwx/bequick/flashlight (Note: This link is now broken)

You could also try to add a SurfaceView as described in this answer LED flashlight on Galaxy Nexus controllable by what API?
This seems to be a solution that works on many phones.

Update 3 (Widget for turning on/off camera led)

If you want to develop a widget that turns on/off your camera led, then you must refer my answer  Widget for turning on/off camera flashlight in android..

Update 4

If you want to set the intensity of light emerging from camera LED you can refer Can I change the LED intensity of an Android device? full post. Note that only rooted HTC devices support this feature.

** Issues:**

There are also some problems while turning On/Off flashlight. eg. for the devices not having FLASH_MODE_TORCH or even if it has, then flashlight does not turn ON etc.

Typically Samsung creates a lot of problems.
