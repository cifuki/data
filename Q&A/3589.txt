All I want to do is grab the stuff in alphabetical order and ignore the capital letters.

db.rawQuery("SELECT " + catName + " FROM "+tableName+" ORDER BY "+catName+" ASC COLLATE NOCASE;", null);


This is the code I'm using above, but it always gives me an SQLite exception saying that COLLATE is a syntax error.


  android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: near "COLLATE": syntax error: , while compiling: SELECT Artist FROM testTable COLLATE NOCASE ASC

A:COLLATE goes before the order direction:

db.rawQuery("SELECT " + catName 
           + " FROM " +tableName 
        +" ORDER BY "+catName+" COLLATE NOCASE ASC;", null);


But you don't need the ASC -- that's the default so you could just as well use:

db.rawQuery("SELECT "+ catName 
            +" FROM "+ tableName 
        +" ORDER BY "+ catName +" COLLATE NOCASE;", null);
