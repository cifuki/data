Q:I have an Android app and it supports sending text via other apps. It therefore uses the ACTION_SEND intent and the EXTRA_TEXT field. The chooser presents me with all apps that can handle such an intent. Those are Twitter, EMail, ... and Facebook. But when I select Facebook it opens the browser and goes to the following page:

http://m.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=mytext

It shows my text and the submit button. But when I press the submit button nothing happends. The page just loads again.
I think maybe it is only possible to send URLs via the Facebook App. Could that be?

Did anyone manage to send text via ACTION_SEND through the Facebook Android app?

A:EDITED: with the new release of the official Facebook app for Android (July 14 2011) IT WORKS!!!

OLD: The examples above do not work if the user chooses the Facebook app for sharing, but they do work if the user chooses the Seesmic app to post to Facebook. I guess Seesmic have a better implementation of the Facebook API than Facebook!
