A:Intent - is a message passing mechanism between components of Android, except for Content Provider. You can use Intent to start any
  component.
  
  Sticky Intent - Sticks with Android, for future broadcast listeners. For example if BATTERY_LOW event occurs then that Intent
  will stick with Android so that any future requests for
  BATTERY_LOW, will return the Intent.
  
  Pending Intent - If you want some one to perform any Intent operation at future point of time on behalf of you, then we will use
  Pending Intent.
