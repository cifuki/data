Q:Android Studio 0.3.6
Fedora 18 3.11.7-100.fc18.x86_64
Nexus 5 Kitkat


Hello,

I have been using my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 running Android 4.1.2 everything works fine with adb.

However, I have just bought a new Nexus 5 device, and when I do the following command adb devices it doesn't show my Nexus 5.

Under Android SDK Manager | Extras | Google USB Driver | status "Not compatiable with Linux"

Because I am running Fedora 18 if I need drivers what drivers for the USB do I need?

Because the Samsung works fine and I can deploy and run my apps, I think my setup is correct. So I am wondering if there is something wrong with my Nexus 5.

I have tried the following:

adb kill-server
adb start-server


Setting the Nexus 5 Camera PTP and media device MTP didn't work.

Many thanks for any suggestions,

A:I had a similar problem with my Nexus 4(Android version 4.4.2), it wasn't listed in adb devices.

Make sure USB debugging is enabled from device, and do the following on your PC:


Update Android SDK (Google USB Driver)
From PC Control Panel, System -> Device manager -> Right click Nexus 4 -> Update driver.
Set android-sdk-folder\\extras\\google\\usb_driver as path to search, include subfolders checked.


If windows tells you that the driver is up to date, just uninstall the driver (right click on nexu4 -> uninstall driver) and start from step 2 again.

After that, open a cmd and type adb kill-server and then a adb devices, now it will include your device.
