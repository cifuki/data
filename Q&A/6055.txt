Q:When loading a widget if it cannot find a resource or something it says Problem Loading Widget. That's all! Amazing! This message remains on the home screen and does not even say which widget it had trouble loading. 

I figured it out by trial and error but I would like to know if there are any places to find the error message when this occurs. Where will Android say what problem it had loading the widget or even which widget it failed to load?

A:As said in comments, check logcat.  What you will see is a NullPointerException.  I have had this before too.
