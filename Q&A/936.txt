I am new to Android development.
I know if you change a android phone from portrait to landscape sometimes the app relays its self out on the screen.. so how do I simulate rotating a phone with the emulator? 
On the Blackberry emulators there's a button in the menu to turn the phone, but I can't find it or any option on the Android ones?  

What am I missing?

A:See the Android documentation on controlling the emulator; it's Ctrl + F11 / Ctrl + F12.
