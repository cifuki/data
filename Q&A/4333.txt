Q:I've got users with tablets that have a tab key on their soft keyboard.  I am using a table view and have 3 EditText Fields in one row with EditText fields below the current row.

When the user hits tab it takes them to the next field below, not the next field to the right.

Is there a way in the layout to set the tab order or is it only done programatically?

If it can only be done in Java, how exactly is it done?

Thanks for the tip on NextFocusRight but it didn' seem to work (or I did something wrong)

Here is the code I used.  I have to add the imeoptions to get the "next" button to show up in my emulator.  Do you see anything wrong with the way I did this? 

    <EditText 
android:id="@+id/bikeHHT"
android:layout_width="50dip"
android:layout_height="40dip"
android:textSize="14px"
android:maxLength="2"
android:nextFocusLeft="@+id/bikeMMT"
android:imeOptions="actionNext"
android:layout_column="1"/>
<EditText 
android:id="@+id/bikeMMT"
android:layout_width="50dip"
android:layout_height="40dip"
android:textSize="14px"
android:nextFocusRight="@+id/bikeSST"
android:imeOptions="actionNext"
android:maxLength="2"/>

A:Replace android:nextFocusLeft by android:nextFocusDown. The "next" soft button or the TAB key is looking for the next "down" focus and not left or right.
