Q:I'm writing a client that is making repeated http requests for xml data that is changing over time.  It looks like the Android stack is caching my page requests and returning the same page repeatedly.  How do I make sure it gets a fresh page each time?

-- code ---

HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpGet request = new HttpGet(url);
HttpResponse response;
    response = client.execute(request);

InputStream in;
in = response.getEntity().getContent();
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));


Thanks,
Gerry

A:add a HTTP header:

Cache-Control: no-cache


and see if that works.
