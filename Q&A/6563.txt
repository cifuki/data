Q:I can delete apps (that I code myself and install through the SDK) using the command  

adb uninstall com.company.apppackage  


how do I uninstall this through the command line using adb if I do not know the package name? For example, if an app shows up in the Android main menu as My Application, how can I delete it if I do not know it's package name? Or alternatively, is there a way to somehow know an apps internal package name?

A:try:

adb root


Then enter adb shell

adb shell 


Find out your apps package name:

pm list packages | grep "your app name/something related to your app name"


Then use:

adb uninstall 


OR

pm uninstall
