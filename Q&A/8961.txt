Q:Using the new FirebaseMessaging it's easy to un/subscribe to topics via:

FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().subscribeToTopic();
FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().unsubscribeFromTopic();


But is there any way to get all topics the current installation is subscribed to ?

A:I have searched Android API, asked questions for the same on SO but din't find anything. There is nothing in Android API to get all topics of a specific token. 

However, you can do it through a GET request

HTTP GET Request

https://iid.googleapis.com/iid/info/<TOKEN>?details=true
Content-Type:application/json
Authorization:key=AAA....i1nM:APA9.....81gTPXCE55....JLPEG0wZobG_ile8lI35JTzHYE5MC..BmDD_Cxj5OxB1Yh....Rs5lo3UwLNL9h-WcocGV....b5bYWNI55kzNsrHK-7GljUDtMn 


TOKEN in url : FirebaseInstanceId.getInstance().getToken();

key : can be found in firebase console: Your project -> settings -> Project settings -> Cloud messaging -> Server Key

Note: Be careful when finding key, dont use web api key its different.
