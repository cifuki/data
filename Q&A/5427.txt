Q:I want to pass two values to another activity can I do this with putExtra or do I have to do it a more complicated way, which it seems from my reading. E.g.. can something like this work?

public final static String ID_EXTRA="com.fnesse.beachguide._ID";

Intent i = new Intent(this, CoastList.class);
i.putExtra(ID_EXTRA, "1", "111");
startActivity(i);


The above gives an error.

Edit

The first thing I tried was similar to:

i.putExtra(ID_EXTRA1, "1");
i.putExtra(ID_EXTRA2, "111");


but ID_EXTRA2 seems to write over ID_EXTRA1

So,

i.putExtra(ID_EXTRA, new String[] { "1", "111"});


Looks like the go but how do I extract the values from the array in the second activity, I have been using this for a single value.

passedVar = getIntent().getStringExtra(CoastList.ID_EXTRA);


I guess I have to turn ID_EXTRA into an array somehow???

A:You could pass a 'bundle' of extras rather than individual extras if you like, for example:-

Intent intent = new Intent(this, MyActivity.class);
Bundle extras = new Bundle();
extras.putString("EXTRA_USERNAME","my_username");
extras.putString("EXTRA_PASSWORD","my_password");
intent.putExtras(extras);
startActivity(intent);


Then in your Activity that your triggering, you can reference these like so:-

Intent intent = getIntent();
Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
String username_string = extras.getString("EXTRA_USERNAME");
String password_string = extras.getString("EXTRA_PASSWORD");


Or (if you prefer):-

Bundle extras = getIntent().getExtras();
String username_string = extras.getString("EXTRA_USERNAME");
String password_string = extras.getString("EXTRA_PASSWORD");


Hope this helps! :-)
