Q:Well, I have searched a lot. People say that I need to close the window of emulator to close it. However, I need to reboot the emulator to catch ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED by my BroadcastReceiver.

How can I do that?

A:You can use the following command from adb: 

adb shell am activity/service/broadcast -a ACTION -c CATEGORY -n NAME


for example:

adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED -c android.intent.category.HOME -n package_name/class_name


Note that class name and package names need to be as defined in the Manifest.

This will generate the Intent you want , directed only to the component you want (otherwise you system will go crazy with BOOT_COMPLETED sent...)
