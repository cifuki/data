Q:I have installed Android SDK and Eclipse on my\xc2\xa0Mac system. I am able to program using Eclipse and have created few sample applications. But I am still not able to access adb through the terminal window. I have tried following command in terminal:           

$ pwd
/Users/espireinfolabs/Desktop/soft/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools

$ ls
NOTICE.txt  dexdump     llvm-rs-cc-2
aapt        dx          llvm-rs-cc.txt
adb         lib         source.properties
aidl        llvm-rs-cc

$ adb --help
-bash: adb: command not found


I have also added the ls output so that you know in which window I am.

A:adb is not in your PATH. This is where the shell looks for executables. You can check your current PATH with echo $PATH.

Bash will first try to look for a binary called adb in your Path, and not in the current directory. Therefore, if you are currently in the platform-tools directory, just call

./adb --help


The dot is your current directory, and this tells Bash to use adb from there.

Otherwise, you should add platform-tools to your PATH, by adding the path in  your shell profile, depending on which file is used:


Linux: typically ~/.bashrc
OS X / macOS:  typically ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile


Add the following line there and replace the path with the one where you installed platform-tools:

export PATH=/Users/espireinfolabs/Desktop/soft/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools:$PATH


Save the profile file, then, re-start the Terminal or run source ~/.bashrc (or whatever you just modified).

If you've installed the platform tools somewhere else, change the path accordingly. For Android Studio on OS X, for example, you'd use the following\xe2\x80\x94note the double-quotes that prevent a possible space from breaking the path syntax:

export PATH="/Users/myuser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools":$PATH
