Q:The WebView control on android, does it support SSL?

I am trying to load a web page that uses a trusted ssl certificate but the WebView is just white.

Any suggestions?

A:Not an expert, just what i could find on the web.
from what I understand, the WebView does indeed support ssl, however, the blank screen is an indication that the WebView does not believe that the certificate is valid. This may happen with a certificate that is self-signed or a from a root auth that is not set up in android (perfectly valid cert does not validate). In any case, if you are using froyo or better you can try something like:

import android.webkit.WebView;
import android.webkit.WebViewClient;
import android.webkit.SslErrorHandler;
import android.net.http.SslError;

...

engine = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.my_webview);
engine.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {

    @Override
    public void onReceivedSslError (WebView view, SslErrorHandler handler, SslError error) {
        handler.proceed();
    }
});
