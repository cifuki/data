Q:For my Ubuntu machine, I downloaded the latest version of Android SDK from this page.

After extracting the downloaded .tgz file, I was trying to search for installation instructions and found:


  To get started on Linux:
  
  Unpack the .zip file you've downloaded. The SDK files are download separately to a user-specified directory.
  
  Make a note of the name and location of the SDK directory on your system\xe2\x80\x94you will need to refer to the SDK directory later when using the SDK tools from the command line.


What exactly are we supposed to do?

A:Option 1:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-sdk


The location of Android SDK in Mac can be any of the following:


/home/AccountName/Android/Sdk
/usr/lib/android-sdk
/Library/Android/sdk/ 
/Users/[USER]/Library/Android/sdk


Option 2:


Download the Android Studio.
Extract downloaded .zip file. 

The extracted folder name will read somewhat like android-studio


To keep navigation easy, move this folder to Home directory.


After moving, copy the moved folder by right clicking it. This action will place folder's location to clipboard.
Use  Ctrl    Alt   T  to open a terminal
Go to this folder's directory using cd /home/(USER NAME)/android-studio/bin/ 
Type this command to make studio.sh executable: chmod +x studio.sh
Type ./studio.sh


A pop up will be shown asking for installation settings. In my particular case, it is a fresh install so I'll go with selecting I do not have a previous version of Studio or I do not want to import my settings.

If you choose to import settings anyway, you may need to close any old project which is opened in order to get a working Android SDK. 



From now onwards, setup wizard will guide you.



Android Studio can work with both Open JDK and Oracle's JDK (recommended). Incase, Open JDK is installed the wizard will recommend installing Oracle Java JDK because some UI and performance issues are reported while using OpenJDK.

The downside with Oracle's JDK is that it won't update with the rest of your system like OpenJDK will.

The wizard may also prompt about the input problems with IDEA .

Select install type



Verify installation settings



An emulator can also be configured as needed. 



The wizard will start downloading the necessary SDK tools 

The wizard may also show an error about Linux 32 Bit Libraries, which can be solved by using the below command:

sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1

After this, all the required components will be downloaded and installed automatically.

After everything is upto the mark, just click finish



To make a Desktop icon, go to 'Configure' and then click 'Create Desktop Entry'
