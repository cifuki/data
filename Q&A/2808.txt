Q:I'm using a library that has the below in its Manifest.

<application android:allowBackup="true"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:supportsRtl="true"/>


However, as the application that I use to include the library the reverse of the setting instead

<application android:allowBackup="false"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:supportsRtl="false"/>


Hence it would have merger error like Is `android:supportsRtl="true"` in the Library Manifest essential? It is causing error sometimes

To solve it, we just need to add the following to our Manifest application.

tools:replace="android:supportsRtl"


and

tools:replace="android:allowBackup"


However, adding two tools:replace will have error in compilation. How could I combine the two tools:replace?

I tried the below, and it's not working.

tools:replace="android:supportsRtl|android:allowBackup"
