Q:I'm building an Android application, which makes use of a manifest broadcast receiver to know when the device is plugged in. 
I think Android 5.0 JobScheduler API would be a much better way of doing this, but I have one question: is it possible to use this API or a similar one on earlier versions of Android?
If it is not possible, what would be the best option to do this (instead of a manifest broadcast receiver)?

A:Important Update

For Now onward everybody should use WorkManager for deferrable background tasks.


This library is backward compatible 
It use JobScheduler,FirebaseJobDispatcher or AlarmManager
No Need to depend on play service library.
Recommended by Google for deferrable background work.
Can use features like chaining, constraints etc.
