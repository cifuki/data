Q:I'm starting with the new Google service for the notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging. 

Thanks to this code https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/tree/master/messaging I was able to send notifications from my Firebase User Console to my Android device.

Is there any API or way to send a notification without use the Firebase console? I mean, for example, a PHP API or something like that, to create notifications from my own server directly.

A:Firebase Cloud Messaging has a server-side APIs that you can call to send messages. See https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server. 

Sending a message can be as simple as using curl to call a HTTP end-point. See https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server#implementing-http-connection-server-protocol

curl -X POST --header "Authorization: key=<API_ACCESS_KEY>" \\
    --Header "Content-Type: application/json" \\
    https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send \\
    -d "{\\"to\\":\\"<YOUR_DEVICE_ID_TOKEN>\\",\\"notification\\":{\\"body\\":\\"Yellow\\"},\\"priority\\":10}"
