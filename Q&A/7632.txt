A:Check this  Once you have a virtual SD card in your emulator, if you're not comfortable with mtools or if you don't know how to mount a loopback device on Linux (which is really easy by the way), just use adb push to upload your images. Possible example:

adb shell mkdir /sdcard/Pictures
adb push mypic.jpg /sdcard/Pictures
