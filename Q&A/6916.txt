Q:I have an activity with a search box (EditText) on the top, and a ListView below. Whenever the activity starts, the EditText always has focus and bring up the keyboard which partially cover the ListView. 

There's no other text view that can have focus.
I want the EditText to have focus ONLY when the user touches it and start typing. I try to put clearFocus() in onCreateView, onViewCreated or onCreated, but no luck.

A:Set in your parent layout next attributes:

<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/mainLayout"
    android:descendantFocusability="beforeDescendants"
    android:focusableInTouchMode="true" >


And now, when activity starts this layout getting default focus.

Also we can remove focus from children views in runtime (e.g. after finishing child editing):

findViewById(R.id.mainLayout).requestFocus();


or

Look in the AndroidManifest.xml  element.

android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden"


It always hide key board when entering the activity.
