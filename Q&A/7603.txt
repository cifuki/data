Q:I want to have a View that initially is invisible and when I press a button, it becomes visible with a fade in animation. I'm using the AlphaAnimation for the fading effect. The problem is that if I make the view invisible the animation can't be seen.

Thanks a lot,

Gratzi

A:Provide an AnimationListener to the Animation and make the View visible as soon as the Animation starts.
