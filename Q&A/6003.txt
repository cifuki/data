Q:I just downloaded the Android Studio .dmg for OSX.  Per the installation instructions, I've dragged it to the application folder and launched the application.  

But the SDK Manager and AVD Manager are greyed out and are impossible to use.  

Any ideas on an installation step I may have missed?

A:For people coming for this same problem for Windows: you won't have an Android SDK anywhere if it is your first time with Android. Also, here the Android Studio doesn't come with a packed SDK Manager, so you need to download one.

So this is what you may do:

Download the SDK Manager and an Android SDK


Download the SDK Manager from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/. Use the link that says "Get the SDK for an existing IDE".
Execute the downloaded installer.
Execute this program with administrator rights: SDK Manager.exe
Download the proposed SDK (if you get errors regarding the SDK Manager couldn't create some folders, remember it should be executed as administrator).


Configure Android Studio to work with the new SDK


Open Android Studio and in the Quick Start window click "Configure", you will see the SDK Manager greyed out.
Go to "Project Defaults", then to "Project Structure" and there it will ask for the path where you installed the SDK.
If you click OK and go back you will see the SDK Manager is no longer greyed out, and now you can start creating projects.
