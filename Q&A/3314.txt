Q:I just upgraded my android studio from 1.5 to 2.0.And now I am facing some weird bug when I try to start Emulator. I use Ubuntu 15.10 OS

Android monitor returns this message

sh: 1: glxinfo: not found
sh: 1: glxinfo: not found
libGL error: unable to load driver: r600_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: r600

When I was using 1.5 version all was going good. Is it a bug in android studio 2.0.

How to remove this error?

A:Verify that you have installed in your system lib64stdc++6 

With a 32 bits operating system :

# apt-get install lib64stdc++6


With a 64 bits operating system with multiarch enabled :

#\xc2\xa0apt-get install lib64stdc++6:i386


Then link the new installed libraries to the android sdk tools path

$ cd $ANDROID_HOME/android-sdk-linux_x86/tools/lib64/libstdc++
$ mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bak
$ ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 $ANDROID_HOME/android-sdk-linux_x86/tools/lib64/libstdc++


EDIT: in 15.10 x64 with current Sdk (23), the folder is $ANDROID_HOME/Sdk
