Q:I'm trying to use java 8 in my project and for that I added the jack compiler.

After enabling jack I started having problems with libraries that use Annotation Processing and looking in the web I read that I need android studio 2.2 and com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.0-alpha6 to compile libraries that generate code from annotations.

I download Android Studio 2.2 preview 6 and converted my project to it. And after that I discovered that the apt gradle plugin is not supported anymore and then I needed to change every dependency that use apt to the use the new annotationProcessor option.

Ex:

apt "org.projectlombok:lombok:$rootProject.lombokVersion"


to

annotationProcessor "org.projectlombok:lombok:$rootProject.lombokVersion"


Now if I use "make project" the project is compiled without problems, but if I try to execute it I have errors with the code that should be generated by the annotations.

Also when I open the project I receive a warning from the lombok plugin "Annotation processing seems to be disabled for the project". When I open the project settings and go to "Build -> Compiler" I can't find Annotation  Processors.

So, my question is: How can I enable Annotation Processors in Android Studio 2.2? This feature was disabled? If yes, how can I generate the code from annotations?

--EDIT--
I'm making a PullRequest to change the project to compile with Java8, you can check the PR here: https://github.com/jonathanrz/myexpenses-android/pull/57

A:Close the project. In the "Welcome to Android Studio" dialog click "Configure" in the bottom right corner.

Then,


  Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors. Tick 'Enable annotation processing'.


If that does not work. Delete the project from "Welcome to Android Studio" dialog and open from new.

Worked for me.
