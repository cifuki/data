Q:I would like to have a MapView inside a ScrollView, however when I try to scroll the map, the ScrollView takes priority! Is there a way to give the MapView priority when scrolling inside the map, and the ScrollView otherwise?

Thanks!

A:I have had a same problem for 10 days, but I got a solution a few minutes ago!!
Here is the solution.
I made a custom MapView and override onTouchEvent() like this.

@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
    int action = ev.getAction();
    switch (action) {
    case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
        // Disallow ScrollView to intercept touch events.
        this.getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true);
        break;

    case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP:
        // Allow ScrollView to intercept touch events.
        this.getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false);
        break;
    }

    // Handle MapView's touch events.
    super.onTouchEvent(ev);
    return true;
}
