Q:I've downloaded and installed the Genymotion emulator plugin via the plugin wizard in Android Studio. I'm running Android Studio on a Windows machine.

I'm getting a warning saying that I must provide a path to Genymotion folder:



Where is this folder located? I can not seem to find it in my Android Studio installation folder.

A:For windows, the default path is C:\\Program Files\\Genymobile\\Genymotion

On a Mac, you will find it here: /Applications/Genymotion.app

You have to enter it inside the Android Studio settings, under Genymotion section.
