Q:I'm building an Android application and would like to maintain a few environment variables that I can tweak depending on whether I'm in development mode or release mode. For example, I need to invoke a web service and the URL will be slightly different in either mode.  I'd like to externalize this and other settings so I can change them easily based on my target deployment.

Are there any best practices or anything in the SDK to assist with this need?

A:According to this stackoverflow post, in SDK Tools version 17 (we're on 19 as of this writing) adds a BuildConfig.DEBUG constant that is true when building a dev build.
