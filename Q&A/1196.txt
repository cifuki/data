I am trying my hands on developing a simple android application in which I am trying to use sqlcipher, which uses .so libraries internally. I have read the documentation on how to use sqlcipher with android app. I have followed the steps and it compiles without any error. But, at runtime it throws UnsatisfiedLinkError.

Googling around for it, I found that, gradle doesn't support .so libraries yet, but I found a hack here which I am trying to use. But it throws compile time error at line #40 on the gist which is,

tasks.withType(com.android.build.gradle.PackageApplicationTask) { pkgTask ->
    pkgTask.jniDir new File(buildDir, 'native-libs')
}


saying 


  Could not find property 'com' on Project 'MyProject'


Here I am posting code from my build.gradle file.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'http://repo1.maven.org/maven2' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.4'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'android'

dependencies {
    compile files('libs/android-support-v4.jar')
    compile files('libs/commons-codec.jar')
    compile files('libs/guava-r09.jar')
    compile files('libs/sqlcipher.jar')
}

targetCompatibility = 1.6
sourceCompatibility = 1.6

android {
    target = 'android-14'

    compileSdkVersion 17
    buildToolsVersion "17.0.0"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 9
        targetSdkVersion 16
    }    

}

task copyNativeLibs(type: Copy) {
    from(new File(project(':MyProject').buildDir, 'native-libs')) { include '**/*.so' }
    into new File(buildDir, 'native-libs')
}

tasks.withType(Compile) { compileTask -> compileTask.dependsOn copyNativeLibs }

clean.dependsOn 'cleanCopyNativeLibs'

tasks.withType(com.android.build.gradle.PackageApplicationTask) { pkgTask ->
    pkgTask.jniDir new File(buildDir, 'native-libs')
}


Can, anybody please help me on what I have done wrong or what should I do to include those .so libraries in my apk?

As I am new to android development and gradle, please apologize me if I have misunderstood something.

A:I had the same problem. Check out the comment in https://gist.github.com/khernyo/4226923#comment-812526

It says:


  for gradle android plugin v0.3 use "com.android.build.gradle.tasks.PackageApplication"


That should fix your problem.
