Q:I have a TextView that is X lines long. How do I get the text that is at, say, line 3?

Example: I have this TextView

This is line 1

And this is line 2

And this is line 3

I want to be able to get the String at any one of these lines by itself, such as getting the String at line 3 would return "And this is line 3". Searching for line breaks is not the solution I need, as it doesn't take into account text wrapping.

A:You can use textView.getLayout().getLineStart(int line) and getLineEnd to find the character offsets in the text.

Then you can just use textView.getText().substring(start, end) -- or subsequence if you are using Spannables for formatting/etc.
