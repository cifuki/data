Q:I am trying to run an app that I made in phonegap on my device, connected with USB.

-> phonegap run android
[phonegap] detecting Android SDK environment...
[phonegap] using the local environment
[phonegap] compiling Android...
[phonegap] successfully compiled Android app
[phonegap] trying to install app onto device
[phonegap] no device was found

-> adb devices
List of devices attached 
SH25PW103163    device


I just ran a native Android app in eclipse on this device, I have USB Debugging activated.

What can be wrong?

A:If you have only one adb-capable device, use this command:

phonegap run android --device

If you have more than one you will need to specify the device ID this way:

phonegap run android --device=<device-id>

Example:

phonegap run android --device=SH25PW103163

phonegap run android --target=SH25PW103163

If you want to know the code of a device execute this in the console (shell, terminal):

adb devices
