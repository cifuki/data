Q:I have a multiple Android devices connected to the computer. When I try to run the app I'm developing, the Android Studio always prompt me to choose the device. Is there any way to deploy the app on a multiple devices automatically - by clicking Run or even better with a shortcut?

A:This is almost too easy, actually. When you see the list of devices come up after launching the app, just shift or control click each device you want it to launch on. Just discovered this by accident. Hope it helps.
