Q:I'm all new to Android and I'm trying to create a spinner programmatically and feeding it with data from an array, but Eclipse gives me a warning that I can't handle.

Here's what I got:


  This ArrayList holds the elements that should be in the spinner (gets
  filled from a file later on):
  
  ArrayList<String> spinnerArray = new ArrayList<String>();


This is code I found on a site which should create the spinner:

Spinner spinner = new Spinner(this);
ArrayAdapter spinnerArrayAdapter = new ArrayAdapter(this,
                android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item,
                spinnerArray);
spinner.setAdapter(spinnerArrayAdapter);


Now the second line (ArrayAdapter...) gives me a warning in Eclipse saying "ArrayAdapter is a raw type... References to generic type ArrayAdapter<T> should be parameterized", I have no idea how to fix this (or what that means in the first place :) ).

It's just a warning and the App seems to run alright, but I'd still like to understand what's wrong and fix it. Any hint is appreciated.

Greetings,

A:ArrayAdapter<String> should work.

i.e.:

Spinner spinner = new Spinner(this);
ArrayAdapter<String> spinnerArrayAdapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>
            (this, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item,
           spinnerArray); //selected item will look like a spinner set from XML
spinnerArrayAdapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout
                                                     .simple_spinner_dropdown_item);
spinner.setAdapter(spinnerArrayAdapter);
