Q:In the developer preview for Android N, multi-window support is enabled by default.  How can I disable it for activites?  Also what will happen if a multi-window enabled app launches my disabled activity?

A:In your manifest, you need: 

android:resizeableActivity="false"


So in your manifest file, for each activity that you want to disable the feature in, it would be like:

<activity android:name=".SomeActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:resizeableActivity="false" />


Or, if you want to disable it in your entire app:

<application 
   android:resizeableActivity="false" >
    . . .
</application>


As for what will happen, Android just won't let your app go into multi-screen mode - it will just stay full screen. See https://developer.android.com/preview/features/multi-window.html and https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#resizeableActivity.
