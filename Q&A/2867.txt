Q:I am new to Android. Currently, I have the adt-bundle-windows-x86-20131030.zip (Windows 32 bit) installed - and have successfully installed the Android SDK and Eclipse. Also, I have updated everything in the Android SDK manager. Now, I am working in Android v-4.4.2

My project runs successfully, but when I import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity; and import android.support.v7.app.ActionBar; the project won't debug. I get the error The Import android.support.v7 cannot be resolved

I searched in Google and installed Android Support Library then added v7 in my project. 


File->Import (android-sdk\\extras\\android\\support\\v7). Choose "appcompat"
Project-> properties->Android. In the section library "Add" and choose "appCompat"


Screenshot



Successfully added in appCompat but still I am still getting the error.
