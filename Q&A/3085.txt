Q:In Google Maps for Android v1, MapView had a convenience method: 
getMapCenter().  Now I cannot figure out how to get map center with v2 of this api.  I have perused the API documentation, but there is no mention of such a feature.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Igor

A:I had the same problem. It seems you can get the center this way:

mMap.getCameraPosition().target


where mMap is the GoogleMap instance from your activity. This will return a LatLng object which basically represents the center of the map. 

Note that the GeoPoint class is not available anymore. 

According to http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition.html

target is "The location that the camera is pointing at." (I tested it with the sample code and it worked okay for me)
