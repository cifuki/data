Q:In my app, I'd like to use the camera, if the device has one. Are there any devices running android that do not have a camera? By including the following into my manifest:

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>


then it's basically saying "I'll use a camera if one exists, but don't need one to run the app". 

How could I check if a camera exists on the device, before attempting to use the Camera class?

A:I've not tried it, but:

private android.hardware.Camera mCameraDevice;

try {
  mCameraDevice = android.hardware.Camera.open();
} catch (RuntimeException e) {
  Log.e(TAG, "fail to connect Camera", e);
  // Throw exception
}


May be what you need.
