Q:I am using following line in android ant build (project.properties):

dex.force.jumbo=true


Now we are migrating from ant to Gradle. Is it possible to get jumbo mode active in Android Gradle build?

A:You can modify your build.gradle file to include:

android {
    dexOptions {
        jumboMode = true
    }
}
