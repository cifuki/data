Q:I have lots of control repeated in my xml (a Button for instance). Is there any possibility to write the Button once in a xml and then import it in all the layout I need it?

A:You can use 

<include  layout="@layout/commonlayout" android:id="@+id/id" />


commonlayout.xml should be defined in res/layout where you can add the repeated parts.
