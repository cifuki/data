Q:I am creating an app with Fragments and in one of them, I created a non-default constructor and got this warning:

Avoid non-default constructors in fragments: use a default constructor plus Fragment#setArguments(Bundle) instead


Can someone tell me why this is not a good idea? 

Can you also suggest how I would accomplish this:

public static class MenuFragment extends ListFragment {
    public ListView listView1;
    Categories category;

    //this is my "non-default" constructor
    public MenuFragment(Categories category){
        this.category = category;
    }....


Without using the non-default constructor?

A:Make a bundle object and insert your data (in this example your Category object). Be careful, you can't pass this object directly into the bundle, unless it's serializable.
I think it's better to build your object in the fragment, and put only an id or something else into bundle. This is the code to create and attach a bundle:

Bundle args = new Bundle();
args.putLong("key", value);
yourFragment.setArguments(args);


After that, in your fragment access data:

Type value = getArguments().getType("key");


That's all.
