Q:are there any good examples or tutorials on how best to structure an android applications anywhere?

am new to java and android and i've built winforms apps using passive and supervising controller variants of model view presenter and model view controller in asp.net but not really seen any examples or code on android that use these sorts of patterns.

how do people structure decent size android apps out there in the wild. are there any best practices or should i be sticking rigidly to official android documentation.

A:Try with the following two examples. I've found them useful in understanding how MVP might apply to Android applications.
