Q:I want to run my Web App, which i programmed with HTML5, in fullscreen mode on Android.
(hide the status bar, and the adress/navigation bar)

for iOS you only write:

<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" /> 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


But that did not work on Android.

There are a lot of solution\xc2\xb4s with Javascript, but all solutions which I tried are inoperative.

Somebody know the solution?

A:I do not think you will find a global solution for that since not everybody uses the default android webbrowser (e.g. I prefer dolphin).

Facing that fact you will need to try every dirty javascript hack to force that behavior.

The only reason why this works for apple devices is the fact that apple is very restrictive about developing a custom browser and everybody sticks to the default app.
