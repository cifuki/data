Q:I have recently started learning the new ConstraintLayout in Android Studio 2.2 and noticed that when I add simplest of the views, the layout editor automatically generates some absolute coordinates. Here is a sample XML:

<android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/activity_portfolio"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context="com.abc.Activity"
    tools:layout_editor_absoluteX="0dp"
    tools:layout_editor_absoluteY="81dp">

    <TextView
        android:text="@string/creator_name"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        tools:layout_editor_absoluteX="246dp"
        tools:layout_editor_absoluteY="479dp"
        android:id="@+id/first_textview"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="@+id/activity"
        android:layout_marginEnd="16dp"
        tools:layout_constraintRight_creator="0"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="@+id/activity"
        android:layout_marginBottom="16dp"
        tools:layout_constraintBottom_creator="0" />
</android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout>


Notice the absolutes like 81dp, 246dp, 479dp... I tried to manually delete these, but when I go back to the "Design" tab and come back to the "Text" tab, these regenerate. Now, I have three questions:


Is there a way to tell Android Studio to not generate these?
Should I manually place them in dimens.xml?
Would these absolutes cause some layout problems in other devices?

A:You'll note that all of the absolute values are in the tools namespace - this means they are not compiled into your app, nor used in anything but in the tools (and in this case, the visual editor). They are simply to ensure that switching from the Design to Text tab is always consistent, with the underlying files remaining stable.

No.

These are only useful for the tools and therefore should not be added to a separate dimens.xml file that would be included in your final APK.

No, they are only used by the tools.
