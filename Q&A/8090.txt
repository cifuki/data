Q:I'm trying to import an android project into Eclipse (from Git, but I don't think it's relevant), and I can't run or compile it because I get these errors:

Android requires compiler compliance level 5.0. Please fix project properties.  Serval-Video-Discovery      line 1  Android ADT Problem 
Project 'Serval-Video-Discovery' is missing required source folder: 'gen'   Serval-Video-Discovery      Build path  Build Path Problem


I think the first one isn't really a big problem, even if I don't really understand the warning.

The funny thing is that the "gen" folder exists on the filesystem; furthermore, I can't try to create it because it already exists !

What should I do to solve this issue?

Here is the GitHub repo I'm trying to import from: https://github.com/rbochet/Serval-Video-Discovery
