Q:The Android SDK offers the standard menu icons via android.R.drawable.X. However, some standard icons, such as ic_menu_refresh (the refresh icon), are missing from android.R.

Is there any way to get the original icons, maybe by extracting them from the applications? I already checked the Android source, but it's a bit too huge to look everywhere for the images.

I know the Android Drawables website, but I would like to get the correct hdpi, mdpi and ldpi version, preferable the original ones.

A:Never mind, I found it in the source: base.git/core/res/res and subdirectories.

As others said in the comments, if you have the Android SDK installed it\xe2\x80\x99s also on your computer. The path is [SDK]/platforms/android-[VERSION]/data/res.
