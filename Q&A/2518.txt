A:You can use 

mDrawerLayout.setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED);

to lock your DrawerLayout so it won't be able to open with gestures. And unlock it with: 

mDrawerLayout.setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED);

Here you can find more info about DrawerLayout: Android API - DrawerLayout
