Q:Due to this question
I want to use class StringEscapeUntils in package org.apache.commons.lang3.

But when I try to import Apache lib by add line compile 'org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:4.0' to build.grade file then can not import the class above.

Is there any one can help me how to import above one to my project via gradle (not by download .jar and put them into project folder).

A:Edited 07.12.2018:

I think dependency for StringUtils you are using is not proper.

Please add below dependency to gradle and Sync project and import your class.

implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.6'


This on is using deprecated task (but should still works):

compile 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.5'

Edit:

As OoDeLally mentioned in a comment, 

Above mentioned version is deprecated,
Please use below dependency: 

implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.6'


Thanks!
