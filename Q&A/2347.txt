Q:I am trying to use an intent to send an email from my application but the To field of the email will not populate. If I add code to fill in the subject or text, they work fine. Just the To field will not populate.

I have also tried changing the type to "text/plain" and "text/html" but I get the same problem. Can anyone help please?

public void Email(){

    Intent emailIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND); 
    emailIntent.setType("message/rfc822");  //set the email recipient
    String recipient = getString(R.string.IntegralEmailAddress);
    emailIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL  , recipient);
    //let the user choose what email client to use
    startActivity(Intent.createChooser(emailIntent, "Send mail using...")); }


The email client I'm trying to use is Gmail

A:I think you are not passing recipient as array of string

it should be like

emailIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL,new String[] { "someone@gmail.com" });
