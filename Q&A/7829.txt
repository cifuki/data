Q:I want to develop an application in which i want to display information about places nearby (within 1km )the user by getting its current location.. 

Say for example i want to display information about Restaurants, Shopping Malls, Hospitals located within 1km related to current location of the android device..

I have gone through this link : Using Google Places API in Android.. But didnt get more.

Have anyone used Google Places API in android ?

A:Some points to keep in mind:


In order to use Google\xe2\x80\x99s Places API, you will need to register and obtain a Google Map\xe2\x80\x99s API Key. 
In class UrlSigner in the tutorial the variable descriptions are: keyString => is your Google Map api key. urlString is the url you want to sign using the api key.
In code you will find inputKey and inputUrl. these 2 variables are just for testing purpose you can omit them if you want. You can directly write code as follows:

URL url = new URL(urlString);

UrlSigner signer = new UrlSigner(keyString);

String request = signer.signRequest(url.getPath(),url.getQuery());

System.out.println("Signed URL :" + url.getProtocol() + "://" + url.getHost() + request);


in main method of UrlSigner class.
