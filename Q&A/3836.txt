Q:We have an android gradle project. Today I wanted to upgrade the android build tools version from 20 to 21.0.1, but now the aapt is failing.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':myproject-android:processDebugResources'.
> com.android.ide.common.internal.LoggedErrorException: Failed to run command:
        c:\\_DEVELOP\\AndroidSDK\\sdk\\build-tools\\21.0.1\\aapt.exe package -f --no-crunch -I c:\\_DEVELOP\\AndroidSDK\\sdk\\platforms\\android-16\\android.jar -M D:\\_MY_PROJECT\\trunk\\myproject_bin\\gradle\\build\\re

Error Code:
        255


I had some warnings saying:

libpng warning: iCCP: Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been edited


I fixed those, but there are 6 more in the appcompat-v7 library.

If I revert the build tools version to 20 everything works fine.

Has anyone came across this problem?

A:This is caused by a faulty aapt. There was a similar problem in 21.0.0 too (Error Code: -1073741819). You need to update build-tools again to fix it.


Open SDK manager and install build-tools 21.1.2.
Then change your build.gradle so that it looks like this.

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 21
        buildToolsVersion "21.1.2"



Replace version numbers with the most recent ones as necessary.

Old buildToolsVersion 21.0.2, recommended version is 21.1.2 or later
