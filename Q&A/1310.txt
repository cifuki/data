Q:I have an activity which extends PreferenceActivity.
I'm loading preferences from the xml file.
But in some cases i need completely hide one of the preferences from the screen based on my app state. There is a setEnabled method, but it's not exactly what i want. I want to remove that preference from the screen completely.
Is it possible ?

A:Yes, if you have a reference to both the Preference, and its parent (a PreferenceCategory, or PreferenceScreen)

myPreferenceScreen.removePreference(myPreference);
