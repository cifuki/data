Q:I would like to add a shared elements transition using the navigation architecture components, when navigating to an other fragment. But I have no idea how. Also in the documentations there is nothing about it. Can someone help me?

A:I took reference from this github sample
https://github.com/serbelga/android_navigation_shared_elements

cardView.setOnClickListener{
  val extras = FragmentNavigatorExtras(
    imageView to "imageView"
  )
  findNavController().navigate(R.id.detailAction, null, null, extras)
}

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
  sharedElementEnterTransition = TransitionInflater.from(context).inflateTransition(android.R.transition.move)


It is working properly.
