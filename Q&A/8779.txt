Q:My adb is down, no matter I am using ADT or Android Studio.

And according to the second answer of this SO question, I did:


I type:

adb nodaemon server


Output:

cannot bind 'tcp:5037'

Then netstat -ano | findstr 5037

I did find a pid of 7416 who listen in 127.0.0.1:5037
I use taskkill /pid 7416 -f to kill it.
I type netstat -ano | findstr 5037 again, I found another pid listens at 127.0.0.1:5037 again!


I guess they are the same, but I have no idea who it is.

Can I simply have a easy way to release this port or change the adb port to another one?

A:In my case I was trying to use genymotion emulator device.
With genymotion opened and running, I've tried to run my app in this emulator but I it doesn't worth

In this part I had this error:

'C:\\Users\\Jose\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe,start-server' failed -- run manually if necessary


Then I've tried Jaskey's solution but it doesn't works.

So I stopped genymotion emulator. 
Then I restart ADB (Tools > Android > Unchecked Unable ADB Integration then I've checked again)

Next I've start genymotion emulator again
And now the app works on the emulator.
