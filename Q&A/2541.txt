Q:Go Launcher have a nice first-time tutorial. it is very similar to Stock ICS first time run. I want to learn how to make the similar tutorial display at the first launch of my app. How can I implement this Transparent view (which interacts with screen objects) in my android app?

A:I was trying to do something similar using a transparent activity with a viewpager inside it.  I wanted static 'tutorial' images that users could swipe through.  

One of the answers to my question mentioned an interesting library (called ShowcaseView).  It seems like it may be a good fit for your requirements as well.
