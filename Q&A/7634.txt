Q:I am converting ListView of my app to RecyclerView. On ListView, it was very easy to implement OnClickListener but in RecyclerView, we have to do it in adapter. I want to open a new Fragment when user clicks on a item. To do this I have to call FragmentManager in adapter which I am not able to do.
This is my code of RecyclerAdapter:

public ListItemViewHolder(View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
            title = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.title);
            description = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.description);
            itemView.setOnClickListener(this);
        }

        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            //Call FragmentManager and add Fragment to it.
            }
        }


So, how to call FragmentManager and add Fragments in it. Is there any better way than this like sendingBroadcast or any other method.

A:You just need an activity context passed in your constructor. Be sure to call new Adapter(this,...) from activities and new Adapter(getActivity(),...) from fragments.

private Context context;

@Override
public void onClick(View v) {
    FragmentManager manager = ((AppCompatActivity)context).getSupportFragmentManager();
}
