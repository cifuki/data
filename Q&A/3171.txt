Q:My app is being tested using Google Play. I am one of my alpha testers, naturally. I released a new alpha version of the app. I was expecting it to update automatically on my device. But it's not updating. Am I missing a step? According to Google


  Once they install the app and opt in, they'll automatically be updated
  to the new test version.

A:Nothing with Google Play is automatic. They have a caching system much like Apple App Store among others. From my experience, once or twice a day the cache system gets flushed and the market gets updated. 

At some point after that, the updates get pushed. This can be a multi-day process unfortunately.
