Q:I have uploaded two APK files into the Google Play store. One is a newer version and one is an older version. The newer version is the active one since it has a higher versionName and Code. Now I found some bugs in the newer version and I want to delete it from the Play Store and activate the older version. Google Play won't let me deactivate the newer one and activate the  older one again, since it has a lower versionName and code. 
The problem is that I'm am not the developer and did not build the app. The developer is in another country and it is difficult to get hold of them.

What can I do to reactivate the older version again? I know one solution would be to change the versionName and Code. I only have the apk file, can I change those details in Eclipse with only the apk file and very little experience in eclipse or developing android apps?

Thank You

A:You will not be able to change the APK file without having the signing certificate.

You should be able to revert to an older version, assuming you didn't change the level of API support.
