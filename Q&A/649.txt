Q:Please select at least one of the signature versions to use in Android Studio 2.3

Now while generating signed apk in Android Studio, it's showing two options(CheckBox) namely 1. V1(Jar Signature) and 2. `V2(Full APK Signature)' as Signature Versions in last step of signed apk generating process.



So, what is the difference between these V1(Jar Signature) and V2(Full APK Signature) in new Android Studio update?

And which should I use(or both) for signing apk for play store release?

Also I'm getting error Install Parse Failed No Certificates while installing apk when i use second option.

A:It is a new signing mechanism introduced in Android 7.0, with additional features designed to make the APK signature more secure.

It is not mandatory. You should check BOTH of those checkboxes if possible, but if the new V2 signing mechanism gives you problems, you can omit it.

So you can just leave V2 unchecked if you encounter problems, but should have it checked if possible.
