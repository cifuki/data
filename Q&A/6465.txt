Q:I have an Android scrollview with a white background. The fading edge is a white translucent gradient. I would like to change it be black instead of white. I have a ListView in the same project with a white background that has a black fading edge by default, but I can't find where (if anywhere) that was set.

A:Just found it out by trial and error.

Simply set android:background="@color/yourColor" for the <ScrollView>. It will set the shadow to the given colour.
