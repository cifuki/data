Q:As mentioned here, Android M will not support the Apache HTTP API.  The docs state to: 


  use the HttpURLConnection class instead.


or 


  To continue using the Apache HTTP APIs, you must first declare the following compile-time dependency in your build.gradle file:
  
  android { useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'
  }


I have converted much of my project's usage of HttpClient to HttpURLConnection, however, I still need to use the HttpClient in a few areas.  Hence, I am trying to declare 'org.apache.http.legacy' as a compile-time dependency but am getting an error in build.gradle:


  Gradle DSL method not found: 'useLibrary()'


My question is: how do I declare 'org.apache.http.legacy' as a compile-time dependency in my project?

Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks

A:For API 23:

Top level build.gradle - /build.gradle

buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.1'
    }
}
...


Module specific build.gradle - /app/build.gradle

android {
    compileSdkVersion 23
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.0"
    useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'
    ...
}


Official docs (for preview though): http://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html#behavior-apache-http-client
