Q:I don't want to see debug logs from adb logcat command. There are ton's of debug logs from my phone and i don't want to see them. 

adb logcat --help says " *:I " will output only info logs but is there any option to filter all logs except debug.

A:From the docs here, when you specify a log level filter, it will show all messages at that level and higher.  The levels are specified as:

The priority is one of the following character values, ordered from lowest to highest priority:

V \xe2\x80\x94 Verbose (lowest priority)
D \xe2\x80\x94 Debug
I \xe2\x80\x94 Info (default priority)
W \xe2\x80\x94 Warning
E \xe2\x80\x94 Error
F \xe2\x80\x94 Fatal
S \xe2\x80\x94 Silent (highest priority, on which nothing is ever printed)


Also, from the docs they say:


  The following filter expression displays all log messages with priority level "warning" and higher, on all tags:

adb logcat *:W



So with this in mind, passing the filter you mentioned *:I will log everything but Verbose and Debug logs. 

Unless your intention is to show Verbose as well as the other log levels, I don't think you can do that because specifying Verbose includes anything above Verbose.

If that is the case, it might be useful for you to filter on a specific tag instead of a specific log level, or some combination of both.
