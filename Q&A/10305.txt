Q:I am planning to create a cross platform application which works in Android, iPhone and Blackberry? I thought of using Phonegap or Titanium. My questions are as these: 


Whether in cross platform if it is possible to
achieve all the native behavior of
all phone models, something like in Android menu and iPhone gestures?
Apart from cross-platform
advantage, what are other
advantage do it have?
What are the disadvantages? Is
there any limitation when it comes to comparing to
native app?
Whether I can use same code
without any modification in all the devices or i have to
change the code with respective to
device identified dynamically?

A:Previous discussion on Stackoverflow: 
Comparison between Corona, Phonegap, Titanium

A good clear explanation from Jonathan Stark:

In terms of your questions:

To check which native features are available for each framework you will need to check the API docs of each of the frameworks:
The phonegap ones are here http://docs.phonegap.com/

The advantages/disadvantages I think are covered in the two links above.

It will depend what you are doing but I imagine you will have some differences in your code for each platform.

Hope that helps!
