Q:I set a click listener on a ViewPager, but the onClick event is never called. I guess the touch event detection of the ViewPager is interfering, but I can't see how to solve it...

Anybody could help?

Thanks

mViewPager.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        // never called
    }
});

A:Indeed the viewpager is interfering. But you can override the methods of the viewpager to make it do what you want. You'll need to override the ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) method.

You could just always return false to allow the touch events to fall through. I would also recommend calling super.onInterceptTouchEvent(ev) to allow swipes to keep working.

It passes in a MotionEvent, so you could check for clicks with that if you wanted.

Hope that helps. It should at least get you started. Post back with questions or further problems.

EDIT:

Note also that the ViewPager doesn't consume clicks. Therefore you could easily set an onclicklistener on any or all of the children of the viewpager if you wanted to capture clicks and potentially save yourself a lot of work.
