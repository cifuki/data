Q:Is there any simple way to turn Crashlytics Android SDK off while developing ? 

I don't want it to send a crash every time I do something stupid

On the other hand I don't want to comment out Crashlytics.start() and possibly risk forgetting to uncomment it and commit

A:Marc from Crashlytics here. Here's a couple of ways to disable Crashlytics while you are doing your debug builds! 


Use a different android:versionString for debug and release builds and then disable crash reporting from the Crashlytics web dashboard for the debug version.
Wrap the call to Crashlytics.start() in an if statement that checks a debug flag. You could use either a custom flag or an approach like the ones proposed here: How to check if APK is signed or "debug build"?
