Q:I think I'm getting senile because I was convinced that to give a name to your application, you had to fill this part of the manifest:

<application android:icon="@drawable/icon"  android:label="MyApplicationName">


However for a reason I don't understand, my application gets the name of my first activity, in which I load data, thus, it is called "Loading", defined as follows in the manifest: 

<activity android:name="AccueilSplash" android:label="Loading">



    
    
   
  

Any idea why that is?

A:The launcher actually shows android:label and android:icon for activity(ies) that declare

<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
</intent-filter>


so application label is of no use.
