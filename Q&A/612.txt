Q:While I'm doing something on my app, I see that the navigation drawer on my app reduced its size. But I'm not doing anything on that.



Then, after checking the code, I saw that setDrawerListener is deprecated. Does anyone has a solution to this? Any help will do. Thank you in advance!

drawerLayout.setDrawerListener(actionBarDrawerToggle);

A:Use addDrawerListener() instead.
