Q:I'm trying to use a font I found on the internet, but the problem is that I get an FC with "native typeface cannot be made".

Here is the code in the getView of my ListVIew:

        holder.tv_SuraName   =(TextView)convertView.findViewById(R.id.Start_Name);
        holder.tv_SuraName.setTypeface(Typeface.createFromAsset(mContext.getAssets(), "suralist_font.ttf"));


Can anyone tell me why can I use the custom rom? You can get it HERE .. the file is .ttf

A:The font file is either corrupt or unsupported for some reason. You can drop it on the SD card and load it from file, to make sure it's not a problem with your assets.
