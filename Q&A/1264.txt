Q:After upgrading my project to Android O

buildToolsVersion "26.0.1"


Lint in Android Studio is showing a deprecated warning for the follow notification builder method:

new NotificationCompat.Builder(context)


The problem is: Android Developers update their Documentation describing NotificationChannel to support notifications in Android O, and provide us with a snippet, yet with the same deprecated warning:

Notification notification = new Notification.Builder(MainActivity.this)
        .setContentTitle("New Message")
        .setContentText("You've received new messages.")
        .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notify_status)
        .setChannelId(CHANNEL_ID)
        .build();  


Notifications Overview

My question: Is there is any other solution for building notification, and still support Android O?

A solution I found is to pass the channel ID as a parameter in Notification.Builder constructor. But this solution is not exactly reusable.

new Notification.Builder(MainActivity.this, "channel_id")

A:It is mentioned in the documentation that the builder method NotificationCompat.Builder(Context context) has been deprecated. And we have to use the constructor which has the channelId parameter:

NotificationCompat.Builder(Context context, String channelId)


https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationCompat.Builder.html


  This constructor was deprecated in API level 26.0.0-beta1. use
  NotificationCompat.Builder(Context, String) instead. All posted
  Notifications must specify a NotificationChannel Id.

If you want to reuse the builder setters, you can create the builder with the channelId, and pass that builder to a helper method and set your preferred settings in that method.
