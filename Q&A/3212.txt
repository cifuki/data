Q:I have an Activity which uses a Fragment. I simply want to pass an object from this Activity to the Fragment.

How could I do it?
All the tutorials I've seen so far where retrieving data from resources.

EDIT :

Let's be a bit more precise:

My Activity has a ListView on the left part. When you click on it, the idea is to load a Fragment on the right part.

When I enter this Activity, an Object Category is given through the Intent. This Object contains a List of other Objects Questions (which contains a List of String). These Questions objects are displayed on the ListView.
When I click on one item from the ListView, I want to display the List of String into the Fragment (into a ListView).

To do that, I call the setContentView() from my Activity with a layout. In this layout is defined the Fragment with the correct class to call.
When I call this setContentView(), the onCreateView() of my Fragment is called but at this time, the getArguments() returns null.

How could I manage to have it filled before the call of onCreateView() ?
(tell me if I'm not clear enough)

Thanks

A:Create a static method in the Fragment and then get it using getArguments().

Example:

public class CommentsFragment extends Fragment {
  private static final String DESCRIBABLE_KEY = "describable_key";
  private Describable mDescribable;

  public static CommentsFragment newInstance(Describable describable) {
    CommentsFragment fragment = new CommentsFragment();
    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putSerializable(DESCRIBABLE_KEY, describable);
    fragment.setArguments(bundle);

    return fragment;
  }

  @Override
  public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater,
      ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {

    mDescribable = (Describable) getArguments().getSerializable(
        DESCRIBABLE_KEY);

    // The rest of your code
}


You can afterwards call it from the Activity doing something like:

FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
Fragment fragment = CommentsFragment.newInstance(mDescribable);
ft.replace(R.id.comments_fragment, fragment);
ft.commit();
