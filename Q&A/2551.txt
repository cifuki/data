Q:I know with the Gallery widget I was able to use getSelectedItemPosition(); to retrieve the current position, however it doesnt seem ViewPager has that.

I know I can setup a listener and retrieve the position when the page is switched. But I want the current view position.

A:Create a listener and set it on your viewpager:

/**
 * Get the current view position from the ViewPager by
 * extending SimpleOnPageChangeListener class and adding your method
 */
public class DetailOnPageChangeListener extends ViewPager.SimpleOnPageChangeListener {

    private int currentPage;

    @Override
    public void onPageSelected(int position) {
        currentPage = position;
    }

    public final int getCurrentPage() {
        return currentPage;
    }
}
