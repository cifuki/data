Q:I'm attempting to animate the removal of a ListView item using this:

    mListView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> adapterView, final View view, final int i, long l) {
            view.animate().setDuration(500).x(-view.getWidth()).alpha(0f);
            adapter.remove(tasks.get(i));
            adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
        }
    });


It does not work. I basically followed the advice of the 4th answer from the top of this post: 

How to Animate Addition or Removal of Android ListView Rows

However, there's some funny drawing stuff going on, or recycling, or something because while the animation occurs, the item below the one that slides off screen also gets deleted for some reason. The answer that the question asker eventually marked as correct is unfortunately an RTFM towards the whole of Android's source. I've looked through there, and I can't find the notifications pull-down in JellyBean which I'm trying to emulate.

TIA.

A:I just found a beautiful solution: https://github.com/paraches/ListViewCellDeleteAnimation

Many thanks to 'paraches' ;)

Edit

As of Android version 22.0.0 the new android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView is available as a successor of ListView. Standard add/remove/update animations are available out of the box. The widget animations are also easy to customize (few custom animations).

I strongly recommend switching from ListView to RecyclerView if you need custom item animations.
