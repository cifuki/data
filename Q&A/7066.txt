Q:I installed Android SDK and it's taking almost 7 GB on my (relatively small) SSD.

When I open Android SDK Manager I can see that everything is installed even older API versions.



Same thing for the Extras:



Can I safely un-install all the versions and only keep the latest one (API 17 in my case) ?

I use Andoid SDK Tools to develop Android Apps with eclipse.

Thank you.

A:Just delete the packages you want to uninstall.

You may still want to retain some of the older SDK's so as to try your apps on lower platform. I personally keep GB(API 10), ICS(API 14) and JB(API 17).

Also what you can try is just move the whole android SDK folder to a new location with relatively large storage, and then specify the new path in preferences in eclipse. Will save you some bandwidth, in case you later need those API's. My friend just copies from mine. Data here is very costly :(

You can deploy it, but you would have to mention it(that you want to run on lower APIs) on your manifest file. Also any API above the targeted device will not run and will interfere with your app design. Search for android TargetSDK version and MinimunSDK version.
