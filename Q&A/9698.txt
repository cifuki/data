Q:Just wondering how to hide the ICS back/home/etc software buttons programmatically. Just like the Youtube apps does when playing a video. I want to hide them while a video is playing, but bring them up if the user taps the screen.

I can't seem to find it anywhere on the web, or in Google's documentation.
