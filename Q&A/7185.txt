Q:I have a custom ScrollView (extended android.widget.ScrollView) which I use in my layout. I want to measure the total height of the contents of this scrollview. getHeight() and getMeasuredHeight() don't give me correct values (too high numbers).

Background information: I want to determine how far the user has scrolled. I use onScrollChanged to get the X value, but I need to know a percentage so I'll need the total scrollbar height.

Thanks a lot!

A:A ScrollView always has 1 child. All you need to do is get the height of the child to determine the total height:

int totalHeight = scrollView.getChildAt(0).getHeight();
