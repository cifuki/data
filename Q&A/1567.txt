Q:Whenever I create an ImageView with icon added using Android Studio's Vector Assets, I'm getting an error at the line app:srcCompat="@drawable/ic_play"

When I change the app:srcCompat with android:src, the error is gone but the icon looks pixelated. 

What is the main difference between 

app:srcCompat="@drawable/ic_play"


and

android:src="@drawable/ic_play"

A:app:srcCompat


  is the most foolproof method of integrating vector drawables into your app.Vector drawables allow you to replace multiple png assets with a single vector graphic, defined in XML. While previously limited to Lollipop and higher devices


Note 

As of Android Support Library 23.3.0, support vector drawables can only be loaded via app:srcCompat .

you need to add vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true to your build.gradle file

    // Gradle Plugin 2.0+  
 android {  
   defaultConfig {  
     vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true  
    }  
 }  


android:src


  Sets a drawable as the content of this ImageView.It will display in
  its original size. No automatic scaling .
