Q:I am developing an Android app whose orientation I don't want changed to landscape mode when the user rotates the device. Also, I want the locked orientation to be portrait mode on phones and landscape mode on tablets. Can this be achieved, if yes how? Thanks.

A:You just have to define the property below inside the activity element in your AndroidManifest.xml file. It will restrict your orientation to portrait.


  android:screenOrientation="portrait"


Example:

        <activity
            android:name="com.example.demo_spinner.MainActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:screenOrientation="portrait" >
        </activity>


Additionaly, as per Eduard Luca's comment below, you can also use screenOrientation="sensorPortrait" if you want to enable rotation by 180 degrees.
