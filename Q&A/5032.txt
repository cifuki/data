I have one Android Device running Jelly Bean OS.

Is there any way to detect the process is running or not using ADB command if i know the package name?

A:No need to use grep. ps in Android can filter by COMM value (last 15 characters of the package name in case of java app)

Let's say we want to check if com.android.phone is running:

adb shell ps m.android.phone
USER     PID   PPID  VSIZE  RSS     WCHAN    PC         NAME
radio     1389  277   515960 33964 ffffffff 4024c270 S com.android.phone


Filtering by COMM value option has been removed from ps in Android 7.0. To check for a running process by name in Android 7.0 you can use pidof command:

adb shell pidof com.android.phone


It returns the PID if such process was found or an empty string otherwise.
