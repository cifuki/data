Q:I am experimenting with the NotesList sample program in the Android SDK. I've made a slight variation in the program, but when I install my edited version I keep getting the message INSTALL_FAILED_CONFLICTING_PROVIDER in the console when I try to install it when the original notes program is already on the device. What do I need to change in the Provider to make it a unique database? It works fine if I uninstall the original notes program and then install my edited version.

A:The authority, as listed in android:authorities must be unique. Quoting the documentation for this attribute:


  To avoid conflicts, authority names should use a Java-style naming convention (such as com.example.provider.cartoonprovider). Typically, it's the name of the ContentProvider subclass that implements the provider
