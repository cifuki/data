Q:I am trying to achieve the following effect using FragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimations.


Fragment A is showing
Replace Fragment A with Fragment B. Fragment A should remain visible during the replacement.  Fragment B should slide in from the right. Fragment B should slide in OVER THE TOP of Fragment A.


I have no problem getting the slide in animation setup. My problem is that I cannot figure out how to make Fragment A stay where it is and be UNDER Fragment B while the slide in animation is running. No matter what I do it seems that Fragment A is on top.

How can I achieve this?

Here is the FragmentTransaction code:

FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
ft.setCustomAnimations(R.anim.slide_in_right, R.anim.nothing, R.anim.nothing,
    R.anim.slide_out_right);
ft.replace(R.id.fragment_content, fragment, name);
ft.addToBackStack(name);
ft.commit();


As you can see I have defined an animation R.anim.nothing for the "out" animation because I actually don't want Fragment A to do anything other than just stay where it is during the transaction.

Here are the animation resources:

slide_in_right.xml

<translate xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:duration="@android:integer/config_mediumAnimTime"
    android:fromXDelta="100%p"
    android:toXDelta="0"
    android:zAdjustment="top" />


nothing.xml

<alpha xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:duration="@android:integer/config_mediumAnimTime"
    android:fromAlpha="1.0"
    android:toAlpha="1.0"
    android:zAdjustment="bottom" />

A:I don't know if you still need an answer but I recently needed to do the same and I found a way to do what you want.

I made something like this :

FragmentManager fm = getFragmentManager();
FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();

MyFragment next = getMyFragment();

ft.add(R.id.MyLayout,next);
ft.setCustomAnimations(R.anim.slide_in_right,0);
ft.show(next);
ft.commit();


I display my Fragment in a FrameLayout.

It work fines but the older Fragment is still in my View, I let android manage it like he wants because if I put:

ft.remove(myolderFrag);


it is not displayed during the animation.

slide_in_right.xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
<set xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
<translate android:duration="150" android:fromXDelta="100%p" 
android:interpolator="@android:anim/linear_interpolator"
android:toXDelta="0" />
 </set>
