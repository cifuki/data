Q:I set up my Github with android studio, everything worked fine, the problem now is though, that I can't seem to turn off, or get out of version control to use the IDE normally again. 

This means that errors aren't shown, and it is really hard to debug because of this. 

So how do I turn off version control (VCS) in Android Studio?

A:To disable VCS in Android Studio on a Mac do the following:

Android Studio > Preferences...



In the Preferences window, select Version Control and under Directory choose VCS dropdown to be <none>



Don't forget to click "Apply" in the general Preferences buttons at the bottom.
