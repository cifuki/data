Q:How can I change the position of view through code? Like changing its X, Y position. Is it possible?

A:For anything below Honeycomb (API Level 11) you'll have to use setLayoutParams(...). 

If you can limit your support to Honeycomb and up you can use the setX(...), setY(...), setLeft(...), setTop(...), etc.
