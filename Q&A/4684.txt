Q:In a class belonging to a Library project I call:

webview.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/info.html", null);


Unfortunately, this only works if I duplicate the file info.html into the Application's project asset folder as well.

Is there a way to tell an Android library code: "look for this file in the library's assets folder, not in the application's assets folder" ?

A:From the Android Docs:


  Library projects cannot include raw assets
  
  The tools do not support the use of raw asset files (saved in the assets/ directory) in a library project. Any asset resources used by an application must be stored in the assets/ directory of the application project itself. However, resource files saved in the res/ directory are supported.


If you want to include files from a Library project, you'll need to put it in the resources instead of the assets. If you're trying to load HTML files from your library project into a WebView, this means that you'll have to go a more roundabout method than the usual asset URL. Instead you'll have to read the resource data and use something like loadData. 

This answer is out of date, the gradle build system and AAR files support assets.
