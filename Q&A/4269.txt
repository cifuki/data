Q:In my application I need to read Qr code. I searched the net and found Zing codes however lots of developers had problem with using it and it seems it is buggy!

If i assume that my customers has qr reader installed on their device, how can i use those applications and call them via implicit intents? 

if user doesn't have any qr reader, what will happen to the application? if it crashes, may i ask user to download for example QrDroid and after that use it?

A:try {

    Intent intent = new Intent("com.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN");
    intent.putExtra("SCAN_MODE", "QR_CODE_MODE"); // "PRODUCT_MODE for bar codes

    startActivityForResult(intent, 0);

} catch (Exception e) {

    Uri marketUri = Uri.parse("market://details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android");
    Intent marketIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW,marketUri);
    startActivity(marketIntent);

}


and in onActivityResult():

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {           
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == 0) {

        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            String contents = data.getStringExtra("SCAN_RESULT");
        }
        if(resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED){
            //handle cancel
        }
    }
}
