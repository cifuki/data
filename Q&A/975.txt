Q:When I try to run my WXGA800 emulator from Eclipse it's giving an error like this

Failed to allocate memory: 8
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.


I checked the following links also

Failed to allocate memory: 8

Android: failed to allocate memory

I have tried reducing RAM size in emulator and increasing Java heapsize and ramsize but still I am facing the same error.

A:Update: Starting with Android SDK Manager version 21, the solution is to edit C:\\Users\\<user>\\.android\\avd\\<avd-profile-name>.avd\\config.ini and change the value 

hw.ramSize=1024 


to 

hw.ramSize=1024MB




The emulator is really slow, hope they will release the intel images soon use the new API17 Intel x86 images if you want to change it .. (HAXM, Configuration)



Earlier Android SDK Manager releases:

Had the same problem with the built-in WXGA800 skin. I got it working by editing the virtual device setup to:


Target 4.0.3 API 15 / 4.1.0 API 16
SD-card 300MiB 
Resolution 1280 x 800 (set manually -not the built-in ones)
Device ram size 1024MB (with MB added to the number)
Abstracted LCD 160


Here my tablet config for 4.1.0 API 16
C:\\Users\\<user>\\.android\\avd\\<avd-profile-name>.avd\\config.ini

hw.lcd.density=160
sdcard.size=300M
skin.path=1280x800
skin.name=1280x800
hw.cpu.arch=arm
abi.type=armeabi-v7a
hw.cpu.model=cortex-a8
vm.heapSize=48
hw.ramSize=1024MB
image.sysdir.1=system-images\\android-16\\armeabi-v7a\\


This config shows the software keys too
