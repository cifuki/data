Q:I'm doing some debugging on an app that I'm working on, and in my LogCat, I continue to get a message with tag "AbsListView" and message "unregisterIRListner() is called."  Is there something I'm NOT doing within my code that would cause this?  Is it even something that I need to worry about?  I'd rather not post the (over) 550 lines of code I have for this.  Any information would be useful.  Thanks.

A:Looks like Google developers left debug call uncommented in source code.
To avoid this unusable LogCat output I'm using following filter:

tag:^(?!(dalvikvm|AbsListView))


This filter cut out all taged: dalvikvm and AbsListView debug lines.
