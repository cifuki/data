Q:I've tried looking at similar ones and no solution has worked. I've previously run apps without a problem but my new app suddenly started giving me problems. It always fails when I try to run it saying: 

Error:Execution failed for task ':app:preDexDebug'.
com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_67\\bin\\java.exe'' finished with non-zero exit value 1


Here is what the console displayed:

Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug]

Configuration on demand is an incubating feature.

This app is very simple and I have not changed it much from the stock layout. It is designed only for lollipop and uses only stock features. Here is the build.gradle:

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
android {
compileSdkVersion 22
buildToolsVersion "22.0.0"

defaultConfig {
    applicationId "com.package.app"
    minSdkVersion 21
    targetSdkVersion 22
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
}
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled false
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
}

dependencies {
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:22.0.0'
}

A:Had the same error encountered which was due to conflicting drawable resources.  I did a clean project and the error was no longer encountered.
