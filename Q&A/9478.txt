Q:I've been asked which format I need the music for my project in and, looking through the documentation, it seems that the Android platform offers a good choice.

Audio is certainly not my forte so I'm wondering if there's a specific format that is best suited for Android playback?  The main factors that come to mind are size and CPU overhead for decompression and playback.  (The music is to be played in the background of a game, but it's not a particularly CPU intensive game).

Any advice would be very welcome.

A:Ogg is the "free" choice, of course, and you are using Android. ;)

I'm not aware of any really significant differences in performance for decoding Ogg and Mp3 equivalent audio.

Mp3 might be the better choice if you intend to use your software on several platforms.  The implementation would probably be more consistent than Ogg.
