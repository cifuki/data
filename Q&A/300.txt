Q:The AVD manager in Android Studio doesn't show my device but "adb devices" does show it. Am I missing something obvious here?

A:To change what your application defaults to when you click run or debug in Android Studio, follow these steps:

1. go to Run 

2. Click on Edit Configurations 

3. Select the project

4. find the Target Device section under the General tab on the Android Application page. 

That seems to be where you toggle what the project builds to. If you're importing a project it actually defaults to Emulator, not sure why. You can also select "Open Select Deployment Target Dialog" to list both connected as well as emulated devices.
