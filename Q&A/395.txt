Q:I would like to make sure that the list is scrolled all the way to the bottom, after I have updated the listview by using listAdapter, so that it displays the last element entered in the list.  How can I do this ?

I tried this but no luck:

lv.setTranscriptMode(ListView.TRANSCRIPT_MODE_ALWAYS_SCROLL);


thank you

A:Supposing you know when the list data has changed, you can manually tell the list to scroll to the bottom by setting the list selection to the last row.  Something like:

private void scrollMyListViewToBottom() {
    myListView.post(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // Select the last row so it will scroll into view...
            myListView.setSelection(myListAdapter.getCount() - 1);
        }
    });
}
