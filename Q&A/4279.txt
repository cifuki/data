Q:How can I navigate to the error lines in a java file? 

Isn't there any better way than scrolling to them?

A:I searched for it and found the answer.

1- you can use F2 and SHIFT+F2 shortcut to navigate between errors in your document. if there is no error you will be navigated to the warnings.

2- another way that most of us know is to click on the red areas on the scrollbar.

here is the the link to the intelliJ IDEA help documents which is the base of Android Studio.

you can even press F2 in project window of Android Studio and it will select the files containing errors.

Also if there are no more errors it will point to warnings.
