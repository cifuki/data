A:Last night i got into PointClustering on Android MapView. Saw that there was nothing out for the community so i would like to share. 

Groups the geopoints if the projection of them in the mapView is too close. Also renders only the visible poins. 

UPDATE

Code reworked from scrach.

Now available at GitHub


Code Reworked from scratch
Used GVM clustering algorithm (pretty fast but doesn't position clustered point as good as mine)
Soon to add previous clustering algorithm too
