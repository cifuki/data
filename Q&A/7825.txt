Q:As the title mentioned, I have developed a simple NFC app in eclipse and I am trying to run it in the mobile device to debug my code. However, when I try to run it, this message came out, the problem even cannot launch. It said one operation left, but it seems like it has stopped. Have anyone met the similar problem before, or anyone know what is happening here?

A:I had exactly the same problem. For me helped adding '-clean' option at the first line of eclipse.ini file and restarting IDE. After adding this option eclipse clean all cached data in workspace each time it is started (that also mean it will be starting slower).
