Q:I tried to write a test demo for Google Map V2 in Android Studio. I followed every step from Androidhive Google Map V2 or better I think I need.

I'm using the same layout_main.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent" >

    <fragment
        android:id="@+id/map"
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

</RelativeLayout>


but I'm getting always the same rendering problem:


  Rendering Problems
  A <fragment> tag allows a layout file to dynamically include different layouts at runtime. At layout editing time the specific layout to be used is not known. You can choose which layout you would like previewed while editing the layout...


I have absolutely no idea what's the problem. Did I forget something?
I just need to add Google services in the build.gradle like

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.4.52'


I copied the manifest from the demo and changed the API Key.

This is just the preview window telling you that it can't display a preview for the <Fragment.../> tag, because it doesn't know what kind of fragment you're going to put in it.  You can safely ignore that message - your actual app will render the fragment fine when you run it (as long as you code it up correctly!).
