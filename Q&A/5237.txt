Q:Basic question on ADB.

adb root restarts adb as root. But what i want is to restart it back to user after some time.

I tried the following :

adb kill-server
adb start-server


doesnt work..

ps -A -> noted the process number of adb and killed it.. even this did not work. Finally i am restarting my device. Is there any way i can come back from root adb to general adb?

Thank you.

A:A little late I guess, but here it goes:
If you used - "adb root", you would have got the following message:

C:\\>adb root
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
restarting adbd as root


to get out of the root mode, you can use:

C:\\>adb unroot
restarting adbd as non root
