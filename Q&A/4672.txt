Q:Recently I've encountered following error :



The strangest thing is that I've just updated some package from sdk via working eclipse. There was no information or warning that after this update current adt will crash. I've checked latest updates and can't find new adt even on google's page. Even new adb contain old adt.

From http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/tools-notes.html:


  Dependencies: Android SDK Platform-tools revision 18 or later. If you
  are developing in Eclipse with ADT, note that this version of SDK
  Tools is designed for use with ADT 22.6.1 and later. If you haven't
  already, update your ADT Plugin to 22.6.1.


The only solution is to download new standalone eclipse and external plugin for it?
Does the android studio face the same problems?

Environment: linux x64.

A:Today me and one of my friends faced the same problem, so I have tried many things like restarting eclipse, checking updates, etc. but none was working for me.

Then I found a solution from Here and it's working as a charm for me and also for my friend.

Follow the steps here:


Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software.
Click Add, in the top-right corner.
In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter "ADT Plugin" for the
Name and the following URL for the Location:

https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
Click OK.


If you have trouble acquiring the plugin, try using "http" in the Location URL, instead of "https" (https is preferred for security reasons).


In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to
Developer Tools and click Next.
In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded.
Click Next. Read and accept the license agreements, then click
Finish.
If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or
validity of the software can't be established, click OK.
When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.
