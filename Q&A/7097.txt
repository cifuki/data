Q:Background

Recently we've updated the Facebook SDK library to 4.10 (from here).

Before, we had the same bug now and then, but now it seems it occurs a lot more often.

The problem

There is no way for us to understand where and why it occurs. 

Here's the crash log:


  Fatal Exception: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke
  interface method 'java.lang.Object com.facebook.inject.Lazy.get()' on
  a null object reference

         at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818)


And, since it's a report from Crashlytics, I also have some statistics:


usually (90%) occurs on Meizu devices, and the rest on LG, Samsung and others.
usually (72%) occurs on Android 5.1 versions, and the rest on all of the other versions we support (4.x and above).


What I've tried

I tried searching for the exception, but I can't find anything even similar to it.

I tried to find the "com.facebook.inject.Lazy" class, but this is nowhere to be found. I can't even find injection related classes and repos that the sdk uses for normal use. Only for unit testings.

I also tried to go to the Github website of Facebook (here), but there is nowhere to write there. 

Later I've found that this was reported on Facebook's developers website , but it doesn't seem that it's going to be fixed, and nobody knows how to handle it.

EDIT: now I've found this Facebook post, which says it might be because of using an old version of Facebook app, but it seem that it's incorrect.

The question

Why does it occur? Is there any workaround for this? Does Facebook work on a fix for this?

Is there any version of the Facebook SDK that this issue doesn't occur?

And, most importantly, How can it be handled and fixed?
