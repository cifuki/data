Q:What is the difference between Clean Project and Rebuild Project (in Android Studio)?


I had a problem with the R file about res ids, so I changed the file extension from gif to png and then [my build failed.]
I found the solution was to Rebuild Project.  This prompts my question above.

A:A clean just removes all build artifacts.  A rebuild does a clean followed by a build of your project.

EDIT #2 This is 100% true. Refer to this for a thorough demonstration of its correctness.
