Q:I've built an Android app which is now on Play Market. From time to time, I make updates to it, and I'd like to let users know that a new version is available.

How can I send an update notification to the users of the app?

A:You do not need to do anything specific for this. Since you mentioned that you are using Google Play, the update notification is taken care of by Google Play.

You just need to update the APK with a higher versionCode and Google Play should do the rest.
