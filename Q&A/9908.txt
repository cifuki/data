Q:I use MapsForge 0.8 to display maps in my Android app. When using online tiles (which are just bitmaps and not vector data that can be adjusted in the runtime renderer), the map is really tiny on my Hi-resolution device and I can't read anything. 



I would like to scale the map and I have tried the following:

mapView.getModel().displayModel.setDefaultUserScaleFactor(2.0f);


And:

mapView.getModel().displayModel.setUserScaleFactor(2.0f);


But it does not change anything.How to make it display the map bigger?

Update:

And I don't mean zooming in. I mean scaling the current zoom level to make it readable on high-resolution devices. Imagine the screenshot above on a small smartphone - it is tiny. I can't even read the street names.

2nd Update

The current answers below do NOT answer the question. This is about scaling Online tiles which are BITMAPS - and NOT how to influence rendering the vector data.

3rd Update

The accecpted answer finally solved the issue.

A:As per this documentaion,(Read Specifying the Position section) you can specify area to display and at what zoom level.

this.mapView.setCenter(new LatLong(52.517037, 13.38886));
this.mapView.setZoomLevel((byte) 12);


Above solution will work as it is provided in official documentation.

Apart from this I have also searched regarding this and find out we can also set MapPosition to MapViewPosition like(See this link).

MapPosition mapPosition1 = new MapPosition(new LatLong(52.517037, 13.38886), (byte) 12);
this.mapView.getModel().mapViewPosition.setMapPosition(mapPosition1);


Hope this will help you.
