Q:I'm working my way through APress's Beginning Android 2 and I've made it all the way to chapter 3, where we build a skeleton app. The book tells me to compile my application by typing "ant" in the command line, but my pc doesn't know what "ant" is yet. I checked in the SDK files and it looks like it wasn't included with the Android SDK. Does anybody know where ant is?

Thanks

A:Ant isn't included with the Android SDK. I suggest you get it from the official site.
