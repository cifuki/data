Q:I am developing an android application. I basically want to read the USSD responses into the application. Is there any API to do so? How to fetch these messages into application?

A:There is no API for USSD request yet. The ticket to create this API is not closed. But the community has found several hacks how to add this feature to their applications.


The first approach is to parse a log. Here is where you can find a class that do this. And here is a test application that uses this class.
Also there is a second approach.


Good luck!
