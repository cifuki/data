Q:When I open Android Studio, it loads the last project, and runs build. I really don't need it to do this. If I save a project with errors in it, because I haven't got time to fix them, but plan on doing it later, I don't really want the compiler to try to compile it next time I open the project, because it's just going to fail.

Also it's pointless building the project on startup even if it doesn't have errors, because if the project doesn't have errors, I always build it to test it before I stop working on it, so the new build will be completely redundant. Thanks if anyone knows of a way to disable this. I've tried Googling and searching the settings but can't find anything.

Edit: this has become even more annoying since I moved to a slower computer for development. It already takes long enough for Android Studio to start up, having the program build just slows the startup even more.

A:I've confirmed with a Google software engineer that this is currently not an option as of Android Studio 0.2.1. ( See 5th comment: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+XavierDucrohet/posts/1R2iPQzo4Zh )

I've also opened the following ticket as the engineer suggested:

Hopefully this will be resolved in the near future! Until then, I guess we'll have to open Android Studio and grab a cup of coffee while the build completes.
