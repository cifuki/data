Q:I have a LinearLayout that I've styled to look like a button, and it contains a few text/ImageView elements. I would like to make the whole LinearLayout act like a button, in particular to give it states that are defined in a  so it has a different background when it is pressed.

Is there a better way than making an ImageButton the size of the whole Layout and positioning absolutely?

A:I ran into this problem just now.  You'll have to set the LinearLayout to clickable.  You can either do this in the XML with

android:clickable="true"


Or in code with

yourLinearLayout.setClickable(true);


Cheers!
