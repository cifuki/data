A:Advice depends upon what you are trying to do.

If you are concerned that your controls take a long time to draw, and you want to draw to a bitmap so you can blit the bitmap rather than re-drawing via a canvas, then you don't want to be double-guessing the platform - controls automatically cache their drawing to temporary bitmaps, and these can even be fetched from the control using getDrawingCache()

If you want to draw using a canvas to a bitmap, the usual recipe is:


Create a bitmap of the correct size using Bitmap.createBitmap()
Create a canvas instance pointing that this bitmap using Canvas(Bitmap) constructor
Draw to the canvas
Use the bitmap
