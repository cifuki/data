Q:Is there a way to use the offline mode in Android apps using the Google Maps API?

Any direction to a tutorial or source code would be a massive help. I've been searching for hours without any luck. I know Google has released a way of using maps offline, but is it available for Android developers?

A:See this solution or this one.   Basically you just create your own tileprovider and access tiles locally. It is totally doable with the v2 API. API Reference

There's some false information floating around out there that the v2 Google Maps API requires an Internet connection. There was a but where the API would require a single access after app install to verify with Google Play services, but I believe this has been fixed.

See this and this.
