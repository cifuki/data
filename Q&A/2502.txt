Q:I want to reset Android Studio 0.2.13 to the default state. That means reset all settings, remove all projects, all gradle files so that it would act like a fresh installation. What steps do I have to follow to achieve this?

A:I only know how to do this on Windows (but it should be similar on any OS, you will just need to find the correct location yourself - google search would help with that).

On Windows:  

Go to your User Folder - on Windows 7/8 this would be:  

[SYSDRIVE]:\\Users\\[your username] (ex. C:\\Users\\JohnDoe\\)

In this folder there should be a folder called .AndroidStudioBeta or .AndroidStudio (notice the period at the start - so on some OSes it would be hidden).

Delete this folder (or better yet, move it to a backup location - so you can return it if something goes wrong).

This should reset your Android Studio settings to default.
