Q:Scope

There is a viewpager of two fragments. One of those fragments has a layout witch listens to onTouch changes at X-axis.

Problem

Layout doesn't get almost all Action.Move events when touching and sliding along X-axis.
It seems that viewpager has a onInterceptTouchEvent which returns true.

Question

Is it real to override viewpager's behavior to make it and my layout work together? So the perfect situation is layout intercepts all onTouch events on it and viewpager manages the rest of onTouch events. Thanks!

A:You are right, I believe every scrolling container intercepts touch events, but you can prevent it. You can put a touch listener on your layout:

public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
    switch (event.getAction()) {
    case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: 
        pager.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true);
        break;
    case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP:
    case MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL:
        pager.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false);
        break;
    }
}
