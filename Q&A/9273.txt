Q:Answered by me bellow

When I try to upload my .APK file i get this error:

Upload failed

I have tried cleaning my project, exporting it, and running it about 100 times over a span of almost 24 hours.  This is just an updated version of my .APK.  I have already successfully uploaded several updated .APK to the play store.  I changed the Version and I am using the same keystore for this update as I have for all my other updates.  Any suggestions?  And sorry that this isn't a code specific problem.  Also I only made a small edit to one of my activities.

A:The problem has nothing to do with using Chrome. The problem is your session is invalid. Using any different browser such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc. would create a new session and allow the upload to work. 

The real solution is to just log out and back in because whatever data Google uses to verify the upload is no longer valid, but they still allow you to navigate throughout your developer account like you are logged in with a valid session.
