Q:adb install foo.apk


When using this command, if the apk exists, I should get the error *Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS]*

 adb install -r myapp-release.apk


In this case,the existing apk will be replaced, by retaining old data
according to the docs, 


  '-r' means reinstall the app, keeping its data


Now how do I reinstall the app, but all previous data should be erased?

EDIT

I know we can do this

adb uninstall com.package.foo & adb install foo.apk


I just wanted to know if there is a command or something in adb itself.

A:Before the installation clean the data like this:

adb shell pm clear com.package.foo


then you can install normally using:

adb install foo.apk


or just run through your IDE
