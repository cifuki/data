Q:I understand that Content Providers are made to allow publicly sharing data between applications. However, I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts about making a Content Provider to use just within your own app. Would there be any advantages to doing this? Any disadvantages? 

In the past I've just implemented the SQliteOpenHelper to access data from my database, but I'm considering creating a Content Provider. I feel like the URI approach to requesting data is clear and concise. On the other hand, will using a Content Provider just for my application be redundant ( since within it I will have a SQliteOpenHelper class ) and more work than I need?

A:If you are not planning to share data, don't think about Content Providers. They are powerful but hard to write and it will be just silly to implement them if you are going to use them internally.

Of course... for instance, for an old TODO list app I wrote, I had to write a content provider to allow other apps retrieve and access the tasks states. It was part of the requirements, but more than that it made sense and made the app nicer.
