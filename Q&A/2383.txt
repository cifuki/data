Q:After the Android Studio 2.0 update while the gradle build  finishes I get this : 

Session 'app': Error Launching activity .

It prevents the app from starting but it's installed in my emulator.
This is what comes up in the Run tab :


  Unexpected error while executing: am start -n "com.example.user.ypologismosmoriwn/com.example.user.ypologismosmoriwn.MainActivity" -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER
  Error while Launching activity


Here is the code:

package com.example.user.ypologismosmoriwn;

import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}


It's just an empty Activity,nothing added

and the XML code is just a Relative Layout with 4 Texts and 3 Check Boxes

This is the logcat i am getting

Thanks anyone who is willing to help

A:I also faced this issue after I updated to AS2.0. I found that it is because of the instant run enabled. So my solution is to disable the "instant run". and it worked. To disable "instant run", you can go to Preference Dialog ( May be Setting dialog on Windows), then select Build, Execution, Deployment > Instant Run, and uncheck all the checkbox to disable Instant Run.

This is my temporary solution and it may help you. Later, I'll find a better way to this issue.

A better solution instead of disabling instant run.
Remove the .idea folder and .gradle folder, then click button Sync Project with Gradle Files (or through the menu File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files), after this process finished, you are able to run your app as normal.

Good Luck~
