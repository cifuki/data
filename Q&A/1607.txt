Q:Am I missing something or do Fragments not have a onRestoreInstanceState() method? If not, how do I go about attaining something similar?

A:Fragments do not have an onRestoreInstanceState method.

You can achieve the same result in onActivityCreated, which receives a bundle with the saved instance state (or null).

Check the source code here.
