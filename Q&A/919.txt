Q:Since the last update (Build from june 25) any changes in the Android studio Gradle is painfully slow. And it also seems to autotrack changes when you edit the file and recompile on keyup. 

Each change takes several minutes on my i5. 

Any idea how I can speed up my Gradle changes?

A:The dev are working on it. Like I posted in this answer the fastest solution right now is to use gradle from the command line and  you should switch to binary libs for all modules you do not develop. On g+ there is a discussion with the developers about it.
