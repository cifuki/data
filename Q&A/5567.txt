Q:Recently upgraded to Android Studio from 2.2.3 to 2., running on Win10

Emulator stopped working since then. Tried installing other images(25 rev 4)/upgrading for AVD but nothing seems to work. After running gradle and showing "waiting for target device to come online" in task bar nothing happens and program doesn't run.

Kindly help

A:I was also having the same issue 2 days ago when i update my android studio, today I solve my issue when I was playing around with settings then I saw that in my SDK tools setting Android Emulator is uncheck so I simply checked that box and now emulator is working fine.

Try this steps may work for you also:


Go to SDK tools > SDK Tools
Check Android Emulator and click Apply





UPDATE:

There are changes, though it's installed, you might need to update
