Q:I have system-level app with android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system" (UID: 1000).

Device is not rooted! INSTALL_PACKAGES permission is included to Manifest.

Can I install downloaded *.apk silently?

A:I`ve found the issue.


Added "android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES" permission.
I signed my application using "signapk.jar" with certificate that I`ve got from manufacturer of my device. 
And now this app can install others using "pm install /.../app.apk" without "su". 


It works!

P.S. Updating application using just "pm install" doesn`t replace existing application with new one, but returns exit_value = 0. So to update there are two ways:


use "pm install -r /.../app.apk";
firstly delete app using "pm uninstall com.mydomain.myapp" (you need "android.permission.DELETE_PACKAGES" permission) and then install new one.
