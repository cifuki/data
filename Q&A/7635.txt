Q:The golden rule is to set debuggable option to off prior to releasing your Android application to the public. 

What would happen if I leave (forget to turn off) this option on? I mean, how would it manifest to a user?

I tested and saw no difference.

A:how would it manifest to a user?
  


A normal user won't notice the difference.

By the way:


  
    Support for a true debug build. Developers no longer need to add the android:debuggable attribute to the  tag in the manifest \xe2\x80\x94 the build tools add the attribute automatically. In Eclipse/ADT, all incremental builds are assumed to be debug builds, so the tools insert android:debuggable="true". When exporting a signed release build, the tools do not add the attribute. In Ant, a ant debug command automatically inserts the android:debuggable="true" attribute, while ant release does not. If android:debuggable="true" is manually set, then ant release will actually do a debug build, rather than a release build.
