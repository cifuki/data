Q:I have added a 2.45mb jar file to my Android eclipse project and now I continue to get "Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: Java heap space" no matter what I do. 

I have researched online, and was informed to update my eclipse.ini to increase my Java VM heapsizes. I have done this for all the values in eclipse.ini and I continue to get the build error.

Any ideas?

A:Modify the -XmsAm and -XmxBm paremeters in eclipse.ini so that they are large enough. The default is -Xms40m -Xmx384m. Try changing them both to -Xms512m -Xmx512m and restart eclipse to see if that helps. If not, continue to increase the values and restart eclipse until either one of two things happens:


Your build completes.
Eclipse won't restart because you don't have enough memory.


eclipse.ini is located at /etc/eclipse.ini in Ubuntu (assuming you installed Eclipse from the Ubuntu repositories).

For MAC please see:


  Finding eclipse.ini is a wee bit tricky. To locate it, right-click on the Eclipse Application icon and select "Show Package Contents", then double-click on the "Contents" folder and then double-click on the "MacOS" folder, the home of eclipse.ini
