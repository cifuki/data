Q:After upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3 I see this warning



and when I try to compile the project I see this compilation error



How can i solve this issue without downgrading to a previous gradle version? 
Is there any update of android-apt that can solve this issue?

A:The android-apt plugin has been deprecated.
Check here for the migration guide:


  As of the Android Gradle plugin version 2.2, all functionality that was previously provided by android-apt is now available in the Android plugin.


You can remove android-apt by following the migration guide to get the equivalent functionalities.

The important parts from the migration guide:


  
  Make sure you are on the Android Gradle 2.2 plugin or newer.
  Remove the android-apt plugin from your build scripts
  Change all apt, androidTestApt and testApt dependencies to their new format:
  


dependencies {
   compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.0'
   annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.0'
}


Also in the Android Gradle plugin there is an explicit check for this, which is what you are seeing:


  using incompatible plugins for the annotation processing android-apt


Future Android Gradle plugin versions will not be compatible with the way android-apt works, which is the reason for that check.
