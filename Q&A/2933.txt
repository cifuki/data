Q:I am developing an application which will send a request to a bluetooth printer for printing. The code is working fine for real devices, but I want to run it on the Android Emulator. How can I use the emulator for bluetooth testing?

A:You can't. The emulator does not support Bluetooth, as mentioned in the SDK's docs and several other places. Android emulator does not have bluetooth capabilities". 

You can only use real devices.
