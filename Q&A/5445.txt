I am trying to install my project on 5 AVD's at the same time, but I constantly get this error, I am executing it on Windows 8.1

"* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
ADB server didn't ACK
* failed to start daemon *
error: cannot connect to daemon"


I have tried reading all possible posts on stackoverflow concerning this error, and all of them just mention that try to kill the adb process and restart eclipse and then all will be fine. I have tried the method mentioned in the posts and along with that I have also turned off my security and firewall, so that there is no obstruction on the port 5037. Somebody please help me as I need to execute my project and I am not able to do so :(. For your reference I can provide the output of the following command "netstat -ano | findstr "5037""

Somebody please suggest a workaround this problem, what might be the cause of this. Also you can take a look at the following image to infer what might be happening.

A:Try the following:


Close Eclipse.
Restart your phone.
End adb.exe process in Task Manager (Windows). In Mac, force close in Activity Monitor.
Issue kill and start command in \\platform-tools\\

C:\\sdk\\platform-tools>adb kill-server
C:\\sdk\\platform-tools>adb start-server

If it says something like 'started successfully', you are good.
