Q:I need to create a login form with 'username' 'password' fields and two buttons 'login' and 'cancel' in my android application. 

I am using an alert dialog with edittext inside that. 

This is the code I used to create password edittext..

     final EditText Password = new EditText(this);
     Password.setGravity(Gravity.CENTER);
     Password.setHint("Password");
     Password.setWidth(200);

     Password.setTransformationMethod(new PasswordTransformationMethod());
     login_alert.addView(Password);


My issue is that, plain text is shown instead of 'dots' when i open a softkeypad to edit the password. (It is shown as dots when not in softkeypad mode)

Can anyone suggest a solution?

A:Password.setInputType(InputType.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT | InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_PASSWORD);


This one works for me.
But you have to look at Octavian Damiean's comment, he's right.
