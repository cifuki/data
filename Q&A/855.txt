Q:Is there a native android way to get a reference to the currently running Activity from a service?

I have a service running on the background, and I would like to update my current Activity when an event occurs (in the service). Is there a easy way to do that (like the one I suggested above)?

You may not own the "currently running Activity".

Send a broadcast Intent to the activity -- here is a sample project demonstrating this pattern
Have the activity supply a PendingIntent (e.g., via createPendingResult()) that the service invokes
Have the activity register a callback or listener object with the service via bindService(), and have the service call an event method on that callback/listener object
Send an ordered broadcast Intent to the activity, with a low-priority BroadcastReceiver as backup (to raise a Notification if the activity is not on-screen) -- here is a blog post with more on this pattern
