Q:I need the exact duration of LENGTH_LONG and LENGTH_SHORT in milliseconds (ms). Also I need to know if the duration of Toast message with LENGTH_LONG will have the same duration in any phone and with any API version.

Does someone know where is the duration defined ?, I mean defined in ms . I know that LENGTH_LONG is some int const with value 1. But I could not find where is the actual duration defined.

A:Answered here. Like you mentioned Toast.LENGTH_SHORT and Toast.LENGTH_LONG are not in ms but 0 or 1.

The actual durations are:

private static final int LONG_DELAY = 3500; // 3.5 seconds
private static final int SHORT_DELAY = 2000; // 2 seconds
