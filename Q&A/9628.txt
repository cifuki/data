A:An expandable Notification is a special case of a Notification Big View. If the Big View is not at the top of the notification drawer, it it shown 'closed' and is expandable by swipe. Quote from Android Developers:


  A notification's big view appears only when the notification is expanded, which happens when the notification is at the top of the notification drawer, or when the user expands the notification with a gesture. Expanded notifications are available starting with Android 4.1.


The Big View Notification can be created as follows:

Notification notification = new Notification.BigTextStyle(builder)
.bigText(myText).build();


or

Notification notification = new Notification.BigPictureStyle(builder)
.bigPicture(
  BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),
    R.drawable.my_picture)).build();


Here is a tutorial.
