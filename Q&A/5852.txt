Q:I was using the <input type="file"> on the android webview.
I got it working thanks to this thread: 
File Upload in WebView

But the accepted answer (or any other) no longer works with android 4.4 kitkat webview.

Anybody knows how to fix it? 

It doesn't work with target 18 either.

I've looking some android 4.4 source code and it seems that the WebChromeClient hasn't changed, but I think the setWebChromeClient no longer works on the kitkat webview, or at least not the openFileChooser function.

A:Update 2:
There is a simpler plugin to use with phonegap/cordova

https://github.com/MaginSoft/MFileChooser

Update:
Sample project with Cesidio DiBenedetto plugin

I opened an issue on the android open source project and the answer was:


  Status:   WorkingAsIntended
  
  unfortunately, openFileChooser is not a public API. We are working on a public API in future releases of Android.


For those using phonegap/cordova, this workaround was posted on the bug tracker:

  Hey all, I've been experiencing this issue as well so I wrote a
  Cordova FileChooser plugin to a "band-aid" for the time being.
  Basically, in Android 4.4(KitKat), as mentioned in previous comments,
  the file dialog is not opened. However the onclick event is still
  fired on  so you can call the FileChooser plugin to
  open a file dialog and upon selection, you can set a variable that
  contains the full path to the file. At this point, you can use the
  FileTransfer plugin to upload to your server and hook into the
  onprogress event to show progress. This plugin is mainly configured
  for Android 4.4 so I would recommend to continue to use the native
  file dialogs for earlier versions of Android. There might be issues
  with the plugin as I have not fully tested all possible scenarios on
  many devices, but I have installed it on a Nexus 5 and it worked fine.

Not tested it because I built my own workaround

A comment form a chromium developer


  We will be a adding a public API to WebViewClient in next major
  release to handle file requests.


It seems they consider it as a bug now and they are going to fix it
