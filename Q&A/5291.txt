Q:I'm trying to install a platform but when I open Android Manager then I click Available Software then select the
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/repository.xml repository

I get this error:


  Failed to fetch URL https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/repository.xml


I have also tried downloading by clicking on force "http:" for all "https:" downloads on settings panel but it still doesn't help.

I'm working on Windows Vista.

A:If you enter the URL in a browser and then look at the source code of the page you will see that an  XML document is returned.

The reason why that URL would work in a browser but not in the android manager might be that you are required to specify a proxy server. In Eclipse (3.5.2) the proxy settings can be found here: "Window" -> "Preferences" -> "General" -> "Network Connections"
