Q:I have integrated firebase auth with my android app. Lets say a user has a mail abc@abc.com. I want to add some extra information to the user like the name of the user, occupation and address. How can i connect the user auth table with my android app to do that? 

Do i need to write any APIs for that?

A:First, create a users directory in db. Then, using user's unique id you get from authn process, store the user info under users/{userid}.

To achieve this, you need to get into the details of Firebase database. See here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/save-data
