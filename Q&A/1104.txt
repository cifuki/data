Q:Trying to install my own app from play store, it says "You cannot install this app because another user has already installed an incompatible version on this device"

Note - I've uninstalled the debug version, and also cleared my Cache. Still can't get it to install from Play Store.

My phone is not rooted, so as another similar answer here on stackoverflow suggests, I cannot use a root file explorer to clear data.

A:Refer this ,
Actually your debug version of the app didnt get uninstalled properly 


Go to settings > apps > downloaded app list
You can see the installed applications in the list
(the application may not be in order. or may be towards the very end)
Click on the application,go to the overflow menu option
Click on uninstall for all users options
