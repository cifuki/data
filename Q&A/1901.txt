Q:I am trying to get adb to see my Samsung Fascinate phone so that I can install my Android apps via usb to the phone. I am using osx 10.6.7. 

When I run "adb devices" it does not list my device and "adb usb" says "device not found". 

USB debugging is enabled and I have tried connecting in storage mode as well as media mode. When I am in storage mode I can see the phone's drive in Finder so I know that the usb connection works, however adb still can't find it. 

I read that for Mac there are no usb drivers, that it's just supposed to work, but this doesn't seem to be the case.

Any suggestions?

A:I have a Samsung Galaxy and I had the same issue as you. Here's how to fix it:

In device manager on your Windows PC, even though it might say the USB drivers are installed correctly, there may exist corruption.

I went into device manager and uninstalled SAMSUNG Android USB Composite Device and made sure to check the box 'delete driver software'.   Now the device will have an exclamation mark etc. I right clicked and installed the driver again (refresh copy). This finally made adb acknowledge my phone as an emulator.

As others noted, for Nexus 4, you can also try this fix.
