Q:I am trying to develop my first react-native Android app. When I run 

sudo react-native run-android


I get the following error

JS server already running.
Building and installing the app on the device (cd android && ./gradlew installDebug)...

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> failed to find target with hash string 'android-23' in: /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk

* Try:

BUILD FAILED

Total time: 4.981 secs
Could not install the app on the device, see the error above.


I have 24.3.3 under /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk with all API-23 packages installed



My android/app/build.gradle says

compileSdkVersion 23
buildToolsVersion "23.0.0"

defaultConfig {
    applicationId "com.awesomeandroid"
    minSdkVersion 16
    targetSdkVersion 23
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
    ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "x86"
    }
}


When I try $ANDROID_HOME, it says -bash: /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.3.3: is a directory.

I have also added local.properties under android/app/ and added sdk.dir=/usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.3.3

Am I missing something?

A:You need to point ANDROID_HOME to the parent directory of platforms and platform-tools so /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk
