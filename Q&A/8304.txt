Q:I have a fragment attached to the activity using XML (and setContentView() in activity). A have a problem because I have very dynamic views in my fragment, so when orientation changes 
I must restore all states of views. 

I have problem because I'm using something like that:

public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
        super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
        outState.putBoolean("restore", true);
        outState.putInt("nAndroids", 2);
   }


But after orientation change when methods with param Bundle savedInstanceState are called (like onCreateView etc) my savedInstanceState is always null. 

I'm not a noob in the Android but now I'm very angry because of this problem...

public void onViewCreated(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);

    if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        //smth
    } else {
        // smthelse THIS IS NEVER REACHED BECAUSE BUNDLE IS ALWAYS NULL
    }

    getListView().setDivider(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.list_divider));
}

A:All the problem was in that I don't declare android:id for the fragment in XML. Android needs ID or TAG to recognize stored fragment and reproduce all elements in it. So guys, remember - every instance of fragment needs unique id or tag!

Also, when setRetainInstance(true) is declared then bundle should always return null.
