Q:I have an android Library that outputs an aar library. This library will be built into different projectFlavors of Mobile, TV and Wear apps. I think that each of these platforms' should be the ones that set variables like the app name, icon, and permissions through the manifest and productflavors.

Is there any way to build an AAR without requiring an AndroidManifest.xml and therefore drawables(for the icon)?

More information about what I'm doing can be found at my last question on the subject:
Android Studio Java Library Module vs. Android Library Module

A:Any android library needs to have an AndroidManifest.xml file, but a name or an icon is not required. It's only needed when there is an activity that is MAIN and LAUNCHER.

You simply could use this manifest and your library will work like a charm.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="[your package]"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0" >

    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="[min supported version]" />

    <application/>

</manifest>
