Q:http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html

According to this doc, it doesn't say if it is possible to implement drawer from right hand side. Is it even possible? :(

A:Here is the documentation on the drawer and it appears that you can configure it to pull out from the left or right.


  Drawer positioning and layout is controlled using the
  android:layout_gravity attribute on child views corresponding to which
  side of the view you want the drawer to emerge from: left or right.
  (Or start/end on platform versions that support layout direction.)
