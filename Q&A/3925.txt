A:adb shell
am start -n com.package.name/com.package.name.ActivityName


Or you can use this directly:

adb shell am start -n com.package.name/com.package.name.ActivityName


You can also specify actions to be filter by your intent-filters:

am start -a com.example.ACTION_NAME -n com.package.name/com.package.name.ActivityName
