Q:I have a large app in android.

From time to time the application crashes with an error not clear. I do not know exactly when and why this happens.

java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: get/set setting for user asks
to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires 
android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL


Any help?

Add this android:protectionLevel="signature" in your manifest . 

For more details, you can check Permission-Element

Like:

<permission android:name="android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL" android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
