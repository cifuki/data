Q:I want some unique ID of the Android device. I've tried it with the following code

String ts = Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE;
TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) this.getSystemService(ts);


However I know that this works only for phones.

What if my app is running on some notebook, netbook or other type of device? How do I get an unique ID in that case?

A:Look at the constant
ANDROID_ID  in android.provider.Secure.Settings to see if that helps.

I am adding a few useful links from official docs;
