Q:I have an ImageButton that I want to fill its parent RelativeLayout container for its width but minus a few dp so it has some left and right padding. I tried fill_parent-10dp but that causes an error and doesn't render.

A:Put a android:layout_margin="10dp" on the ImageButton, along with the 

android:layout_width="fill_parent"
android:layout_height="fill_parent"
