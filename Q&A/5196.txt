A:It seems that someone asked this into Graphic Design: link here.

The accepted answer will lead you to the author site which is what i was looking for (a tool which generate your palette for you, GG to him!).

Also, the answer with the highest vote explain very well how palette are made, IMHO.

Both of them satisfied my curiosity.
