Q:I have checked my app build.gradle file and these are the only lines that are related to firebase in them 

/***
 * Firebase
 */
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-core:15.0.0'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:15.0.0'
implementation('com.crashlytics.sdk.android:crashlytics:2.9.1@aar') {
    transitive = true
}
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-ads:15.0.0'


I do not have any library that makes use of firebase so I don't think there can be an issue with a library using an older version.

The problem is I can't build gradle, clean project or rebuild project with the new v15 version of firebase as it keeps throwing the error All firebase libraries must be either above or below 14.0.0

A:Turns out I forgot to change the version number for com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads, switched it to 15.0.0 and it worked.

Here's a blog by Google that provides more information.
