Q:I am trying to create the android emulator for Nexus 10 using latest ADT(21) and SDK tools. I have the following configuration for the Nexus 10 AVD:

Screen Size - 10 inches 
Resolution - 2560 X 1600 
Screen Size - xlarge Screen Density - Xhdpi 
Screen ratio - long
RAM - 1024


Let me know if this configuration is wrong. After creating the above Configuration I was able to create the AVD but couldn't load it. It only shows a black screen. What could be the problem here? 

I am Using Ubuntu 11.10.

A:I had the same issue. You can do one thing,

1) When you create AVD, make sure Use Host GPU option is checked.



It worked for me, in my Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2, and eclipse juno. 

EDIT : Sorry folks for  the confusion. There is no Google Nexus 10 skin (at the time of writing this). What you see in the image is a Nexus 10 equalant I created using Device Definition (AVD manager 2nd tab) feature of eclipse. It is just I named it as Nexus 10 and it is not default google emulator.
