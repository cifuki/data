Q:I installed Android Studio but it was giving me error that I need to install JDK but JDK was already installed. Then I realized it is asking to install 64bit version of JDK.  

Anyway I just downloaded latest JDK 64bit version and set the following in Environment Variable but still Android Studio is giving error:

Error

'tools.jar' seems to be not in Android Studio classpath.  
Please ensure JAVA_HOME points to JDK rather than JRE.


Following paths are set in my Windows 8.

Path in User Variables  
E:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25\\bin

JAVA_HOME in System Variables  
E:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25

Path in System Variables  
E:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25\\bin


32bit JDK is installed on C drive while 64bit JDK is installed on E drive (as shown above). 32 bit JDK is not being used in any User or System Variables.  

I have also restarted the PC.

How do I fix this issue?

A:I had this same problem and was able to fix it after wasting about 3 hours:

Just copy tools.jar from %JAVA_HOME%\\lib to (Android Studio Root)\\lib
