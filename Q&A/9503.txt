Q:https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client
I've read this article. And it says that I need to download and add the configuration file to my project. But they do not explain, why should I do this? Won't it work without adding the configuration file?

A:I am also working on multiple GCM-projects but still using Eclipse, Eclipse-ADT-plugin and the old project structure and I did not include this config-file into my projects. I also was confused at the beginning and hence tried it in a Android-Studio project using Gradle but the config file was not necessary either.

So R\xc3\xa9mond\xc2\xb4s answer might make sense but for me everything is working fine (including generating InstanceID-Token and also Topic-Messaging is working).

So in fact, it should work without adding the file and you do not need this file anyway.
