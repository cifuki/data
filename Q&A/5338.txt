Q:My button's layout_width set to match_parent.

In order to display multi lines on the button, I tried:


insert '\
' into the text on button 
set Singleline false set Maxlines to 2 or 3
convert html from Html.fromHtml


Nothing worked. '\
' showed up as a small square on the button while showing single line of text.

Does anybody have any idea why this is happening and how I can fix this? 

UPDATE: I just found out I was using custom button that has its own text drawing. That's the reason. Sorry for the confusion. I just punished myself by banging my head.

A:If you're trying to add a new line in a layout XML file:

Use &#10; (new line)

    android:text="Hi&#10;Hello"


If you're trying to add a new line in code, just use '\
', same as in any other text.

If you can't see the second line, it may be that your Button doesn't have enough height. IE, in my case, the layout containing the button had a fixed height that just happened to make my button perfectly display one line of text.
