Q:How do I retrieve all HTML content currently displayed in a WebView?

I found WebView.loadData() but I couldn't find the opposite equivalent (e.g. WebView.getData())

Please note that I am interested in retrieving that data for web pages that I have no control over (i.e. I cannot inject a Javascript function into those pages, so that that it would call a Javascript interface in WebView).

A:Unfortunately there is not easy way to do this.

See How do I get the web page contents from a WebView?

You could just make a HttpRequest to the same page as your WebView and get the response.
