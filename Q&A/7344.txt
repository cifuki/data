Q:I've been looking around, in vain, for some information on using a dependency injection container in Android development. Specifically, how to override the creation of an Activity in a way that will also work when coming back from being killed (for whatever reason).

Has anyone got any experience in this area?

A:It appears you can use Google Guice 2.0 with Android. You might also look into roboguice.  

Edit:

Spring is also now available for Android

Edit:
Roboguice is now deprecated.  You might try Toothpick as mentioned in the comments by the developer behind Toothpick.
