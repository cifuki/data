Q:In my java class I want to use a string resource from strings.xml.

for that I have to use like below,

getString(R.string.address)


if my class is an activity then its taking. But my class is a simple java class , how can I use there?

Is it possible?
Thank you

A:A class does not have a context and to use a string resource a context is needed. So just call the class from an activity and give a parameter context and within your class constructor just use that context to get the string resource.

In your custom class you need to import the R namespace for the project to get the resource Id. 

import com.myrandomapp.R;


Then to get the actual string 

context.getString(R.string.COOL_STRING)
