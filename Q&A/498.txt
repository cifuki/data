Q:When I try to run my application with in-app billing I am getting the error: "This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play. Check the help center for more information".

I have the billing permission already in the Manifest file and I have a signed .apk uploaded as a draft onto Google Play and I have also installed that same signed apk onto my phone.

Any help on how to solve this issue?

A:This error may be caused by several reasons.  

Here is the list of requirements for the Google IAB testing.

Prerequisites:


AndroidManifest must include "com.android.vending.BILLING" permission.
APK is built in release mode.
APK is signed with the release certificate(s). (Important: with "App Signing by Google Play" it only works if you download directly from GooglePlayStore!)
APK is uploaded to alpha/beta distribution channel (previously - as a draft) to the developer console at least once. (takes some time ~2h-24h).
IAB products are published and their status set to active.
Test account(s) is added in developer console.


Testing requirements:


Test APK has the same versionCode as the one uploaded to developer console.
Test APK is signed with the same certificate(s) as the one uploaded to dev.console.
Test account (not developer) - is the main account on the device. (Main account might be not necessary - according to @MinosL comment)
Test account is opted-in as a tester and it's linked to a valid payment method.  (@Kyone)


P.S: Debugging with release certificate: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15754187/1321401 (Thnx @dipp for the link)

P.P.S: Wanted to make this list for a long time already.

Thnx @zlgdev, @Kyone, @MinosL for updates
