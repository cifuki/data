Q:I'm writing a card game and need my cards to be different sizes in different circumstances. I am storing my images as bitmaps so that they can be quickly drawn and redrawn (for animation).

My problem is that no matter how I try and scale my images (whether through a matrix.postScale, a matrix.preScale, or a createScaledBitmap function) they always come out pixelated and blurry. I know that its the scaling thats causing the problem because the images look perfect when drawn without resizing. 

I have worked through every solution described in these two threads:
android quality of the images resized in runtime
quality problems when resizing an image at runtime

but still haven't gotten anywhere. 

I store my bitmaps (into a hashmap) with this code:

cardImages = new HashMap<Byte, Bitmap>();
cardImages.put(GameUtil.hearts_ace, BitmapFactory.decodeResource(r, R.drawable.hearts_ace));


and draw them with this method (in a Card class):

public void drawCard(Canvas c)
{
    //retrieve the cards image (if it doesn't already have one)
    if (image == null)
        image = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(GameUtil.cardImages.get(ID), 
            (int)(GameUtil.standardCardSize.X*scale), (int)(GameUtil.standardCardSize.Y*scale), false);

        //this code (non-scaled) looks perfect
        //image = GameUtil.cardImages.get(ID);

    matrix.reset();
    matrix.setTranslate(position.X, position.Y);

    //These methods make it look worse
    //matrix.preScale(1.3f, 1.3f);
    //matrix.postScale(1.3f, 1.3f);

    //This code makes absolutely no difference
    Paint drawPaint = new Paint();
    drawPaint.setAntiAlias(false);
    drawPaint.setFilterBitmap(false);
    drawPaint.setDither(true);

    c.drawBitmap(image, matrix, drawPaint);
}


Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

A:I had blury images on low screen resolutions until I disabled scaling on bitmap load from resources:

Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
    options.inScaled = false;
    Bitmap source = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(a.getResources(), path, options);
