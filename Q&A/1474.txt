Q:I used react-native init MyApp to initialise a new React Native app.
This created among others an Android project with the package com.myapp.

What's the best way to change this package name, for example to: com.mycompany.myapp?

I tried changing it in AndroidManifest.xml but it created other errors, so I'm assuming it's not the way.

Any idea?

A:I've changed project' subfolder name from: "android/app/src/main/java/MY/APP/OLD_ID/" to: "android/app/src/main/java/MY/APP/NEW_ID/"

Then manually switched the old and new package ids:

In:
android/app/src/main/java/MY/APP/NEW_ID/MainActivity.java:

package MY.APP.NEW_ID;


In android/app/src/main/java/MY/APP/NEW_ID/MainApplication.java:

package MY.APP.NEW_ID;


In android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

package="MY.APP.NEW_ID"


And in android/app/build.gradle:

applicationId "MY.APP.NEW_ID"


(Optional) In android/app/BUCK:

android_build_config(
  package="MY.APP.NEW_ID"
)
android_resource(
  package="MY.APP.NEW_ID"
)


Gradle' cleaning in the end (in /android folder):

./gradlew clean
