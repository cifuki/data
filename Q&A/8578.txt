Q:I had successfully imported a Module in my Application project in Android Studio.
Then I deleted or removed the module by following the below link:

How to delete a module in Android Studio

I also removed the project module from the dependencies of my build.gradle(app) file.

Now, When I need to again include the same module project in my Andorid Application, it doesn't allows me, and gives the Project already contains module with the same name error. 

I had check in my Project, Package, Android Structure but the project module which i need to Import and add as a Module Project is not there but still it say it already exist. 

Can anyone help me to overcome this issue.??

A:If somebody faces this issue, except removing the Folder containing the old module also remove from the settings.gradle file the line corresponding to the old module: include ':youroldmodule'. If you dont remove that line manually, 2 modules with the same name will appear when trying to add module dependency.
