Q:Might be a noob question but for the life of me I can't figure out how to uninstall an app from my Samsung Gear Live.

I need to uninstall the debug version so I know I have a fresh production version when I download it from the Google Play store.

A:I don't know if there is a user interface for this. The easiest way I've found is via adb:

adb uninstall [-k] <package> - remove this app package from the device
                               ('-k' means keep the data and cache directories)


So, for example:

adb uninstall com.example.testandroidwear




As both @WaynePiekarski and @Thoast83 have mentioned, if the Android Wear device is connected via Bluetooth instead of a direct USB connection (e.g. when testing with the Moto 360) then you need to use adb -s <device> <command> as instructed by Directing Commands to a Specific Emulator/Device Instance in the adb documentation.

In this case, it might be something like:

adb -s localhost:4444 uninstall com.example.testandroidwear


provided you have established the connection exactly as described in Debugging over Bluetooth (otherwise, adjust the port number accordingly).
