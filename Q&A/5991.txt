Q:I have an app, with Push notifications implemented.

I want to understand the reason why we need "GET_ACCOUNTS"(android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS), while implementing GCM? Some users are raising concerns with this permission. I have used this permission in the manifest as it was given in the official site here.

How safe is this permission? and if I remove this, from my manifest, will the push notifications work?

A:It uses an existing connection for Google services. For pre-3.0
  devices, this requires users to set up their Google account on their
  mobile devices. A Google account is not a requirement on devices
  running Android 4.0.4 or higher.


SO this is the reason for requirement of the permission

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />


to read Google account.

Google account login is no longer needed for GCM to work. So you no need the android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS permission.

If you are using GCM API with GoogleCloudMessaging.register), you no longer need to configure Google account on any Android version. But if you are using the deprecated library (GCMRegistrar.register), you still need a Google Account on older versions (before ICS).
