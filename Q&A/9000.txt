Q:Which one is faster way to load mobile web pages and non mobile web pages in Android webview; loading cache or not loading that at all?

And what is recommend style to load that?

Right now when I don't load cache at all non mobile sites are much more slower to load than when I load them in native browser.

A:Don't use these:

viewer.getSettings().setAppCacheMaxSize(1024*1024*8);   
viewer.getSettings().setAppCachePath("/data/data/com.your.package.appname/cache"\xe2\x80\x8c\xe2\x80\x8b);    
viewer.getSettings().setAppCacheEnabled(true);   


These have nothing to do with the default webview internal cache. Appcache is an entirely different feature mean to make you able to run the website w/o an internet connection. It does not work that great and probably you do not want to use it.

With setting this: viewer.getSettings().setCacheMode(WebSettings.LOAD_DEFAULT) is enough.
