Q:I have many .mp3 files stored in res/raw folder.

I am getting URI of .mp3 file using following code.

Uri.parse("android.resource:///com.my.android.sharesound/"+resId);


This returns : android.resource:///com.my.android.sharesound/2130968609

Now I am using this URI in creating Share Intent

    shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM,Uri.parse("android.resource://com.my.android.sharesound/"+resId));
    startActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent,"Share Sound");


When i select any Mail application eg. Gmail or YahooMail from the Share Intent, the mp3 file attached successfully. But it shows that 2130968609(as an attachment)

i dont want resourceId(2130968609) to appear. 

I want to display fileName.mp3

How can i do that? Am i missing something ?

OR

Is there any other way to attach .mp3 file stored in res/raw to mail via Share Intent.

A:Finally after searching a lot i found the solution.

If you want to get any resource URI then there are two ways :


Using Resource Name

Syntax  : android.resource://[package]/[res type]/[res name]

Example :  Uri.parse("android.resource://com.my.package/drawable/icon");
Using Resource Id

Syntax  : android.resource://[package]/[resource_id]

Example : Uri.parse("android.resource://com.my.package/" + R.drawable.icon);


This were the examples to get the URI of any image file stored in drawable folder.

Similarly you can get URIs of res/raw folder.

In my case i used 1st way ie. Using Resource Name
