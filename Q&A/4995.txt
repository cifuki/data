Q:I would like to retrieve the name of a contact associated with an incoming telephone number. As I process the incoming number in the broascastreceiver having a String with the name of the incoming caller would help my project greatly.

I would think this involves a query using the sql WHERE clause as a filter, but do I need to sort the contacts? An example or hint would be of great assistance.

A:For that you need to use the optimized PhoneLookup provider as described.

Add the permission to AndroidManifest.xml:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"/>


Then:

public String getContactName(final String phoneNumber, Context context)
{
    Uri uri=Uri.withAppendedPath(ContactsContract.PhoneLookup.CONTENT_FILTER_URI,Uri.encode(phoneNumber));

    String[] projection = new String[]{ContactsContract.PhoneLookup.DISPLAY_NAME};

    String contactName="";
    Cursor cursor=context.getContentResolver().query(uri,projection,null,null,null);

    if (cursor != null) {
        if(cursor.moveToFirst()) {
            contactName=cursor.getString(0);
        }
        cursor.close();
    }

    return contactName;
}
