Q:I want to make my activity full screen with status bar on top of it  like this picture:



I have used this code in manifest inside activity tag:

'android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"'


But my view doesn't start from the status bar & it looks like this:



How can I make my activity look like the first one?

A:I know that the guy asking the question may have found his own solution but for the people who are still looking for a solution this is a very simple solution but one thing it has a limitation till Kitkat so a condition is added

if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {

    getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_LAYOUT_NO_LIMITS,
                      WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_LAYOUT_NO_LIMITS);
}
