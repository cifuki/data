Q:Say I'm developing a different layout for devices with screen size equal to or greater than 600dp.
I want to use the post android 3.2 resource qualifiers. I created a folder named layout-sw600dp and put my layout there, but at the same time I could have created a folder named layout-w600dp and put the layout xml file there. 
I'm trying to figure out what is the difference between -sw600dp and -w600dp? After all they are both meant to use the layout for device of width >=  600dp.

A:sw is "smallest width". It doesn't change if the device is rotated.

w, on the other hand, is available (i.e. current) width.

See Providing Alternative Resources:


  smallestWidth - sw<N>dp - The smallestWidth is a fixed screen size characteristic of the device;
  the device's smallestWidth does not change when the screen's
  orientation changes.
  
  Available width -   w<N>dp -  This configuration value will change when the orientation changes between landscape and portrait to match
  the current actual width.


Example. Say that you have a device that is 600dp x 400dp.


If you have a w600dp resource, it will be used in landscape, but not in portrait.
If you have a sw600dp resource, it will not be used for any orientation (smallest is 400).
