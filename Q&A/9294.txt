Q:I'm using phonegap facebook connect plugin (https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin) for Facebook Authentication in app. It was working till today morning. Now suddenly it stops working and gives error as below for different devices iOS & Android:

For Android:


  You are not logged in. You are not logged in. Please log in and try again.


For iOS:


  Given URL is not allowed by the application configuration: One or more of the given URL is not allowed by the App\xe2\x80\x99s settings. To use this URL you must add a valid native platform in your App\xe2\x80\x99s settings


I'm using following code in config.xml:

<gap:plugin name="com.phonegap.plugins.facebookconnect" version="0.9.0">    
     <param name="APP_ID" value="99885XXXXXXXXX" />
     <param name="APP_NAME" value="Test App" />
</gap:plugin>


facebook call:

function fbLogin() {
        facebookConnectPlugin.login(
        ["public_profile", "email"],
        function (response) {
            var OAuthToken = response.authResponse.accessToken;
            var OAuthAccessToken = response.authResponse.userID;
            if (response.authResponse) {
                facebookConnectPlugin.api('/me', null,
                    function (me_response) {
                        alert("Success: " + me_response);
                        facebookConnectPlugin.logout(function (response) {}, function (response) {});                            
                    });
            }                
        },
        function (response) {                
            alert("Error: " + me_response);
        }
    );
}


Don't know what is the issue here.

A:I had the exact same problem which popped up last few days or so. I fixed it by generating the respective platforms in the app's settings. Note that I only had the general settings before and it worked, but something probably been changed recently.


Go to he settings section of your app in Facebook (Facebook developers > My Apps then Settings)
Under the Basics make sure you have the respective platform. If you do and it is still not working, then remove and recreate it. Otherwise, click on [+ Add Platform] and follow the instructions. For example, for Android you need to provide:
a) Your package id
b) Your launcher activity full name
c) Key hash - which you need to generate as per instructions using keytool and openssl


good luck!
