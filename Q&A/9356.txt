Q:I have the following code for Android which works fine to play a sound once a button is clicked:

Button SoundButton2 = (Button)findViewById(R.id.sound2);
        SoundButton2.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

    public void onClick(View v) {
        mSoundManager.playSound(2);

    }
});


My problem is that I want the sound to play immediately upon pressing the button (touch down), not when it is released (touch up). Any ideas on how I can accomplish this?

A:Maybe using a OnTouchListener? I guess MotionEvent will have some methods for registering a touch on the object.

   button.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() {

    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
     // TODO Auto-generated method stub
     return false;
    }
   }))
