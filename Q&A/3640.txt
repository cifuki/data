Q:Ideally navigation drawer should get closed once some item has been pressed from it, but its not happening automatically. How to do it ?
Thanks!

A:Got it!

private DrawerLayout mDrawerLayout;
mDrawerLayout = (DrawerLayout) findViewById(R.id.drawer_layout);
mDrawerLayout.closeDrawers();


Working perfectly fine.
