Q:I have recently updated to the google play services library version 9.0.0, and I keep getting the following logcat message:

05-19 23:07:30.023 19237-19508/? V/GoogleSignatureVerifier: options.developer.com.developeroptions signature not valid.  Found: 


While my app isn't using the google maps api but it is using the analytics, ads, and google plus apis.

The only mention in the documentation regarding the usage of the api key is when using google maps, or android places api.

I have also tried adding the 'com.google.android.geo.API_KEY' with a correct key but it didn't help.

here is my gradle.build file:

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 23
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.3"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "options.developer.com.developeroptions"
        minSdkVersion 9
        targetSdkVersion 23
        versionCode 23
        versionName "1.06"
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}


dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-plus:9.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.2.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:9.0.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:9.0.0'
}

A:Sorry, thats a bug! It's just spurious logging though: Google Play services does some checking to see whether you are a Google app or a regular third party one. 

As part of that, it calls the signature verifier and the logging ended up more verbose than intended - it will be fixed in a future version.This shouldn't affect the behavior of your app at all.
