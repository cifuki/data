Q:I am using Retrofit and Robospice to make API calls in my android application. All @POST methods work great, and so do @GET commands without any parameters in the URL, but I can't get any @GET calls to work with parameters on the end! 

For example, if my API path was "my/api/call/" and I wanted 2 parameters "param1" and "param2" in the URL, the get call would look like:

http://www.example.com/my/api/call?param1=value1&param2=value2

so I have setup my @GET interface like so:

@GET("/my/api/call?param1={p1}&param2={p2}")
Response getMyThing(@Path("p1")
String param1, @Path("p2")
String param2);


but I get an error saying "An exception occurred during request network execution : URL query string "/my/api/call?param1={p1}&param2={p2}" on method getMyThing may not have replaced block."

What am I doing wrong?

A:You should be using this syntax:

@GET("/my/API/call")
Response getMyThing(
    @Query("param1") String param1,
    @Query("param2") String param2);


Specifying query parameters in the URL is only for when you know both the key and value and they are fixed.
