Q:So I am trying to use Retrofit for my project. As the site says I have included 
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:2.0.0-beta1' in build.gradle. I was reading the tutorials from this link . I want to do something similar like this 

final RestAdapter restadapter = new RestAdapter.Builder().setEndpoint("http://services.hanselandpetal.com").build();

        api flowerapi = restadapter.create(api.class);

        flowerapi.getData(new Callback<List<Flower>>() {
            @Override
            public void success(List<Flower> flowers, Response response) {
                flowerList = flowers;
                adapter adapt = new adapter(getApplicationContext(),R.layout.item_file,flowerList);
                //ListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.list);
                setListAdapter(adapt);
            }


in my project ie make some calls to an API. But restadapter just doesn't get resolved. On hovering on it it simply says symbol can't be resolved. What is happening here ?

A:You have two options:

1) Use stable Retrofit 1

This has the RestAdapter class you need.

compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:1.9.0'


2) Migrate to Retrofit 2

The RestAdapter class was renamed to Retrofit and the API was completely remade. Read more in Jake Wharton's presentation.

compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:2.0.0-beta1'

As of June 30 2016 the latest version is  2.1.0 obtained by

compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.1.0'
