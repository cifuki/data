Q:I have to design splash screens(images that fit screen while loading) for android application using phonegap. I have to design 4 size images that fit for 4types of screens like ldpi, mdpi , hdpi, xhdpi . Can anyone tell me exact sizes in pixels for these screens so I can design in that size ?

Example answer : 

ldpi - 1024X768 px
mdpi  - 111 X 156 px  

 We support ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi displays; the following will define splash screens for each specific screen type.

<gap:splash src="splash/android/ldpi.png" gap:platform="android" gap:density="ldpi" />
<gap:splash src="splash/android/mdpi.png" gap:platform="android" gap:density="mdpi" />
<gap:splash src="splash/android/hdpi.png" gap:platform="android" gap:density="hdpi" />
<gap:splash src="splash/android/xhdpi.png" gap:platform="android" gap:density="xhdpi" />

A:There can be any number of different screen sizes due to Android having no set standard size so as a guide you can use the minimum screen sizes, which are provided by Google. 

According to Google's statistics the majority of ldpi displays are small screens and the majority of mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi and xxhdpi displays are normal sized screens.


xlarge screens are at least 960dp x 720dp 
large screens are at least 640dp x 480dp 
normal screens are at least 470dp x 320dp
small screens are at least 426dp x 320dp


You can view the statistics on the relative sizes of devices on Google's dashboard which is available here.

More information on multiple screens can be found here.

9 Patch image

The best solution is to create a nine-patch image so that the image's border can stretch to fit the size of the screen without affecting the static area of the image.
