Q:from what I understand, Android Studio is supposed to show the whole matrix of build variants and flavors in the "Build Variants" panel.

I've created an empty project, with the following build.gradle.

  buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.6.+'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'android'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion 17
    buildToolsVersion "18.1.0"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 7
        targetSdkVersion 18
    }

    productFlavors {
        productFlavors {
            flavor1 {
                packageName "com.example.flavor1"
                versionCode 20
            }

            flavor2 {
                packageName "com.example.flavor2"
                minSdkVersion 14
            }
        }    }

}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+'
}


Even so, I only get "Debug" and "Release" as build variants, not the expected "Debugflavor1", "Debugflavor2", etc. Any ideas why this is happening? Is my assumption about the ability to include flavors wrong? If so, how can one build a flavor in Android Studio?

UPDATE, SOLVED: See first comment. You need to manually sync project with the gradle files via "Tools" - "Android" - "sync .."

A:You need to update your project with your gradle changes.  In the latest version of Android Studio (currently version 3.1.1) you would accomplish this with:

File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files
