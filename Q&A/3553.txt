Q:I am using this call:

Secure.getString(getApplicationContext().getContentResolver(), Secure.ANDROID_ID);


To get a UID for the device. I think I am getting the same ID from multiple devices though. Should this be possible? 

The ID in question is: 9774d56d682e549c and apparently there is an issue with several devices returning this ID http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/list?cursor=10603&updated=10603&ts=1295993403

A:Check into this thread,.  However you should be careful as it's documented as "can change upon factory reset". Use at your own risk, and it can be easily changed on a rooted phone.  Also it appears as if some manufacturers have had issues with their phones having duplicate numbers thread.  Depending on what your trying to do, I probably wouldnt use this as a UID.
