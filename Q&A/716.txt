I installed the latest versions of SDK (API 16) and got the latest ADT. I'm now seeing these messages in the logcat, that I'm quite sure, I haven't seen before. Does anyone have an idea about this?


  06-29 23:11:17.796: I/Choreographer(691): Skipped 647 frames!  The
  application may be doing too much work on its main thread.


I did a search and found this link:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Choreographer.html. This is a new class introduced in API 16.

I need to know how I can determine what "too much work" my application may be doing as all my processing is done in AsyncTasks.

A:Choreographer lets apps to connect themselves to the vsync, and properly time things to improve performance.

Android view animations internally uses Choreographer for the same purpose: to properly time the animations and possibly improve performance.

Since Choreographer is told about every vsync events, I can tell if one of the Runnables passed along by the Choreographer.post* apis doesnt finish in one frame's time, causing frames to be skipped.

In my understanding Choreographer can only detect the frame skipping. It has no way of telling why this happens.

The message "The application may be doing too much work on its main thread." could be misleading.
