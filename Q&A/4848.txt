Q:This question is in continuation to Should I choose Boost Asio or Aysnc Socket threads in Android? asked,

Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad range of applications, but yet there is no official support available for Android and iOS


Is there any specific reason behind the same like Not optimized for
embedded devices? Or any other reason?
Does any body know of any application built using Boost on Android or iOS?
Is it advisable to use boost libraries for network intense application which spawns   multple threads for commuication?


FYI..I have been using following links to create a sample Android application , but not successful yet :(

A:Got reply from boost community
Yes. These platforms are not officially supported because no one has
 volunteered to run regression tests regularly for them.

It is not possible for a Boost developer to test on all platforms. So
 developers depend on the test results of regression tests run by
 volunteers. For example, see
http://beta.boost.org/development/tests/trunk/developer/summary.html

If no one volunteers to run the tests for a particular platform, that
 platform is not officially supported.

So if you care about Android or iOS becoming officially supported,
 start running regular (preferably daily) regression tests for Boost.
 See http://beta.boost.org/development/running_regression_tests.html
