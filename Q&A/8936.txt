Q:\xe3\x80\x80

When my app starts, I'd like to hide the soft keys bar (in red rectangle) to have a larger screen.


How can I hide it?
Do I need to show the bar purposely when the app quits? Or it will restore itself automatically after the app quits?


Android 4.1, with no hardware keys on phone front.

A:Try

getWindow().getDecorView().setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION);


From official doc


  The SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE flag replaces the STATUS_BAR_HIDDEN
  flag. When set, this flag enables \xe2\x80\x9clow profile" mode for the system
  bar or navigation bar. Navigation buttons dim and other elements in
  the system bar also hide. Enabling this is useful for creating more
  immersive games without distraction for the system navigation buttons.
  
  The SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_VISIBLE flag replaces the STATUS_BAR_VISIBLE flag
  to request the system bar or navigation bar be visible.
  
  The SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION is a new flag that requests the
  navigation bar hide completely. Be aware that this works only for the
  navigation bar used by some handsets (it does not hide the system
  bar on tablets). The navigation bar returns to view as soon as the
  system receives user input. As such, this mode is useful primarily for
  video playback or other cases in which the whole screen is needed but
  user input is not required.


The behavior of the nav bar is app dependent IIRC, so it should show again after the user leaves your app.
