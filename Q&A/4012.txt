Q:I recently started to use Android Studio. It uses this style of braces by default: 

public void scanFile(String filePath) {

}


The code I need to submit requires to be styled as follows: 

public void scanFile(String filePath) 
{

}


Where can I find a setting for this?

A:You need to change the code style in Project Settings

File -> Settings -> (Project Settings) -> Code Style -> Java -> Wrapping and Brances


Change the Braces Placement for Class and Method declaration to Next Line

(Or, on a Mac, do the same thing in Preferences)
