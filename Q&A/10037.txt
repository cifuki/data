Q:In my Android project, I have a ListView with rows containing SwitchCompat items (AppCompat for Switch widget).

My problem occurs when I scroll into the list and getView(...) method of MyAdapter is invoked with a recycled view. I redefine the correct Switch state but the animation is visible.

There is a solution to prevent the animation in this case?

A:Call jumpDrawablesToCurrentState() to skip the animation

switchCompat.setChecked(true);
switchCompat.jumpDrawablesToCurrentState();
