Q:I want to send  the following JSON text 

{"Email":"aaa@tbbb.com","Password":"123456"}


to a web service and read the response. I know to how to read JSON. The problem is that the above JSON object must be sent in a variable name jason. 

How can I do this from android? What are the steps such as creating request object, setting content headers, etc.

A:Android doesn't have special code for sending and receiving HTTP, you can use standard Java code. I'd recommend using the Apache HTTP client, which comes with Android. Here's a snippet of code I used to send an HTTP POST.

I don't understand what sending the object in a variable named "jason" has to do with anything. If you're not sure what exactly the server wants, consider writing a test program to send various strings to the server until you know what format it needs to be in.

int TIMEOUT_MILLISEC = 10000;  // = 10 seconds
String postMessage="{}"; //HERE_YOUR_POST_STRING.
HttpParams httpParams = new BasicHttpParams();
HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(httpParams, TIMEOUT_MILLISEC);
HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(httpParams, TIMEOUT_MILLISEC);
HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient(httpParams);

HttpPost request = new HttpPost(serverUrl);
request.setEntity(new ByteArrayEntity(
    postMessage.toString().getBytes("UTF8")));
HttpResponse response = client.execute(request);
