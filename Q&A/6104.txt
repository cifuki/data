A:This is the hardware serial number. To access it on


Android 8 and later (>= SDK 26) use android.os.Build.getSerial() which requires the dangerous permission READ_PHONE_STATE. Using android.os.Build.SERIAL returns android.os.Build.UNKNOWN.
Android 7.1 and earlier (<= SDK 25) and earlier android.os.Build.SERIAL does return a valid serial.


It's unique for any device. If you are looking for possibilities on how to get/use a unique device id you should read here.

For a solution involving reflection without requiring a permission see this answer.
