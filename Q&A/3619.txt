Q:So I am newbie, and I was trying to implement the Email/Password Authentication using Firebase 9.0.0
So the activity perform either the register operation or the login operation.

The login operation is running smoothly and I can see updates on the Firebase Console.
But when I try to register a new user, this error occurs,

E/DynamiteModule: Failed to load module descriptor class: Didn't find class "com.google.android.gms.dynamite.descriptors.com.google.firebase.auth.ModuleDescri ptor" on path: DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/deventree.com.thetimothyinitiative- 2/base.apk"],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/vendor/lib, /system/lib]]


My device is running Google Play services version 9.0.83. 

Android Studio 2.1.1, with Google Play services SDK installed.
I have enabled sign in method in the console too.

Don't know what I'm missing!

A:Alfonso from the Firebase team. 

You can ignore the error E/DynamiteModule: Failed to load module descriptor class: Didn't find class "com.google.android.gms.dynamite.descriptors.com.google.firebase.auth.ModuleDescriptor": unfortunately there is a bug in Play Services where this is logged as E/ rather than debug. We will deploy the fix on the next release. 

This should not affect the behavior of your application, if you have an issue, look for the cause somewhere else.
