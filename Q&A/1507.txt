Q:I am using AutoCompleteTextView, when the user clicks on it, I want to show suggestions even if it has no text - but setThreshold(0) works exactly the same as setThreshold(1) - so the user has to enter at least 1 character to show the suggestions.

A:This is documented behavior: 


  When threshold is less than or equals 0, a threshold of 1 is
  applied.


You can manually show the drop-down via showDropDown(), so perhaps you can arrange to show it when you want. Or, subclass AutoCompleteTextView and override enoughToFilter(), returning true all of time.
