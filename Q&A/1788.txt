Q:How can I attach Android SDK sources to Android Studio? 

When I open one of the Android classes, the "Sources not found" window with "Attach Sources" option doesn't appear.

What is the other way to do this?

A:Open your sdk manager from toolbar menus and download the "Sources for Android SDK" for the API level defined in your build.gradle file like

compileSdkVersion 19 // compile with API level 19


Nothing else needs to be done.

Note : Sources for SDK is available only for API levels 14 and above.

UPDATE ( Based on stable release 3.2.1):

Google changes the approach of shipping the sources, so lets see what changed.

Go to the following location

Preferences -> Apperance & Behaviour -> System Settings -> Android SDK


Quite lazy to navigate type SDK in search and studio will help you to take to right place.



You can read the description, says mostly what to do.
So after clicking on "show package details" you will see whether sources are installed or not (as shown in below picture) if it is not installed do install and you are good.
