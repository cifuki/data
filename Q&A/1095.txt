Q:What I want to do, is to save an image to the internal memory of the phone (Not The SD Card).

How can I do it?

I have got the image directly from the camera to the image view in my app its all working fine.

Now what I want is to save this image from Image View to the Internal memory of my android device and also access it when required.

Can anyone please guide me how to do this?

I am a little new to android so please, I would appreciate if I can have a detailed procedure.

A:Use the below code to save the image to internal directory.

private String saveToInternalStorage(Bitmap bitmapImage){
        ContextWrapper cw = new ContextWrapper(getApplicationContext());
         // path to /data/data/yourapp/app_data/imageDir
        File directory = cw.getDir("imageDir", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
        // Create imageDir
        File mypath=new File(directory,"profile.jpg");

        FileOutputStream fos = null;
        try {           
            fos = new FileOutputStream(mypath);
       // Use the compress method on the BitMap object to write image to the OutputStream
            bitmapImage.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 100, fos);
        } catch (Exception e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            try {
              fos.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } 
        return directory.getAbsolutePath();
    }


Explanation : 

1.The Directory will be created with the given name. Javadocs is for to tell where exactly it will create the directory.

2.You will have to give the image name by which you want to save it.

To Read the file from internal memory. Use below code 

private void loadImageFromStorage(String path)
{

    try {
        File f=new File(path, "profile.jpg");
        Bitmap b = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(new FileInputStream(f));
            ImageView img=(ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imgPicker);
        img.setImageBitmap(b);
    } 
    catch (FileNotFoundException e) 
    {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

}
