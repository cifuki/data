Q:Edit/Solution: execute ./adb logcat in the platform-tools directory.



Original Question:

I know that there's a way to display the LogCat for an Android device/emulator in Terminal on my Mac, but I'm not sure what the command is.  This is mostly due to my incompetence with UNIX commands.  

Here are my previous failures:


  adb logcat
  adb.exe logcat
  FULL_PATH_TO_PLATFORM_TOOLS/adb logcat
  FULL_PATH_TO_PLATFORM_TOOLS/adb.exe logcat

A:Ah, just adb logcat should work. You may need to do an explicit path if the Android SDK tools directories aren't in your PATH, but that should do it.
