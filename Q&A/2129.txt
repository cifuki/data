Q:Somehow in my app many of the cordova plugins are installed and because of that it requires access to almost everything - from my contacts to current location ( even though this app doesn't need this ). 

This app is build via jenkins and as far as I understand one solution is to remove every plugin with single command, so it will be like:

cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.battery-status
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.camera
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.contacts
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.geolocation
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.media
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.media-capture
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.splashscreen
cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.vibration


But sometimes it shows some errors and with jenkins any error ends up with build failure, so is there any command which deletes all plugins? ( during installation basics plugins which requires any app to work are added automatically via cordova, so I was looking for some cordova plugin rm -all but couldn't find it )

A:First, you should list your plugins:

cordova plugin list


With this result, you can simply do:

cordova plugin remove <PLUGIN_NAME>


For example:

cordova plugin remove org.apache.cordova.media


Hope it helps.
