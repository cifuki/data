Q:I have a WebViewClient attached to my WebView like so:

webView.setWebViewClient(new MyWebViewClient());


Here is my implementation of MyWebViewClient:

private class MyWebViewClient extends WebViewClient {

    @Override
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
      webView.loadUrl(url);
      return true;
    }    
}


I give the WebView a URL to load via loadUrl(). If I have a link (a href...) in the page, my shouldOverrideUrlLoading method is called and I can intercept the link click.

However, if I have a form whose method is POST, the shouldOverrideUrlLoading method is not called.

I noticed a similar issue here: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9122 which seems to suggest overriding postUrl in my WebView.  However, this API is only available starting from API level 5.

What can I do if I'm on API level 4?  Is there any other way to intercept form posts?

A:This is known issue, that shouldOverrideUrlLoading don't catch POST. See http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9122 for details. 

Use GET! I personally tried using POST, because I expected some limitation of GET parameters (i.e. length of URL), but I just successfully passed 32000 bytes through GET locally without any problems.
