Q:I'm using IntelliJ Android-Studio 0.8.2 and i'd like to know if it's possible to open the code by default when editing XML files?

Opening multiple files always shows Design tab, while opening single files, though, it sometimes opens them in Text tab but sometimes not.

Is there any way to set the default tab to Text ? It's pretty annoying as I rarely use the Design tab. Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about:



Thanks in advance.
