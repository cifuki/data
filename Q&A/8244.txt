Q:I have been facing a IN - App Purchase problem since long time. i need to integrate In-App functionality in my Android Application, but When i upload APK file to play store, it does not allow me to add SKU values. To add in-app products, you need to add the BILLING permission to your APK
 I have been added  "com.android.vending.BILLING" permission in menifest file


1. I downloaded TRIVAL-DRIVER project.
2. Create a new library Project "BILLLING LIBRARY" with my Custom PackageName eg: Abc.xyz
3. Copy All UTLITY files ALONG .AIDL file[with default packagename com.android.vending.billing]in my new Project
4. Gave Reference of that "BILLING LIBRARY" project to MY APPLICATION.
5. Create a Signed APK fie and upload it to Play Store - [DRAFT]
6. When i go to Create SKU values, it gives me message "To add in-app products, you need to add the BILLING permission to your APK." and doesnt allow to add SKU values.


ANy Suggestion/ Tips would be appreciated

Thanks,
Salik

A:Have you added this line in your manifest file

<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
