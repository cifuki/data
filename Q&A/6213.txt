Q:In my strings.xml file I have 

<string name="continue">Continue</string>


I can't build my project because of the error: "Invalid symbol: 'continue'". Why I can't use such a name?

A:It's because continue is a reserved symbol in Java, so you cannot use it as a name for any object in your XML files or Java code.

The reason this is a problem is that the XML defined in your project is translated into Java code that the Dalvik VM can understand. So, your code above translates into the following in R.java:

public final class R {
    public static final class string {
        public static final int continue=0x7f040000;
    }
}


The problem is more obvious when examining the (would-be) generated code.

See list of reserved Java symbols for others to avoid.
