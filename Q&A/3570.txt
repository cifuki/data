Q:I have an Activity and many fragments inflated in same FrameLayout

<FrameLayout
    android:id="@+id/content_frame"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />


example: mainActivity > any fragment (press back button) > activity is blank.

In onCreate:

layout = (FrameLayout)findViewById(R.id.content_frame);
layout.setVisibility(View.GONE);


When I start a fragment:

FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
ft.replace(R.id.content_frame, profileFragment);
ft.addToBackStack(null);
ft.commit();
layout.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);


I suppose I need to make the frameLayout's visibility GONE again on back pressed, but how do I do this?



I tried onBackPressed and set layout.setVisibility(View.GONE); but I cannot go back through fragments, as I go directly to main page.

A:If you have more than one fragment been used in the activity or even if you have only one fragment then the first fragment should not have addToBackStack defined. Since this allows back navigation and prior to this fragment the empty activity layout will be displayed.

 // fragmentTransaction.addToBackStack() // dont include this for your first fragment.


But for the other fragment you need to have this defined otherwise the back will not navigate to earlier screen (fragment) instead the application might shutdown.
