Q:how can i capture the screenshot of an app using ddms from intellij Idea?

I have been using intellij for some time and i find it very useful.
though i couldnt find a way to make it work.

Could any one please tell me if this is possible from within the IDE itself?

A:UPDATE: Screen Capture feature was added in IntelliJ IDEA 13 (and Android Studio):
