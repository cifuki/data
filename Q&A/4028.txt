Q:Is there a simple way to do the Curl page flipping animation? A Curl animation is animation of pages flipping, including the page above rolling and the shadows over the lower page. 
What is the recommended way to do a "gallery" that displays two pages at a time (just like a book)?

Is it:


Letting the adapter display a linear layout of two images at a time? (it won't let me show a page flipping over the other like a book)
Using two pages, placing somehow one near the other, and then when it's time to animate -move the next two pages over?
What is the better way that would enable displaying the left page flipping over the right page?

A:I'm implementing a 2D page curl in the native canvas. Check my answer in: Implement page curl on android?
