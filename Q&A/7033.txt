Q:I'm using AndroidTestCase for unit testing. I have a unit test which is failing, but I haven't figured out how to display output from it. For example, I don't see the values I print using Log.d or System.out.println in the console nor the logcat output.

How do I view the unit test console?

A:You shoud see the Log.d() messages in logcat unless your test is crashing much before (i.e in the constructor).
