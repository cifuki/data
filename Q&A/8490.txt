Q:I have an image view and a string src. I want to set the imageview source to the string src that I  have, but am unable to do so beacuse the method expects an int:

imgview.setImageResource(int);


Since this method takes an int how can I accomplish my goal of using a string?

A:Each image has a resource-number, which is an integer. Pass this number to "setImageResource" and you should be ok.

Check this link for further information:

e.g.:

imageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.myimage);
