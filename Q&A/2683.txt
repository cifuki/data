Q:Is there a property to set for Android's LinearLayout that will enable it to properly wrap child controls?

Meaning - I have changeable number of children and would like to lay out them horizontally like:


Example: Control1, Control2, Control3, ...


I do that by setting:


ll.setOrientation(LinearLayout.HORIZONTAL);
foreach (Child c in children)
  ll.addView(c);


However, if I have large number of children, last one gets cuts off, instead of going to next line.

Any idea how this can be fixed?

A:As of May 2016 Google has created its own FlexBoxLayout which should solve your problem.

You can find the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout
