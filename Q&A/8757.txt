Q:Hi i want to implement the Chat application in android using XMPP (To
 avoid the GCM notifications because GCM uses request response
 process). 

i have done the 70 perc functionality using Smack library
 and OpenFire server. but after completion of these i came to know
 about the QuickBlox SDK. I don't know completely about that but few
 people are saying that it is good api by seeing the features..  

can any one tell me that is it correct way of implementing the chat
 application using smack for xmpp . or we have any other good api which
 uses xmpp for android .

A:The Stackoverflow question "Android and XMPP: Currently available solutions" provides a good overview of XMPP client libraries for Android.

Another good resource is xmpp.org/xmpp-software/libraries.
