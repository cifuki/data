Q:Okay, I recently started learning Java/Android so I look up a lot of tutorials and do a lot of copying/pasting, but most of the times the tutorial doesn't have the imports imported, so I have to go down the line clicking all the errors then Import this, import that, import something else! So... my question: Is there a way to import all of them at once?

A:On Windows you can use: Ctrl+shift+o   which is a shortcut to Organize imports

On Mac it is Command+Shift+O (Thanks orip)
