Q:I got this error on Android Studio (AS):


How I got it:

I created an AS Project from scratch and everything was fine.
Then a popup showed up, and (if I recall correctly) was saying something like: "Android Framework detected". I pressed "Yes' and some changes happened to the project/module. And after that I got the above error

Edit:

In my case the problem was not Gradle related. It had to do with IntelliJ/Android Studio configuration, an .iml file in particular.
I realized that after reading this informative post here.

A:On Android Studio v0.8.2 clicking on Sync project with Gradle files button solved my problem.



update

Thanks to the comment of jaumard. If the Sync project with Gradle files it's not visible you have to open the Gradle panel and click sync icon on top the toolbar.



Hope it helps :)
