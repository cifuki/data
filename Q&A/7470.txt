Q:I want my EditText should work as AutoComplete, for that I write in XML file

android:inputType="textAutoComplete|textAutoCorrect"


but it's not working. 

I am working with API v2.2 and my Activity extends MapActivity, there I put a simple EditText and a button named "Search". so if we type the location name in EditText and press search button means it should go to that location in map.
So I want that EditText to work as a AutoComplete.
How can I do that?

A:Just use an AutoCompleteTextView instead of normal EditText.
