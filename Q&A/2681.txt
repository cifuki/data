Q:Could someone tell me if it's possible to build only one of my different flavors through the command-line? 

At the moment I haven't seen the way to execute, for example:

gradle buildDev 


when Dev is one of my different flavors. Indeed, I have to execute:

gradle build


And all flavors are build. 

I'd like to skip some flavors. 
is it possible?

Thanks

A:While there is no flavor-specific version of the build task, there are flavor-specific versions of the assemble and install tasks. assemble will create the APK; install will install it on devices/emulators.

For example, in this sample project, I define two product flavors (chocolate and vanilla) and three total build types (debug, release, and mezzanine).

Running gradle tasks shows, among others:

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles all variants of all applications and secondary packages.
assembleChocolate - Assembles all builds for flavor Chocolate
assembleChocolateDebug - Assembles the Debug build for flavor Chocolate
assembleChocolateDebugTest - Assembles the Test build for the ChocolateDebug build

assembleChocolateRelease - Assembles the Release build for flavor Chocolate
assembleDebug - Assembles all Debug builds
assembleMezzanine - Assembles all Mezzanine builds
assembleRelease - Assembles all Release builds
assembleTest - Assembles all the Test applications
assembleVanilla - Assembles all builds for flavor Vanilla
assembleVanillaDebug - Assembles the Debug build for flavor Vanilla
assembleVanillaDebugTest - Assembles the Test build for the VanillaDebug build
assembleVanillaMezzanine - Assembles the Mezzanine build for flavor Vanilla
assembleVanillaRelease - Assembles the Release build for flavor Vanilla
