Q:I have added the 'gen' folder to svn:ignore, are there any others I should be ignoring?

Update:

There are some I am unsure about

.classpath
.project
The .settings folder


And also, to ignore a folder I am just typing gen into the ignore list in subclipse, is this correct?  How would it know if gen is a folder or file?

A:Just ignore gen and bin directories.
