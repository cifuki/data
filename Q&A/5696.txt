Q:I have an Android app that displays a comic book. To make use of the built-in zoom controls, I am loading the pictures in a WebView like so:

webView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/page1.jpg");


This is working just fine, however, since the images are in the assets folder, they are not being compressed which makes my .apk enormous. I was wondering how to reference resource files (from the res/drawable folder) with a file path like I did above with the assets. Does anyone know what that path would look like? I've tried things like "file:///res/drawable/pagetitle.jpg" with no success. Thanks for the help.



Update:

I found that "file:///android_res/drawable/page1.jpg" was the path that I was looking for.

A:from this site

Using the resource id, the format is:

"android.resource://[package]/[res id]"

Uri path = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.androidbook.samplevideo/" + R.raw.myvideo);


or, using the resource subdirectory (type) and resource name (filename without extension), the format is:

"android.resource://[package]/[res type]/[res name]"

Uri path = Uri.parse("android.resource://com.androidbook.samplevideo/raw/myvideo");
