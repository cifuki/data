Q:I'm interested in incorporating the Android UI pattern called "Quick Action". Basically, it's a context menu that doesn't cover up the data that is being acted on. I'd like to implement this but I cannot find some sample code or an API to help me out.

Note this UI pattern is discussed in the YouTube video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1ZBjlCRfz0#t=15m20s.

Does anyone have an implementation of this or know what Google's standard is for adding this to an application?

A:Till the official Twitter app is open sourced by Google, you may want to take a look at this implementation:

Really easy to use and works great.
