Q:I have a desktop application using git for synchronization. I have also an android application which do the same as the desktop, but I don't know how to do the synchronization part on it. I haven't found any implementation of git on android. I found a jgit, but its unwell documented and I was not able to do even a commit with that. 

I was thinking about remote commands to my git server from my android app, but this is really a tease for me. 
Could you tell me if any other git implementation which can be used on android exists? If you have any idea how to solve that, please tell me.

A:Another option is using ASE.  There seems to be a full-featured pure python implementation of git at https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich.
