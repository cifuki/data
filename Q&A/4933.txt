A:The tutorial Android Custom Navigation Drawer (via archive.org) contains a basic and a custom project. The latter shows how to setup a Navigation Drawer as shown in the screenshot:



The source code of the projects (via archive.org) is available for download.



The is also the Navigation Drawer - Live-O project ...



The source code of the project is available on GitHub.



The MaterialDrawer library aims to provide the easiest possible implementation of a navigation drawer for your application. It provides a great amount of out of the box customizations and also includes an easy to use header which can be used as AccountSwitcher.





Please note that Android Studio meanwhile has a template project to create a Navigation Drawer Activity as shown in the screenshot.



This repository keeps track of changes being made to the template.
