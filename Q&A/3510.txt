Q:Today I upgraded to Android SDK 2.3 and I also upgraded the Eclipse Plugin Androi Developer Tools 8.0 (from 0.9.9). I also upgraded my Java Development Kit to 1.6_22.

Now in Eclipse I get many errors in all my Android projects.

The error messages are like:


  The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files.


How can I fix this so I can use my Android projects again?

In the Build Path for these projects, I don't have any references to an android.jar but a message:


  Unable to get system library for project

A:That is rather difficult to answer, given the limited information you have supplied. Here are some suggestions:


Make sure that an appropriate android.jar is in your build path, since that is where java.lang.Object would come from.
Do a Project > Clean, to make sure you have 1.6 .class files, in case that is part of the problem.
Try creating a new project from scratch and see if that works.
