Q:So I started getting errors in my ADB logs which, I think, are causing my device to now display any logcat output for my app. I am getting all the logcat output except the one from the app itself.

PropertyFetcher: AdbCommandRejectedException getting properties for device 04799057970ed1fc: device offline
PropertyFetcher: AdbCommandRejectedException getting properties for device 03799467970ed5fg: device unauthorized. Please check the confirmation dialog on your device.

A:you have missed the Fingerprint Certificate Authorization dialog in your phone when you connected it, try to change the USB mode to Media, or another different than the one you have in and then reconnect your device, or go to Developer Options -> Revoke USB Debugging and reconnect, watch for the dialog and click on accept, that should solve your problems.

If that doesn't work, set your ANDROID_SDK_HOME again, and then:


Unplug device 
Run:

adb kill-server 
adb start-server

Plug in device
