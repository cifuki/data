Q:I need to parse the java-objects which are passed through xml.
I want to use for these purposes JAXB framework, because I have pre-annotated (using JAXB) java-class.

Is this possible in principle?

InputStream input = entity.getContent();
JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(new Class[] {Response.LoginResponse.class});
Unmarshaller un = jc.createUnmarshaller();
LoginResponse response = (LoginResponse)un.unmarshal(input);


in line 4, I have a warning: "unable to resolve static method 282 JAXBContext ... "
and then VM crashes

Any ideas on how to solve this problem?

A:I'm not exactly resolving your problem, but JAXB isn't included in android by default and the library will cost you 9(!) MB of your apk. Try SimpleXML instead. It has similiar abilities and much more lightweight.
