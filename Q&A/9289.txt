Q:I have a relative layout. For simplicity, there is an ImageView, EditText, and Button:


The ImageView is a banner with a fixed height
Below that is and the EditText where android:layout_width="fill_parent"
Below that is a Button with a fixed width and height


The problem is I want the editText to fill the leftover height of the screen. put and image on the top, a button on the bottom, and in the middle and edit text that takes up the rest of the space. 

What property would i have to work with to get something similar to this?

A:For this purpose, there is LinearLayout with layout_weight property. Use LinearLayout for holding these 3 elements. For Button and ImageView, set layout_height as wrap_content. For EditText set layout_height="0dp" and layout_weight="1".
