Q:I am a Linux n00b trying to setup my development environment in Eclipse. I have Eclipse and the Android SDK installed, but I am getting some errors when I start Eclipse or when I try to run ./aapt or ./adb. 

jason@ubuntu:~/usr/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools$ ./aapt
./aapt: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

jason@ubuntu:~/usr/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools$ ./adb
./adb: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64


That ELF class error makes me think I installed a wrong version of the software but I do not recall being asked to choose between x86 and x86-64. 

jason@ubuntu:~/usr/android-sdk-linux_x86$ echo $MACHTYPE
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
