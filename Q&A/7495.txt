Q:When I import a new existing project into Eclipse, I get the following error message when attempting to execute as an Android project:


  Project has no target set. Edit the
  project properties to set one


Any help is appreciated.

A:Using eclipse Juno, and there is no such menu as 
Project \xc2\xbb Properties \xc2\xbb Java Build Path anywhere.

Closest menu entry is Window->preferences->android but in that menu it is not possible to remove any entries.

My solution now is to create another project with files having the exact same name as the original project and then manually copy and paste the code.
