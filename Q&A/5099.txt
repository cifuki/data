Q:Has anyone seen this before? 


  ActivityManager: WARNING: linker: libdvm.so has text relocations. This is wasting memory and is a security risk. Please fix.


This occurs as I'm trying to deploy an app to my device.  Google doesn't seem to help at this point.

A:Were this your own jni library or native executable the solution would be to update to ndk r8c or later as discussed at:

mylib.so has text relocations. This is wasting memory and is a security risk. Please fix

in order to obtain a fix for https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=23203

However as this appears to be in a platform library (specifically the Dalvik VM itself) rather than something you built, there is not much of anything you can do. You'll likely see this on every Activity process (or at least runtime) startup, until your device manufacturer does an update. 

It is only a warning though.
