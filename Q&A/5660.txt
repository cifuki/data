Q:I just downloaded and installed Android Studio. For whatever reason, it won't open. I've tried running it as administrator, but that doesn't seem to work either. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but I'm still having this same problem.

A:Figured it out! I'm sure someone will run into this in the future, so here goes. 

Even though it found my JDK during installation, it wasn't able to find it when I was trying to open it, for some reason. Simple fix. Add a JDK_HOME environment variable to your system variables. It should contain the path to your JDK's ROOT directory. i.e. c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21\\
