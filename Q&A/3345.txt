Q:I have a dynamic HTML5 document that does not contain any external resources (no images, css and scripts are coded inside of document). This HTML5 application is working fine with internet browser. I was wondering, if it would be possible to convert this HTML5 application into standalone Android application, so it can be executed directly without browser. Please advise.

A:Create an Android app using Eclipse.

Create a layout that has a <WebView> control.

Move your HTML code to /assets folder.

Load webview with your file:///android_asset/ file.

And you have an android app!
