Q:Does anyone know of a quick color picker widget that I could grab to use in my application? 

I've seen one in a few different applications that have a wheel with colors, and that you tap in the center to select, but I'm not sure where to find it. 

Any color picker would be fine though.

A:The wheel color picker that you are talking about is in the API Demos.
