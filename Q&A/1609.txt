Q:I'm a total noob at Android programming, and wanted to learn how to debug my apps.  I can't seem to have my Log.i|d|v calls displayed in the LogCat.  

Here's the code that I'm using.  As you can see I have defined a LOG_TAG constant, but can't seem to find it in the LogCat.  I have also imported android.util.Log AND I have made sure that in my AndroidManifest I have "debuggable" set to TRUE.

I have also checked http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html w/o any luck resolving this issue.  

What am I doing wrong?  Am I even looking in the right place?  I've tried using the DDMS and Debug perspective as well w/o any luck.  Any help to this noob would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

My environment:
Windows XP
IDE = Eclipse Version: 3.6.1, Build id: M20100909-0800
Emulator = having it point to android sdk 2.1 api 7

//very basic HELLO World code with a couple of Log.i calls

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

public class debugger extends Activity {
    private static final String LOG_TAG = "debugger";

    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        Log.i(LOG_TAG, "line 13");
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        Log.i(LOG_TAG, "CREATING NOW");
    }
}

A:When using Eclipse, in the DDMS perspective, make sure the correct device (propably emulator-xxxx) is selected and highlighted. Only then will you get the logcat output in the logcat view.

Also, the Android plugin is a bit quircky, and sometimes only shows the last line in the logcat view. If this happens, try to clear the log. After that, you should get all the log entries again (works for me anyway).
