I've just downloaded the new Android Studio IDE released today, and installed it.  When I double-click the icon to launch it, nothing happens.  I've tried every shortcut to it, as well as the .exe in the installation folder.

I've also tried restarting the machine, uninstalling / restarting, and installing to a folder location without spaces.  Does someone know why Android Studio won't start?

A:I set my JDK_HOME environment variable to point to my Java (1.7) JDK path, and it worked.

My JDK path was:


  c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21


but it will vary depending on the version of your JDK.
