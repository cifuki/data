A:You just need to set xml layout for Android applications from the settings. 

Follow this steps:

1. Go to Android Studio > Preferences. For Windows, go to File > Settings.



2. Search for xml in search bar.



3. Under code style section, select xml tab.



4. In the top right corner, click on set from... and under predefined style, select Android



5. Click on Apply and try to refactor.
