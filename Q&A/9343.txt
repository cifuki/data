Q:Is there some adb or android shell command that I could run that would return a device's IMEI or MEID number? Preferably that's all that would be returned.

A:I figured out how to do this. You need to run adb shell dumpsys iphonesubinfo in a shell. It will give you a bit more than you need, but it will also return IMEI or MEID number.

Edit (2017): In Android 5.0+ you'll need to use the service call command. More info about that can be found here.
