Q:I noticed that the Activity class has two different methods to get a String resource.
This is possible by using:


getString(int resId): Return a localized string from the application's package's default string table.
getResources().getString(int id): Returns the string value associated with a particular resource ID. It will be stripped of any styled text information. 


I don't understand what's the difference between both methods. Can somebody tell me?

A:They are the same as Activity.getString(int) does exactly that:

 public final String getString(int resId) {
     return getResources().getString(resId);
 }
