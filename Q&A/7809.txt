Q:Hi I am developing an application for the android htc hero. I am looking into ways of using the inbuilt camer to read 2D barcodes and extract the string returned from the barcode. I have only recently begun working with the android sdk but I do have a programming background from working on projects with java. I am curious to know what the best way to read the 2D barcode would be. I have some sample applications that read the barcode but they are all .apk files and have no source or library that i can work with. to give you a better idea of what i am trying to accomplish this site allows the generation of 2d barcodes made up of the data you desire  here

Any replies would be greatly appreciated.

A:Android programs can interact with eachother using intents. Intents are a little like remote procedure calls: you ask the other program for a certain action (e.g. scan a barcode) and the other program will perform this task for you. The result is returned when the task is complete.

If the user has installed the ZXing Barcode Scanner, you can just use an intent to scan a barcode. The Barcode Scanner will then start, let the user scan the code and return the result to you.

More information about this scanner can be found on the Google Code page of this project: http://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/ScanningViaIntent
