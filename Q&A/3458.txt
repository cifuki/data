Q:Basically, I want an EditText in Android where I can have an integer value entered into. Perhaps there is a more appropriate object than EditText for this?

A:For now, use an EditText. Use android:inputType="number" to force it to be numeric. Convert the resulting string into an integer (e.g., Integer.parseInt(myEditText.getText().toString())).

In the future, you might consider a NumberPicker widget, once that becomes available (slated to be in Honeycomb).
