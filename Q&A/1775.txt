Q:I can't find an option to stop a running program (whether in debug or release mode).

So for now, I stop the program (returning control to Eclipse) simply by closing the emulator.

Is there a better way of doing this? Such that I don't need to close (and restart) the emulator?

A:I understand you want to stop your app on the emulator. For this you can open up the devices window (in the debug perspective), select the process and then press the stop button on the same window.
