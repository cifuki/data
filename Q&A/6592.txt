Q:I'm trying to build an Android project that has some dependencies.  The jar files are in the lib/ directory.  I can build the project by adding those jar file to my classpath, but of course it Force Closes in the emulator because those libraries aren't present.

I'm doing this from the command line with ant (not in eclipse).  How can I make it include those libraries in the apk from the command line?

A:Jay K's answer was right at the time of writing, but now the SDK has changed, and here is the new way to do it:

Add the following line to ant.properties:

jar.libs.dir=lib


Tested, works where external.libs.dir does not work.
That changed in December 2010 and then again in October 2011.
