Q:I want to create gradient background where the gradient is in the top half and there's a solid color in the bottom half, like in this image below:



I can't because the centerColor spreads out to cover the bottom and top. 



How can I make a background like the first image? How can I make small centerColor that's not spread out?

This is code in XML of background button above.

<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:shape="rectangle" >
    <gradient 
        android:startColor="#6586F0"
        android:centerColor="#D6D6D6"
        android:endColor="#4B6CD6"
        android:angle="90"/>
    <corners 
        android:radius="0dp"/>


</shape>

A:You can create this 'half-gradient' look by using an xml Layer-List to combine the top and bottom 'bands' into one file. Each band is an xml shape.

See this previous answer on SO for a detailed tutorial: Multi-gradient shapes.
