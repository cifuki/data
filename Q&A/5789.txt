Q:I'm getting a message saying "An opt-in link will be available here when you publish your app", but I don't know what else I need to do publish my alpha test apk. 

The release status says "full rollout", which indicates to me that everything is done.

I know it takes hours for it to appear but I already waited for days. What do I need to do to get this URL? If I sideload the apk that I created, will it be the same as downloading from the store (in terms of IAP authorisation)?

A:For many developers, it's just a matter of time. Rolling out merely gets you to the Pending publication stage. After some time you reach the Published stage and the URL will appear.

However, for your app, it looks like this app in unpublished. You can't opt-in to unpublished apps, so the opt-in link isn't shown.

For questions like this the Developer support team are usually really good, and we do have bugs sometimes, so it is always worth asking them.
