Q:I have a problem. When I start a new project in Android Studio and select a navigation drawer activity it happens. I don't have access to my activiy_main_drawer.xml on "Design" and it keeps saying "Waiting for build to finish.". I really don't know what I have to do. I tried to uninstall and reinstall Android Studio, and it didn't help.

A:I've just run into the exact same problem. I simply solved it by choosing Sync Project with Gradle Files. This will trigger a Gradle re-import and a build.

As of Android Studio v3.2, the icon is located near the top right tool bar. You can also find it using Find Action shortcut CtrlShiftA.
