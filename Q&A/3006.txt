Q:As there are many androidians here I guess some experience can be shared. I can't find any concrete information how often the statistics on the google play Developer Console are updated (number of installs etc). My feeling is not more than once a day. Does anybody know?

A:They are supposed to be updated once every 24 hours.

However, Google Play is notoriously unreliable with statistics, and every now and then they stop updating for a few days. Even when updating, they tend to give out of date/incorrect data.

I'd suggest integrating Google Analytics for Mobile or Flurry into your app(s) if you want good statistics.
