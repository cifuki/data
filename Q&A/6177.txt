Q:I'm trying to get a pop up text box, with some disclaimer and app info at the start of my Android application's launch. Does anyone know how to implement this? Also could it read from a txt file?

Thanks

A:If you want a Popup that closes automatically, you should look for Toasts. But if you want a dialog that the user has to close first before proceeding, you should look for a Dialog.

For both approaches it is possible to read a text file with the text you want to display. But you could also hardcode the text or use R.String to set the text.
