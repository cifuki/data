Q:I am attempting to update my android application to look better for tablets running Honeycomb. As such, I am targeting version 11 of the SDK (my minSdkVersion = 4). This adds the Honeycomb theme to my app, making it look better. However, I have no way to access my menu options. So, I am attempting to add my menu items as an action bar item with the following in the file in my /res/menu/ folder: 

android:showAsAction="ifRoom|withText"


However, I get the following error: 


  No resource identifier found for attribute 'showAsAction' in package 'android'


I tried altering my minSdkVersion number to 11 to see if it would work, but no luck. Any ideas? Thanks!

A:If you are building with Eclipse, make sure your project's build target is set to Honeycomb too.
