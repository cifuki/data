Q:I'm working on an android project which requires the use of google maps. I've been reading tutorials, and I have to add this to the AndroidManifest.xml file:

<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
    android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />


The thing is, I don't know what number to substitute the "@integer/google_play_services_version" with.

If anyone knows what I should enter there, and how to obtain that integer value, I'd appreciate it.

A:There is no need to subsitute. The value @integer/google_play_services_version takes care of it. Just make sure you have the latest Google Play Services library which is updated.

You can find it under google-play-services_lib>res>values>version.xml if you wish to add the number rather than @integer/google_play_services_version.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <integer name="google_play_services_version">4030500</integer>
</resources>
