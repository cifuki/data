Q:I applied a custom font to a TextView, but it doesn't seems to change the typeface.

Here is my code:

    Typeface myTypeface = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(), "fonts/myFont.ttf");
    TextView myTextView = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.myTextView);
    myTextView.setTypeface(myTypeface);


Can anyone please get me out of this issue?

A:On Mobiletuts+ there is very good tutorial on Text formatting for Android. Quick Tip: Customize Android Fonts

EDIT: Tested it myself now. Here is the solution. You can use a subfolder called fonts but it must go in the assets folder not the res folder. So


  assets/fonts


Also make sure that the font ending I mean the ending of the font file itself is all lower case. In other words it should not be myFont.TTF but myfont.ttf this way must be in lower case
