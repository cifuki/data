Q:I want a running example of OCR in android, I have done some research and find an example that implements OCR in android.

https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two and in it there are three projects files...


eyes-two
tess-two
tess-two-test


I have executed the "tess-two-test" project by importing the three project files but "tess-two-test" does not include any activities so it will not run.

Can anybody suggest me a better example?

A:Like you I also faced many problems implementing OCR in Android, but after much Googling I found the solution, and it surely is the best example of OCR. 

Let me explain using step-by-step guidance.

First, download the source code from https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two.

Import all three projects. After importing you will get an error.
To solve the error you have to create a res folder in the tess-two project 



First, just create res folder in tess-two by tess-two->RightClick->new Folder->Name it "res"

After doing this in all three project the error should be gone. 

Now download the source code from https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr, here you will get best example. 

Now you just need to import it into your workspace, but first you have to download android-ndk from this site:

http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html i have windows 7 - 32 bit PC so I have download http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r9-windows-x86.zip this file

Now extract it suppose I have extract it into E:\\Software\\android-ndk-r9 so I will set this path on Environment Variable 

Right Click on MyComputer->Property->Advance-System-Settings->Advance->Environment Variable-> find PATH on second below Box and set like path like below picture 



done it

Now open cmd and go to on D:\\Android Workspace\\tess-two 
like below



If you have successfully set up environment variable of NDK then just type ndk-build just like above picture than enter you will not get any kind of error and all file will be compiled successfully:

Now download other source code also from https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two , and extract and import it and give it name OCRTest, like in my PC which is in D:\\Android Workspace\\OCRTest 



Import test-two in this and run OCRTest and run it; you will get the best example of OCR.
