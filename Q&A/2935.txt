Q:I want to act my tabs to have different windowSoftInputMode properties for each  tab. How to access this property from java class when all handling of your tab is done from one single activity?

Is there any way to access this manifest property from java code?

A:Use the following to change the softInputMode for an Activity.

getWindow().setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN);


Use the following to change the softInput type for an EditText.

mEditText.setImeOptions(EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_DONE);
