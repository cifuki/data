Q:Every time I try to import a project downloaded from googlecode into Eclipse but I get some errors:


  The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot
  find the class file for java.lang.Object. Fix the build path then try
  building this project 
  
  Unable to resolve target 'android-10' (this changes from 1 to 15)


I've already checked the other answers on the site but no solution worked. 

In 


  Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries


there's 1 item:


  Unable to get system libraries for the project

A:It seems that you lack JDK (java.lang.Object comes from there )

The problem is that you used the same Android API on different PC. Eclipse is lost with path names that are differents but with same API.

To solve it, first re-select Android API version (set to another one and valid, then restore the on you want and validate it -> it will force Eclipse to reload API).
Then go into project->properties-> java build path. Then remove "Unable to get system library for the project" then "Add library" and select "Android Classpath container".
