Q:I have a ScrollView with a Datepicker 

In the previous versions of Android the Datepicker is this:



And I can scroll the single elements of Datepicker day, month, years without problems

In Android Lollipop API level 21 Material, the Datepiker is shown in this way:



If I click on the month is shown a calendar view and I cannot change the month, I can only select the day. If I try to edit the year is shown a year scroller, but If I try tro scroll it, the whole layout where datepicker is contained is scrolled, not only the date. 

calendarViewShown=false


seems ignored

How could I fix this issue???

A:The calendarViewShown attribute is deprecated in the calendar-style date picker. If you want the spinner-style date picker back, you can set the datePickerMode attribute to spinner.

<DatePicker
    ...
    android:datePickerMode="spinner" />


As for the scrolling issue, the calendar-style date picker doesn't support nested scrolling.
