Q:My project doesn't seem to be aware of this new constant that's apparently auto-generated in Android Tools r17 builds:

"Added a feature that allows you to run some code only in debug mode. Builds now generate a class called BuildConfig containing a DEBUG constant that is automatically set according to your build type. You can check the (BuildConfig.DEBUG) constant in your code to run debug-only functions such as outputting debug logs."

I've confirmed that this class is not being auto-generated anywhere in my project by the new tools. I deleted all project outputs (including all gen folders) and rebuilt, and only R.java classes are being generated.

Why are the tools not generating the BuildConfig class? It may be relevant that I'm using IntelliJ.

A:IntelliJ doesn't generate the BuildConfig java and class files. 

I assume this function is provided by the ADT plugin for Eclipse, and isn't a part of the SDK tools/common build stuff.
