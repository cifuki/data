Q:I have two different activities. The first launches the second one. In the second activity, I call System.exit(0) in order to force the application to close, but the first activity is automatically displayed instead of the application returning to the home screen. How can I avoid this, and get the application to return to the home screen?

A:You should really think about not exiting the application. This is not how Android apps usually work.
