Q:According to the question and answer posted How to automatically move to the next edit text in android , I used the code to move to the next edit box.

et1.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {

    public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start,int before, int count) 
    {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        if(et1.getText().toString().length()==size)     //size as per your requirement
        {
            et2.requestFocus();
        }
    }
    public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start,
                    int count, int after) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

    public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

});


The issue I am facing is in case I enter something wrong, then even if the user explicitly request focus , the text box moves to the next one due to the code in the text watcher. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening ?

A:You can check the key pressed for 1st EditText and if it was "Enter" key,then move focus to next EditText.

This may help you: KeyCode_Enter to next edittext
