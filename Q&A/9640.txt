Q:After updating to the last version (1.4 Beta 2) in Android Studio, the "component view" in the layout editor disappeared. How can I enable this tool again?

A:If you are looking for the component tree, go on the bottom left of Android Studio then click on the square (the one who show/hide the tool on the left, bottom and right) then on Designer. A new tab should be on the right part of android studio, with gradle and maver project.
