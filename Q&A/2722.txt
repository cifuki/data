Q:I have four activities, say A, B, C and D.
My situation is A will start the activity B by startActivityForResult.  

startActivityForResult(new Intent(this,B.class),ONE);


In other situation i will B with other situation. like 

 startActivityForResult(new Intent(this,B.class),TWO);


In B, I need to call C or D depending on requestCode. I.e if ONE need to start C else D.
So I need to know how to check the requestCode in the child Activity (B here).
In other words, I want to get the request code that Activity B was started with.

A:You can pass request code by put extra.

intent.putExtra("requestCode", requestCode);   


Or if you have used startActivityForResult many times, then better than editing each, you can override the startActivityForResult in your Activity, add you code there like this   

@Override
    public void startActivityForResult(Intent intent, int requestCode) {
        intent.putExtra("requestCode", requestCode);
        super.startActivityForResult(intent, requestCode);
    }


So there is no need to edit all your startActivityForResult
Hope it helped you
