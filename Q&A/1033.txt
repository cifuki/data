Q:I have written a couple layout files where I used the layout_weight attribute to create a ratio between different views.

At some point, I start getting lint warnings about nested weights. 

So, I wonder why are nested weights bad for performance, and if there is a more efficient way to create a constant ratio between view dimensions that could be used for different screen sizes and that doesn't need to specify a lot of dimension dpi values throught several layout files (for different screen sizes, I mean).

Thank you!

A:Nested weights are bad for performance because:


  Layout weights require a widget to be measured twice. When a
  LinearLayout with non-zero weights is nested inside another
  LinearLayout with non-zero weights, then the number of measurements
  increase exponentially.


It's better to use RelativeLayouts and adjust your view according to the places of other views without using specific dpi values.
