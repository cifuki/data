Q:I'm developing an Android app, which I therefore endlessly build and install on my test device. Since a couple days I get with every build/install a question asking 


  Google may regularly check installed apps for potentially harmfull
  behaviour. Learn more in Google Settings > Verify apps.


I get the option to Accept or Decline. I've declined about a hundred times now, but it seems to be Googles policy to keep on asking until I get sick of the message and finally click Accept. But I don't want that!

So my question: how do I let Google know once and for all that I do not want them regularly checking installed apps on my phone?

A:On Android prior to 4.2, go to Google Settings, tap Verify apps and uncheck the option Verify apps.

On Android 4.2+, uncheck the option Settings > Security > Verify apps and/or Settings > Developer options > Verify apps over USB.
