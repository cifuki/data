Q:I've set up the Android SDK and Eclipse on my machine running Windows XP and AVDs (Android Virtual Devices) are saved to "Documents and Settings\\user\\.android" by default.  Is there any way to change this behavior?  I have all of the other components saved in a directory on a separate partition and would like everything to be consolidated.  Obviously not a huge deal but does anyone here know a workaround for this?

A:Add a new user environment variable (Windows 7):

Start Menu > Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings (on the left) > Environment Variables
Add a new user variable (at the top) that points your home user directory:


  Variable name: ANDROID_SDK_HOME Variable value:
  a path to a directory of your choice





AVD Manager will use this directory to save its .android directory into it.

Alternatively, you can use the Rapid Environment Editor to set the environment variables.
