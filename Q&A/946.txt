Q:For my instrumentation tests I was using 

@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)


from

import androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnit4;


in order to establish my test cases. Now this line gets marked as deprecated with the hint to use AndroidJUnit4 from

import androidx.test.ext.junit.runners.AndroidJUnit4


However if I try to import AndroidJUnit4 from the named package I get the error, that ext can not be resolved.

Do you have an idea, what package should be included in gradle to resolve this issue?

A:According to the documentation for AndroidJUnit4, the gradle file should contain the following line:

androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.1'


After adding this, everything worked for me.

If it still doesn't work, make sure that you clean and/or rebuild your project. Also you can check the current version directly in Google's maven repository
