Q:I'm using SQLite in android. I want to drop the database.

For example: mysql- drop database dbname

How do I implement this code in SQLite?

A:The concept of creating or dropping a database is not meaningful for an embedded database engine like SQLite.  It only has meaning with a client-sever database system, such as used by MySQL or Postgres.

To create a new database, just do sqlite_open() or from the command line sqlite3 databasefilename. 

To drop a database, delete the file.
