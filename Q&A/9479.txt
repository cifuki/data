Q:I am sending push notification to users which when clicking on it opens the app.

My problem is that when the app is already open, clicking on the notification start the app again.

I only want it to start the app if its not already running.

I am using Pending Intent in the notification:

PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, new Intent(this, Splash.class), 0);


I saw posts which say use: 

<activity 
android:name=".Splash"
android:launchMode="singleTask"


but the thing is that my running app is running other activity then the splash which is finished after 7 seconds from app start, so when the app is running Splash is not the current activity

A:Use a "launch Intent" for your app, like this:

PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();
Intent launchIntent = pm.getLaunchIntentForPackage("your.package.name");
PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, launchIntent, 0);


Replace "your.package.name" with the name of your package from the Android manifest.

Also, you should remove the special launchMode="singleTask" from your manifest. Standard Android behaviour will do what you want.
