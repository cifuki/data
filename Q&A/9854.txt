Q:Anyone know of any open source implementation of a slide toggle for android. The default android toggle(ToggleButton) is not pretty. I am looking for anything similar to iOS. I should be able to implement one from scratch. But if anything similar is already available, then i can build on it.

Thanks in advance to the wonderful stackoverflow community.

Edit1:
  What I meant by iOS Slide Toggle is UISwitch





Edit2: Just want to summarize the answer. Commonsware provided the clue. I ended up back porting the Switch code from  4.0  to2.2.2. Thanks to the open-sourced code, back porting  was not very difficult.  The code is hosted on git hub. http://github.com/pellucide/Android-Switch-Demo-pre-4.0/tree/master/

A:iOS does not seem to have a "slide toggle", at least under that name, based on a Google search. And, you did not provide an image (or a link to an image) of what you want.

Android 4.0 added a Switch that you might be able to backport to earlier versions. You will see samples of it in the API Demos app on your emulator:
