Q:I'm trying to build a simple Android application using NDK.
Here are the contents of my Android.mk

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)  

include $(CLEAR_VARS)  

LOCAL_LDLIBS := -llog  

LOCAL_MODULE    := myNDK
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := native.c

include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)


And when I'm running ndk-build I get:


  make: * No rule to make target
  '/native.c', needed by
  '/Users/ivan/Documents/workspace/TestNDK/obj/local/armeabi/objs/myNDK/native.o'.
  Stop.


So the problem is obviously that make is searching the source files in the root directory and if I copy native.c to my root folder everything works perfectly.

The question is: what should I specify in my Android.mk to set the LOCAL_PATH to my working jni folder.

A:OK, I've solved my issue, and the reason was very strange:
the problem is in the first line 


  'LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)____'


It had several spaces in the end (I've replaced them with '_'). If you remove them everything works just fine.

Hope that helps someone else.
