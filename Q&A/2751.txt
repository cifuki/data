Q:Does anyone have access to a list of the default colours used in the Holo them (light and dark) on Android 4.0?

I'm looking for things like list backgrounds, primary and secondary text, ActionBar, etc.

Google gives some examples at the Themes and Color style guidelines, but they don't really go into the actual color values being used. I can grab them from the images, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather use something a little more accurate.

A:perhaps this is what you're looking for: https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/res/res/values/colors.xml
