Q:I have an application on production on Play Store which uses a login with the Facebook SDK.
When I debug the application from Eclipse there is no problem, but when its on production it gives me the following error after Facebook asks me for the permissions.
I have added on my app page on developers.facebook.com the key hash generated with keytool using this command: 


  keytool -exportcert -alias diego -keystore
  "C:\\Users\\Diego\\Desktop\\CeluChat.KeyStore" |
  "C:\\openssl\\bin\\openssl.exe" sha1 -binary |
  "C:\\openssl\\bin\\openssl.exe" base64


CeluChat.KeyStore is the keystore I used when I exported the signed application, and when keytool promts me for the password, I entered the same when exported.

But the error that gives me on production (downloaded from Play Store) is:


  10-20 22:21:10.752: W/fb4a(:):BlueServiceQueue(5872):
  com.facebook.http.protocol.ApiException: Key hash
  VQ3XhZb5_tBH9oGe2WW32DDdNS0 does not match any stored key hashes.


The Key Hash that is on the exception is different from the key hash generated with keytool. Anyway I added the Key Hash on Facebook, but it is still not working.

A:Facebook some how replaces +,- and / with _

So just try replacing _ with +, - and / and add that hash-key.

Hopefully it should work.
