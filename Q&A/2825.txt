  Developing for Android in Eclipse: R.java not generating  




I have imported a project into my Eclipse IDE, but it's giving me an error since R file is not generated automatically.

How can I edit the R file so that it matches my project requirements?

A:In  another stackoverflow question, somebody answered this : you must get rid of warnings and errors (syntax and links) in your xml files. This plus doing a clean / build project.

Project -> Clean, and choose the option to build the project.
