Q:Possible Duplicate:
  Android Spinner OnItemSelected Called Erroneously (without user action on opening spinner)  




Does anyone know how to prevent the onItemSelected() (OnItemSelectedListener interface) method from running when the layout is instantiated?  I need to know if there is a way to do this because I want to keep how I instantiate my layout separate from this listener. 

I have tried creating an if statement initially set to false around all the code inside of the overridden method, but there is no way of knowing when to set it to true because the overridden method runs after the onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume() methods everytime.

I have not found any clear cut answers on this.  Any clear cut solutions would be greatly appreciated.

A:David, here is a tutorial I wrote up for this problem...

Problem Statement

an undesirable onItemSelected() is triggered whilst the Gallery (or Spinner) is initializing.
This means that code is prematurely executed; code which is intended to execute ONLY when a user physically makes a selection.

Solution


in onCreate(), count how many Gallery (or Spinner) widgets you have in the view. (mGalleryCount)
in onItemSelected(), count how often it has triggered. (mGalleryInitializedCount)
when (mGalleryInitializedCount < mGalleryCount) == false, then execute the code meant for the user


Code Example

public class myActivity extends Activity implements OnItemSelectedListener
{
    //this counts how many Gallery's are on the UI
    private int mGalleryCount=0;

    //this counts how many Gallery's have been initialized
    private int mGalleryInitializedCount=0;

    //UI reference
    private Gallery mGallery;


    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.myxmllayout);

        //get references to UI components
        mGallery = (Gallery) findViewById(R.id.mygallery);

        //trap selection events from gallery
        mGallery.setOnItemSelectedListener(this);

        //trap only selection when no flinging is taking place
        mGallery.setCallbackDuringFling(false);

        //
        //do other stuff like load images, setAdapter(), etc
        //

        //define how many Gallery's are in this view
        //note: this could be counted dynamically if you are programmatically creating the view
        mGalleryCount=1;

    }


    public void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int position, long id)
    {

        if (mGalleryInitializedCount < mGalleryCount)
        {
            mGalleryInitializedCount++;
        }
        else
        {
            //only detect selection events that are not done whilst initializing
            Log.i(TAG, "selected item position = " + String.valueOf(position) );
        }

    }

}


Why this works

this solution works because the Gallery finishes initialization long before a user is physically able to make a selection.
