Q:I am struggling mightily with installing ADT (Android Dev Tools) on Eclipse in Fedora 16 OS, 64-bit.

Eclipse itself is running fine.

As instructed, I first installed the regular Android SDK, the OS-level toolkit. That went smoothly and I was able to use the Android app within the tools dir.

In Eclipse, it was a little more difficult because I first had to install GWT or google-related tools, which required a core Eclipse Indigo update of WST. Finally, the ADT install reported success.

However, every time when opening Eclipse, it gives me a multitude of popups regarding libncurses.so.5 and the following log:

[2012-04-04 02:06:35 - adb] /opt/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

When I do try to open Android SDK Manager (under Window), the plugin does open but the window has no close button anywhere (unlike the same one at the OS-level, which also looks the same) so the only way to get out of it is to find the Eclipse PID and kill it.

A:This solved the problem entirely:

yum install ncurses-libs.i686 libstdc++.i686 libgcc.i686
