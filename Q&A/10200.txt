Q:I'm currently running the latest version of Android Studio, v3.2.1. The virtual devices available only go up to the Pixel 2 (and the XL version). These do not suffice since I mainly need to test on the new Google Pixel 3 XL, due to its notch.



Is it possible to get the new Pixel 3 (and XL version) loaded into Android Studio's emulators for testing?

A:To add a notch in the emulator, choose any device with Android Pie system image (9.0). Build it, then go to Settings > System > expand 'Advanced' > Developer options > 'Drawing' section > 'Simulate a display with a cutout' on the emulator.

You can use it until they add the official skin



*NOTE: The 'Developer' option is not shown by default on Android phones. Please see the Android Documentation to learn out how to enable it.
