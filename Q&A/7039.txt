Q:I am currently creating an application that have some strings (>300 for now) and I have some problems to quickly find a string  with so many of them.
So I was considering the possibility of using several string.xml files instead of only one (string_menu, string_activity1, ...).

Is there any side-effect with this practice? Is it a bad or a good practice?

I ask this because it seems that no many people on the net are using this possibility.
So maybe there is some problem with it?

A:As stated in the documentation you can use whatever filename you want:


  The filename is arbitrary. The <string> element's name will be used as the resource ID.
