Q:Say I have a created a dialog in my Android app like so:

private static ProgressDialog dialog;
dialog = ProgressDialog.show(MainActivity.this, "", "Downloading Files. Please wait...", true);


Now, is it possible to fire an event when the following is called?

dialog.dismiss();


The reason I want to do this and not just call my method after dialog.dismiss(); is because the Dialog dismiss is called within a static class and the next thing I want to do is load a new Activity (which cannot be done using Intents within a static class).

A:Use an OnDismissListener.

There is a setOnDismissListener(...) method in the class Dialog
