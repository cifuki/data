A:Probably the project you are running is not compatible (API version/Hardware requirements) with the emulator settings. Check in your build.gradle file if the targetSDK and minimumSdk version is lower or equal to the sdk version of your Emulator.

You should also uncheck Tools > Android > Enable ADB Integration

If your case is different then restart your Android Studio and run the emulator again.
