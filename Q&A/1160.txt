Q:I'm trying to read a text file line by line using InputStream from the assets directory in Android.

I want to convert the InputStream to a BufferedReader to be able to use the readLine().

I have the following code:

InputStream is;
is = myContext.getAssets().open ("file.txt");
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader (is);


The third line drops the following error:

Multiple markers at this line
The constructor BufferedReader (InputStream) is undefinded.

What I'm trying to do in C would be something like:

StreamReader file;
file = File.OpenText ("file.txt");

line = file.ReadLine();
line = file.ReadLine();
...


What am I doing wrong or how should I do that? Thanks!

A:BufferedReader can't wrap an InputStream directly. It wraps another Reader. In this case you'd want to do something like:

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, "UTF-8"));
