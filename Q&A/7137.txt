Q:Hey i need to wake my sleeping android device up at a certain time.
Any suggestions?

P.S. Wake up: turn display on and maybe unlock phone

A:Best is to use some appropriate combination of these window flags:

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON

If you want to run on older versions of the platform that don't support the desired flag(s), you can directly use wake locks and keyguard locks...  but that path is fraught with peril.

ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: Your activity must be full screen in order for the above flag combination to work. In my app I tried to use these flags with an activity which is not full screen (Dialog Theme) and it didn't work. After looking at the documentation I found that these flags require the window to be a full screen window.
