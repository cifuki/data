Q:I am developing an android application. I want to update the local SQLite database with MySQL database on server. I am not able to figure out that what is the most appropriate and standardized way to do so?

A:Create a webservice (REST is probably best) and serialize your SQLite/MySQL data and PUT/POST/GET it to/from your web service. This will give you a nice layer of abstraction in case you decide to switch from MySQL to something else server side.
