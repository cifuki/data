Q:When I load an image from the media gallery into a Bitmap, everything is working fine, except that pictures that were shot with the camera while holding the phone vertically, are rotated so that I always get a horizontal picture even though it appears vertical in the gallery.
Why is that and how can I load it correctly?

A:Have you looked at the EXIF data of the images? It may know the orientation of the camera when the picture was taken.
