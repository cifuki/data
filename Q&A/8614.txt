Q:I would just like to ask if SurfaceFlinger is always called for any type of drawing into the screen? 
Example, displaying of JPG file to the screen.

A:SurfaceFlinger is not what draws your window.  It allocates a frame buffer for your window, which the framework running in your application draws directly to without interacting with SurfaceFlinger.  The only interaction SurfaceFlinger is involved with when you draw your window is to composite the final new frame buffer to the screen once you are done drawing a frame.
