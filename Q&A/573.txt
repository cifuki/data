Q:I ported my Android app to honeycomb and I did a big refactor in order to use fragments. In my previous version, when I pressed the Home button I used to do a ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP in order to reset the back stack. 

Now my app is just a single Activity with multiple fragments, so when I press the Home button I just replace one of the fragments inside it. How can I clear my back stack without having to use startActivity with the ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP flag?

A:I posted something similar here

From Joachim's answer, from Dianne Hackborn:

I ended up just using:

FragmentManager fm = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager();
for(int i = 0; i < fm.getBackStackEntryCount(); ++i) {    
    fm.popBackStack();
}


But could equally have used something like:

((AppCompatActivity)getContext()).getSupportFragmentManager().popBackStack(String name, FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE)


Which will pop all states up to the named one. You can then just replace the fragment with what you want
