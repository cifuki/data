Q:I have an Android EditText that I want to have the number keyboard come up. 

If I set the android:inputType to numberSigned, I get the number keyboard and the ability to type in negatives.  However this won't let me use decimals.  If I use the numberDecimal inputType I can use decimals but not negatives. 

How do you get the number keyboard with the ability to type in decimals and negatives?

A:You are just missing this in your EditText,

android:inputType="numberDecimal|numberSigned"
