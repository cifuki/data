Q:Background

I'm trying to put a layer on top of the current activity which would have explanation of what is going on on the current screen, similar to what occurs on contact+ app .

I know there are some solutions for this (like the showCase library and the superToolTips  library ) , and I also know that I can create a view and set it on top by adding it to the window of the activity , but I need put a whole dialog layer on top.

Problem

No matter what I try, each solution doesn't work the way I need it to work.

in short , what I need is:


full screen dialog.
no change (not visual and not logical) to the action bar, notification bar, and content of the activity behind, meaning that everything behind the dialog stays the same it was shown a moment before the dialog was shown.
be transparent except for the views I use for the dialog, which should be shown normally.


what I've tried

Sadly, I've always got only a part of the things I needed.

here's my code:

styles.xml:

<style name="full_screen_dialog">
        <item name="android:windowFrame">@null</item>
        <item name="android:windowIsFloating">true</item>
        <item name="android:windowContentOverlay">@null</item>
        <item name="android:windowAnimationStyle">@android:style/Animation.Dialog</item>
        <item name="android:windowSoftInputMode">stateUnspecified|adjustPan</item>
    </style>


MainActivity.java:

...
final Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this, R.style.full_screen_dialog);
dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
dialog.setContentView(R.layout.floating_tutorial);
dialog.getWindow().setLayout(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT);
dialog.getWindow().setFormat(PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT);
dialog.show();


This code will put the layout on top of the activity, but sadly it doesn't have any transparency , even though I've set it . The layout I've used is very simple which is why I don't post it.

Question

what am I missing ? what should be done to fix the code? 

how can I make the dialog both transparent, full screen AND that it won't change the action bar and notifications bar.



Working solution

EDIT: after finding a good solution, here's the working code:

@Override
protected void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    final Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this);
    dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
    dialog.setContentView(R.layout.floating_tutorial);
    final Window window = dialog.getWindow();
    window.setLayout(WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT);
    window.clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DIM_BEHIND);
    window.setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(Color.TRANSPARENT));
    dialog.show();
}

A:Just change the background color of your Dialog:

dialog.getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(Color.TRANSPARENT));


Edit:

This prevents the dim effect:

dialog.getWindow().clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DIM_BEHIND);
