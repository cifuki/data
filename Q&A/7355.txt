A:I don't know if it will be useful anymore, but I made a custom library which allows you to change space beetwen stars programatically and in XML (among other stuff): SimpleRatingBar.

It features:


Fully working android:layout_width: it can be set to wrap_content, match_parent or abritary dp.
Arbitrary number of stars.
Arbitrary step size.
Size of stars can be controlled exactly or by setting a maximum size.
Customizable colors in normal state (border, fill and background of stars and rating bar).
Customizable colors in pressed state (border, fill and background of stars and rating bar).
Customizable size separation between stars.
Customizable border width of stars.
Customizable stars corner radius.
Allows to set OnRatingBarChangeListener
Stars fill can be set to start from left to right or from right to left (RTL language support).
AnimationBuilder integrated in the view to set rating programatically with animation.


Here is a preview of it.

In your case, you would just have to do:

ratingbar.setStarsSeparation(20, Dimension.DP);


or, for example, in pixels:

ratingbar.setStarsSeparation(100, Dimension.PX);


You can find it either in jcenter or in Maven Central. So in your build.gradle file just add to your dependencies:

compile 'com.iarcuschin:simpleratingbar:0.1.+'
