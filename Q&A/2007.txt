Q:I have two RadioButtons inside a RadioGroup. I want to set OnClickListener on those RadioButtons. Depending on which RadioButton is clicked, I want to change the text of an EditText. How can I achieve this?

A:I'd think a better way is to use RadioGroup and set the listener on this to change and update the View accordingly (saves you having 2 or 3 or 4 etc listeners).

    RadioGroup radioGroup = (RadioGroup) findViewById(R.id.yourRadioGroup);        
    radioGroup.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new OnCheckedChangeListener() 
    {
        @Override
        public void onCheckedChanged(RadioGroup group, int checkedId) {
            // checkedId is the RadioButton selected
        }
    });
