Q:I waste a lot of time trying to successfully install the ADB driver for my tablet in Windows 8.1. So here I will post what I did, in case anyone has the same problem.

If Windows fails to enumerate the device which is reported in Device Manager as error code 43:


Install this Compatibility update from Windows.
If you already have this update but you get this error, restart your PC (unfortunately, it happened to me, I tried everything until I thought what if I restart...).


If the device is listed in Device Manager as Other devices -> Android but reports an error code 28:


Google USB Driver didn't work for me. You could try your corresponding OEM USB Drivers, but in my case my device is not listed there.
So, install the latest Samsung drivers: SAMSUNG USB Driver v1.5.33.0  |  Official site (v1.5.51.0)
Restart the computer (very important)
Go to Device Manager, find the Android device, and select Update Driver Software.
Select Browse my computer for driver software
Select Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer
Select ADB Interface from the list
Select SAMSUNG Android ADB Interface (this is a signed driver). If you get a warning, select Yes to continue.
Done!


By doing this I was able to use my tablet for development under Windows 8.1.

Note: This solution uses Samsung drivers but works for other devices.
