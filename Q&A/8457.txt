Q:I have a simple Tango Unity app which uses the Tango AR Camera prefab to display a 3D object in augmented reality.

Following this question, I wanted to try out the occlusion feature provided by TangoARScreen. 

Therefore I have:


checked the "Enable Occlusion" checkbox
enabled depth detection in Tango Manager
added a Tango Point Cloud with Update points mesh enabled.


However the 3D object never gets hidden by foreground real-world objects. What am I missing?

Is there any sample project that demonstrates this "Enable Occlusion" feature?

A:Try to look in the Unity Examples, the one named ExperimentalMeshOcclusion.

I just ran it and the occlusion there works well, so you can see the scene objects and the code being used.
