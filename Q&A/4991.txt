A:Use String class method while setting the text to TextView as

tv.setText(strings.toUpperCase());


Have a look at this post for detail discussion.

EDIT: This was answered way back before API 14. As other answer mentioned here, textView.isAllCaps = true and its java methods were introduced from TextView. Please use those.
