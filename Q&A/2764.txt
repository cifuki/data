A:I had installed Android studio and was not able to access the AVD Manager directly. I had to follow the steps as mentioned below:


Created a blank project using Android Studio
Once the Project is ready to use I tried open action using the shortcut  ctrl+shift+a option and searched for AVD Manager 
AVD Manager
On double clicking the AVD Manager I got a few errors in console about the missing libararies along with the link to install the neccessary dependencies. On clicking the links which was displayed with the error message few packages which were needed were installed. Once all the required packages were installed the AVD Manager icon becomes active.
