Q:I am trying to debug the android source using Eclipse by following the instructions found at:

http://source.android.com/using-eclipse

I have downloaded the source, and gotten it to build.  I follow the directions in the link above and everything is fine until I run the ddms command.  At this point, if Eclipse is running I get the error 'Could not open Selected VM debug port (8700)'.  If I close Eclipse, then ddms runs with no problem, and I can the the processes on the emulator.  However, if I now open Eclipse, I get the same error.

In any case, no matter what I do, if I attempt to remote debug, it always fails with 'Failed to connect to remote VM'.

Any ideas?

Thanks

A:It looks like you have two problems:


You are trying to run DDMS twice.  You do not need to run the free standing version of DDMS since there is version of it integrated in Eclipse as part of the Android plug-in.  If you change to the DDMS perspective in Eclipse, I'm sure you will find that all the same features are available.
You have not told DDMS which VM you want to debug at localhost:8700.  Before you attempt to establish your remote debug connection, you must go to the DDMS perspective and click on the system_process (or whatever process you want to debug).
