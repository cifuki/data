Q:I'm designing one application in which I want to show specific location on Map.
I'm passing String of address which is already placed on Google Map.
Following is my Intent code..

String url = "http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr="+address;
Intent intent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW,  Uri.parse(url));
startActivity(intent);


But it gives me Google Map for getting direction. I know why that so, because I used daddr in url but I don't know what to use for specific location..Please tell me what to use there..

A:I have not tested this but you could try :

First method:

String uri = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, "geo:%f,%f", latitude, longitude);
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(uri));
context.startActivity(intent);


EDIT:
This might not work with Google maps 7,0

hence you could change the uri to : 

Second option:

String geoUri = "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:" + lat + "," + lng + " (" + mTitle + ")";


where mTitle is the name of the location.

Third option:

geo:0,0?q=my+street+address


Fourth option:

String map = "http://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=" + yourAddress;


Hope that works and helps :D..
