Q:I've been trying to get foreign keys working within my Android SQLite database. I have tried the following syntax but it gives me a force close:

private static final String TASK_TABLE_CREATE = "create table "
            + TASK_TABLE + " (" + TASK_ID
            + " integer primary key autoincrement, " + TASK_TITLE
            + " text not null, " + TASK_NOTES + " text not null, "
    + TASK_DATE_TIME + " text not null, FOREIGN KEY ("+TASK_CAT+") REFERENCES "+CAT_TABLE+" ("+CAT_ID+"));";


Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? if you need to see the other table structure then I can, its just a very simple structure for the second with an ID and a name.

Edit: 

Here is the error:


  03-13 13:42:35.389:
  ERROR/AndroidRuntime(312): Caused by:
  android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException:
  unknown column "taskCat" in foreign

  (_id integer primary key
  autoincrement, task_title text not
  null, notes text not null,
  reminder_date_time text not null,
  FOREIGN KEY (taskCat) REFERENCES
  category (_id));

A:You have to define your TASK_CAT column first and then set foreign key on it.

private static final String TASK_TABLE_CREATE = "create table "
        + TASK_TABLE + " (" 
        + TASK_ID + " integer primary key autoincrement, " 
        + TASK_TITLE + " text not null, " 
        + TASK_NOTES + " text not null, "
        + TASK_DATE_TIME + " text not null,"
        + TASK_CAT + " integer,"
        + " FOREIGN KEY ("+TASK_CAT+") REFERENCES "+CAT_TABLE+"("+CAT_ID+"));";


More information you can find on sqlite foreign keys doc.
