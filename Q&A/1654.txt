Q:The new documentation on ProGuard for Android says to add a line to the default.properties file in the project home directory. However, on opening this file, I read at the top: 

# This file is automatically generated by Android Tools. 
# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED! 


Am I missing something?

Also, is there a way to enable ProGuard only for a production build from Eclipse (i.e., when exporting the finished product)?

A:just a follow-up because I was searching for the same thing - and the answers here are outdated - lately the base proguard config is here in the sdk dir - so you only have to put this into your project.properties:

proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt


if you want to make project-specific modifications, create a proguard-project.txt and change the line to:

proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt
