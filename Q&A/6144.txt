Q:Fairly new to android development. I am trying to use retrofit to send a post request. In my retrofit logs, I am seeing

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8


I found that requests will only work if I use the content type:

application/x-www-form-urlencoded


I have searched the googles and have found no clear way to explicitly set the content type. Anyone know how to do it?

A:In the class where you define your service, modify the related method to follow the pattern below:

@FormUrlEncoded
@POST/GET/PUT/DELETE("/your_endpoint")
Object yourMethodName(@Field("your_field") String yourField,...);
