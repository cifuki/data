Q:I downloaded collection of icons from Android Developers center
Each icon in this collection is ordered in forlders according to its resolution: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-xhdpi, drawable-xxhdpi.

Is there a way to import all the 4 icon's files in one action to Android Studio or I need to copy it one by one? 
(when I used new->Image Asset , I had to fill a file path, I couldn't fill it with folder path)

Update 25/2/15:
According to this SO question, seems like there is a way to generate the 4 size of icons by Android Asset Studio, and then import the zip file directly to your Android Studio project res folder - has anyone used it?

After Android Studios 1.5 android support Vector Asset Studio.



Follow this, which says:


  To start Vector Asset Studio:
  
  
  In Android Studio, open an Android app project. 
  In the Project window, select the Android view.
  Right-click the res folder and select New > Vector Asset.
