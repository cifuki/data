Q:I have a rather large Android app that relies on many library projects. The Android compiler has a limitation of 65536 methods per .dex file and I am surpassing that number. 

There are basically two paths you can choose (at least that I know of) when you hit the method limit.

1) Shrink your code

2) Build multiple dex files (see this blog post)

I looked into both and tried to find out what was causing my method count to go so high. The Google Drive API takes the biggest chunk with the Guava dependency at over 12,000. Total libs for Drive API v2 reach over 23,000!

My question I guess is, what do you think I should do? Should I remove Google Drive integration as a feature of my app? Is there a way to shrink the API down (yes, I use proguard)? Should I go the multiple dex route (which looks rather painful, especially dealing with third party APIs)?

A:It looks like Google has finally implementing a workaround/fix for surpassing the 65K method limit of dex files.


  About the 65K Reference Limit
  
  Android application (APK) files contain
  executable bytecode files in the form of Dalvik Executable (DEX)
  files, which contain the compiled code used to run your app. The
  Dalvik Executable specification limits the total number of methods
  that can be referenced within a single DEX file to 65,536, including
  Android framework methods, library methods, and methods in your own
  code. Getting past this limit requires that you configure your app
  build process to generate more than one DEX file, known as a multidex
  configuration.
  
  Multidex support prior to Android 5.0
  
  Versions of the platform prior to Android 5.0 use the Dalvik runtime
  for executing app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single
  classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this
  limitation, you can use the multidex support library, which becomes
  part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to
  the additional DEX files and the code they contain.
  
  Multidex support for Android 5.0 and higher
  
  Android 5.0 and higher uses a runtime called ART which natively
  supports loading multiple dex files from application APK files. ART
  performs pre-compilation at application install time which scans for
  classes(..N).dex files and compiles them into a single .oat file for
  execution by the Android device. For more information on the Android
  5.0 runtime, see Introducing ART.

  Multidex Support Library
  
  This library provides support for building
  apps with multiple Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. Apps that reference
  more than 65536 methods are required to use multidex configurations.
  For more information about using multidex, see Building Apps with Over
  65K Methods.
  
  This library is located in the /extras/android/support/multidex/
  directory after you download the Android Support Libraries. The
  library does not contain user interface resources. To include it in
  your application project, follow the instructions for Adding libraries
  without resources.
  
  The Gradle build script dependency identifier for this library is as
  follows:
  
  com.android.support:multidex:1.0.+ This dependency notation specifies
  the release version 1.0.0 or higher.




You should still avoid hitting the 65K method limit by actively using proguard and reviewing your dependencies.
