Q:I have an HTML login form that contains following elements (in this order):


input type=text (user name input)
input type=password (password)
input type=submit (Login button)


Why does the Android browser show "Go" button in soft keyboard instead of "Next" button when the focus is in the text input? This causes user to fail to login very easily because after entering the user name, the user presses the bottom right button in the keyboard (usually the correct action) and the form will be submitted with an empty password, which obviously is not going to work. [This behavior would make sense in case my browser was set to remember passwords and the password manager would be able to fill in the password. However, this is not the case here as you can test yourself below.]

I'd like to have the input type text to have "Next" button and the input type password (the last input before the submit) to have the "Go" button.

An example of problematic form is at https://peda.net/:login (this form contains code to detect "Enter" key for the input and prevents submitting the form unless the last visible form input is focused).

Do you know a real fix for this issue? I know that if I were implementing native application, I'd use android:imeOptions="actionNext" (see How to change the Android softkey keyboard "Go" button to "Next"). However, in this case it's an HTML form and Android default browser.

The problem is visible with at least following configurations:


"Browser" system app running on Android 2.3.4 (Cyanogenmod 7)
"Browser" system app running on Android 4.2.2 (Cyanogenmod 10.1)
"Browser" system app running on Android 4.3.1 (Cyanogenmod 10.2 M1)
"Browser" system app (AOSP Browser) running on Android 4.4.2 (Cyanogenmod 11.0 M3)
"Browser" system app (AOSP Browser) running on Android 5.5.1 (Cyanogenmod 12.1) [has an arrow icon instead of word "Go"]
"Browser" system app (AOSP Browser) running on Android 6.0.1 (Cyanogenmod 13.0) [has an arrow icon instead of word "Go"]

A:The Android Browser always displays Go for input fields because some forms on the web (especially search boxes) have no submit button, and can only be activated by pressing Enter (Go is equivalent to Enter).

Instead some versions of Android will show a tab key in the bottom right of the keyboard to facilitate navigating between form fields.

I don't think you can prevent either of these behaviours.

Two possible workarounds:


Use JavaScript to ignore submission of the login form until both inputs are non-blank:

<form name="loginForm" onsubmit="return document.loginForm.user.value != '' && document.loginForm.pass.value != ''">
    <input type="text" name="user">
    <input type="password" name="pass">
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>

The cleanest solution would be to set both inputs to be required using the new HTML5 required attribute - but the Android Browser doesn't support this yet. However a good approach would be to supplement the required attribute with a JavaScript fallback such as that described by CSSKarma.
