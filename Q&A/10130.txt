Q:I have an Activity which is basically my main activity and its launch mode is single instance. But because of singleInstance, the onActivityResult() callback does not fire. And if  I change the launch mode in my manifest file to any other mode it works fine.

Can you explain why this callback is not working?

A:I believe that the problem is that singleInstance doesn't let the callee activity to exist in the same task as the caller, hence it can't return the value to the caller.

Consider using singleTask instead:

singleTask


  The system creates the activity at the
  root of a new task and routes the
  intent to it. However, if an instance
  of the activity already exists, the
  system routes the intent to existing
  instance through a call to its
  onNewIntent() method, rather than
  creating a new one.


singleInstance


  Same as "singleTask", except that the
  system doesn't launch any other
  activities into the task holding the
  instance. The activity is always the
  single and only member of its task.
