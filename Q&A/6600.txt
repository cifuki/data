A:According to Amazon's FAQ on Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire has USB debugging enabled by default. To connect Kindle Fire to your Android Debug Bridge (ADB) follow the instructions in this PDF.If you are working with Windows 7 you will need to download and use this driver. They are also providing USB drivers for download for Windows 7 PC. Moreover, we can also emulate Kindle Fire specs on Android emulator by using the following parameters.


Width: 600px
Height: 1024px
Abstracted LCD Density: 169
Target: Android 2.3.4 - API Level 10
RAM: 512 MB


They don't offer separate developer devices. You can use the Kindle Fire devices which you can buy online.

After installing the device driver, I had to modify your adb_usb.ini


Open the C:\\Users\\< your-login >\\.android\\adb_usb.ini file for editing
Add 0x1949
Save the file
