Q:I am using Eclipse Indigo, testing on 2 emulators(2.2 and 3.0).

the code below shows what I am testing now, however setting the text size reveals nothing on the screen when trying to run the emulator.(if i comment out the text size the text shows up with a red color). I thought that somehow eclipse wasn't rebuilding the code but i added the line of code to add the blue background and that worked. I have tried setting the text size after setting the text with still no success. the code is below. thanks for your help! 
(disclaimer) - i am trying to stay away from xml. Being that i already know java i don't want to depend on that. 

import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class TestAndroidvs2Activity extends Activity {
/** Called when the activity is first created. */
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    TextView text = new TextView(this);
    text.setTextColor(Color.RED);
    text.setTextSize(2);    
    text.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE);
    text.setText("Hello Android");


    setContentView(text);
  }
}

A:Text size 2 will be practically invisible. Try it with 14 at least. BTW, using xml has a lot of advantages and will make your life easier once you need to do anything more complex than 'Hello World'.
