Q:I previously developped Android apps on Android Studio . Everything works fine.

I work on real device, and Android Studio recognize it without issue.

Suddenly when I exit android studio and  disconnect and reconnect my device, it doesn't recognize my device anymore, I have to exit and restart Android Studio.

I can't find a way to "Reset adb" like Android Studio.

I follow the below instruction(Tools->Android->Enable ADB Integration) and enabled ADB,but still below error occurred.

Error:-



I using windows system.

Any help great appreciation.
