Q:I know that Android 6.0 has new permissions and I know I can call them with something like this 

if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) !=
    PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this,
        new String[] { 
            Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
        }, PERMISSION_WRITE_STORAGE);
}


Today I saw a Google app which needs 3 permissions: contacts, sms and camera. It's making a page 1-3 and calls them all together at the same time to activate.

Can anybody tell me how I can call 4 permissions to activate at the same time like sms, camera, contacts and storage?

Example (forgot the name of the google app :( )
The app needs sms,contacts and camera 

the app asked me (and made a dialog page1-3) activate sms, activate contacts and then camera. 
So this google app was calling all 3 required permissions together and my question is how can i achive the same ?

A:Just include all 4 permissions in the ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(...) call and Android will automatically page them together like you mentioned.

I have a helper method to check multiple permissions and see if any of them are not granted.

public static boolean hasPermissions(Context context, String... permissions) {
    if (context != null && permissions != null) {
        for (String permission : permissions) {
            if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(context, permission) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}


Or in Kotlin:

fun hasPermissions(context: Context, vararg permissions: String): Boolean = permissions.all {
    ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(context, it) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED
}


Then just send it all of the permissions.  Android will ask only for the ones it needs.

// The request code used in ActivityCompat.requestPermissions()
// and returned in the Activity's onRequestPermissionsResult()
int PERMISSION_ALL = 1; 
String[] PERMISSIONS = {
  android.Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS, 
  android.Manifest.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS, 
  android.Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, 
  android.Manifest.permission.READ_SMS, 
  android.Manifest.permission.CAMERA
};

if(!hasPermissions(this, PERMISSIONS)){
    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, PERMISSIONS, PERMISSION_ALL);
}
