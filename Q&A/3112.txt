Q:Whenever I created new project in android studio, I got android:supportsRtl="true" in my app AndroidManifest File.

<application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:supportsRtl="true"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
...
</application>


What is use in app, or what is advantages & disadvantage when I add or not add in my app AndroidManifest .

A:Declares whether your application is willing to support right-to-left
  (RTL) layouts. If set to true and targetSdkVersion is set to 17 or
  higher, various RTL APIs will be activated and used by the system so
  your app can display RTL layouts. If set to false or if
  targetSdkVersion is set to 16 or lower, the RTL APIs will be ignored
  or will have no effect and your app will behave the same regardless of
  the layout direction associated to the user's Locale choice (your
  layouts will always be left-to-right).
  
  The default value of this attribute is false.
  
  This attribute was added in API level 17.
