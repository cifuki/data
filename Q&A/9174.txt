Q:I'm attempting to transition from Eclipse to Android Studio today. I generated the Gradle build files in Eclipse and imported into Android Studio. I changed my preferences to run the app from a USB device instead of the emulator. Now when I run my app with my phone plugged in, all I get is a message that says "Waiting for device."

Has anyone else tried out Android Studio and got an app running on their phone? I'd appreciate any advice. I've been trying for quite a while now.

A:I get this from time to time and a simple unplug/replug of the device does the trick.
