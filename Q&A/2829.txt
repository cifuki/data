A:Option 1- From Studio

In Android Studio, go to File > Project Structure. Then select the "project" tab on the left.

Your Gradle version will be displayed here.

Option 2- gradle-wrapper.properties

If you are using the Gradle wrapper, then your project will have a gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties folder. 

This file should contain a line like this: 

distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1-all.zip


This determines which version of Gradle you are using. In this case, gradle-2.2.1-all.zip means I am using Gradle 2.2.1.

Option 3- Local Gradle distribution

If you are using a version of Gradle installed on your system instead of the wrapper, you can run gradle --version to check.
