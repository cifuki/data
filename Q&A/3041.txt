Q:I'm getting multiple "Failed to Resolve" issues when syncing my project. They are all firebase and play-services related. I made sure they are all the same (11.2.0). I've also checked and the latest version for both is 11.2.0. Also, all the other answers to similar questions involve updating Google play services and repository in the SDK Manager but mine is already up to date. 





Any idea why I can't sync my project?

EDIT - Current working solution

// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.3'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
        classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-plugins:1.0.4'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://maven.google.com" } 
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}

A:Add maven { url "https://maven.google.com" } to your root level build.gradle file

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url "https://maven.google.com"
        }
    }
}
