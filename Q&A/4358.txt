Q:I have an EditText in my application. I want to align the text in it to the right instead of the default left. I tried adding 

android:layout_gravity="right"


but this doesn't seem to work. any other suggestions please?

A:You should use android:gravity="right". layout_gravity is for the view (EditText) alignment against the container.
