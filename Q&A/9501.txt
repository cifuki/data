Q:I'm implementing a MediaPlayer. Everything goes smoothly BUT each time I encounter a new error it can be very hard to find its meaning. The official doc is lacking in that area, so a website like stack overflow is the only solution and this time even this does not work (error (1;-107) btw).

So is there a centralized point where I can find the list of all the MediaPlayer error codes ? I can't find it in the official documentation, and it would be tremendously helpful to quickly diagnose new errors.

A:Just go through the pvmf return codes from the link below,

https://github.com/android/platform_external_opencore/blob/master/pvmi/pvmf/include/pvmf_return_codes.h

And the complete explanation of each error from another link below
