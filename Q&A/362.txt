Q:I need to implement a horizontal listview in my Android application. I did a bit of research and came across How can I make a horizontal ListView in Android? and Horizontal ListView in Android? however, these questions were asked before Recyclerview was released. Is there a better way to implement this now with Recyclerview?

Yes.

When you use a RecyclerView, you need to specify a LayoutManager that is responsible for laying out each item in the view. The LinearLayoutManager allows you to specify an orientation, just like a normal LinearLayout would.

To create a horizontal list with RecyclerView, you might do something like this:

LinearLayoutManager layoutManager
    = new LinearLayoutManager(this, LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, false);

RecyclerView myList = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.my_recycler_view);
myList.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);
