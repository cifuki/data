Q:I have ActionBarActivity with NavigationDrawer and use support_v7 Toolbar as ActionBar. In one of my fragments toolbar has custom view. In other fragments Toolbar should show title.

How get Toolbar instance for customizing from fragments? I can get ActionBar with getActivity().getActionBar(), but if I call setTitle() for this instance ActionBar it do nothing.

UPD:

In my case 

((ActionBarActivity) getActivity()).getSupportActionBar().setTitle();

(as MrEngineer13 said) don't work at first fragment creation because I call it from onHiddenChanged(). Now I add more one to onCreateView() and it works fine.

A:You need to cast your activity from getActivity() to AppCompatActivity first. Here's an example:

((AppCompatActivity) getActivity()).getSupportActionBar().setTitle();


The reason you have to cast it is because getActivity() returns a FragmentActivity and you need an AppCompatActivity
