Q:Since I reinstalled Eclipse (simply deleted and downloaded it again) I can't debug my applications on Samsung Galaxy i9001 (with CyanogenMod - Android 4.4.2). It worked fine before reinstallation.

Unplug/plug, Uncheck/check "Debug Enabled", adb kill-server/adb start-server, restart phone/computer doesn't work for me. On the device authorize dialog never appears (but I remember that dialog appeared before reinstallation). I have no idea how to force this authorize dialog to display. There is no abd_key.pub file in .android directory.
When i try read cpu info DDMS says:

[2014-04-15 12:47:06 - DDMS] device unauthorized. Please check the confirmation dialog on your device.


Any ideas? Is it possible to generate keys manually without confirmation dialog?

USB Connection


Wireless Connection

A:It's likely that the device is no longer authorized on ADB for whatever reason.

1. Check if authorized:

<ANDROID_SDK_HOME>\\platform-tools>adb devices
List of devices attached
4df798d76f98cf6d        unauthorized


2. Revoke USB Debugging on phone

If the device is shown as unauthorized, go to the developer options on the phone and click "Revoke USB debugging authorization" (tested with JellyBean & Samsung GalaxyIII).

3. Restart ADB Server:

Then restarted adb server

adb kill-server
adb start-server


4. Reconnect the device

The device will ask if you are agree to connect the computer id.
You need to confirm it.

5. Now Check the device

It is now authorized!

adb devices
<ANDROID_SDK_HOME>\\platform-tools>adb devices
List of devices attached
4df798d76f98cf6d        device
