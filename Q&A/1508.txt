Q:In an given Android activity, I would like to start a new activity for the user at some point. Once they leave the first activity and arrive at the second, the first activity is stale and I want to remove it completely so it can not be accessed again from the back button.

How is the best way to accomplish this? How do I kill or destroy this activity immediately after the user has launched the new activity?

A:You just need to call finish()

Intent intent = new Intent(this, NextActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
finish();
