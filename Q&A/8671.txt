Q:Well, every marker on my application will represent a user, so I need to identify that user when I click the info window to get its data from the Internet, and I can't make it identify them by name for obvious reasons. Is it possible to add an extra attribute to a marker object? thanks!

A:You could make a HashMap<Marker, User>
