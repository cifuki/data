Q:I've created a \\res\\drawable-xhdpi resource folder to prepare for the hi-res devices, but the developer.android.com site doesn't provide guidelines for the icon sizes for this resoulution. What should I use as the the size of a xhdpi icon?

A:mdpi means ~160dpi, xhdpi means ~320dpi.

So, as an mdpi icon is 48x48px --> xhdpi icon is 96x96px
