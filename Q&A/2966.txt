Q:This is confusing me:

As far as I have read, a view with setVisibility(View.GONE); should not receive any more touch- or click events.
My layout has two parts, which will be visible or gone so that only one of them is visible and usable at a time but View.GONE doesn't do the trick.
I can't see the GONE view, as expected, but it still reacts to onClick (and consumes the event the other view should get).

Can you help me?

Maybe of interest:
When I start my project one view is GONE, the other visible. This time it will work as expected (the GONE view is basically ignored), but after setting View.GONE through the code it'll stop working.

A:Do you maybe use animations to show/hide the views? I get this behaviour when I use animations that have android:fillEnabled="true" android:fillAfter="true"
Don't understand it, and seems like a bug - if I use animations without fillEnabled/fillAfter, all works as expected...
