Q:I am displaying a table of values in my android application, and would like the columns to be distributed evenly in terms of size , instead of sizing according to content. 

Been playing around with stretchColumns but couldn't manage to figure out the right combination, Any Ideas?

A:I had the same problem - I always only entered one number in android:stretchColumns, but you have to enter all columns that should be stretched. So if you have three columns, you have to write:

android:stretchColumns="0,1,2"


Or write:

android:stretchColumns="*"


Then all columns will have the same size. As a reminder, android:stretchColumns is an attribute for the TableLayout element.
