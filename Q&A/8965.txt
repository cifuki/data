Q:I want to find the difference between two Calendar objects in number of days if there is date change like If clock ticked from 23:59-0:00 there should be a day difference.

i wrote this 

public static int daysBetween(Calendar startDate, Calendar endDate) {  
    return Math.abs(startDate.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)-endDate.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH));  
} 


but its not working as it only gives difference between days if there is month difference its worthless.

A:In Java 8 and later, we could simply use the java.time classes.

hoursBetween = ChronoUnit.HOURS.between(calendarObj.toInstant(), calendarObj.toInstant());

daysBetween = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(calendarObj.toInstant(), calendarObj.toInstant());
