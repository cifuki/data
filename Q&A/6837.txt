Q:I'm working at an app, and I'm trying to make a gmail like "To" field, which has blocks inside which cannot be edited once added, but just removed entirely (like in the attached image). If it can have an image too, that would be perfect.

A:This technique -- referred to as "chips" -- is discussed by Roman Nurik in a Google+ post. He, in turn, points to Macarse's answer here on StackOverflow. They, in turn, point to the implementation of this UI that you see in the stock messaging client.
