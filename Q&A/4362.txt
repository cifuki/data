Q:When I try to build an android project with gradle with this command :

> gradlew clean build assembleRelease


It gives me this error : 

Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.  
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.  
Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.  
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.


I can build this project and make the APK in Studio. 

Is there a way to configure Gradle to make a compilation ignoring Xlint notifications ?

OR, can I use other parameters, to make the release from command-line with gradle/gradlew ?

A:It's a nice warning, not an error. To see the complete lint report you can add these lines to build.gradle:

allprojects {
    tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
        options.compilerArgs << "-Xlint:deprecation"
    }
}


If you really want to get rid of those warnings:


Don't use deprecated API
Use @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
