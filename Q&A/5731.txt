Q:I have a simple application which basically consists of a line of buttons and a ListView of items to be selected and manipulated.  There might be only one item in the list or a few.  However, I would prefer if the list would populate from the bottom of the ListView, since the way most people hold their phones makes it easier to select items closer to the bottom of the screen.  Is this possible?

A:You can have the ListView stack its items from the bottom up using a simple XML property
under the xml - 

<ListView 
    android:stackFromBottom="true"
...
></ListView>
