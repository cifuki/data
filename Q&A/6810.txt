Q:When I open my AVD Manager from Android Studio (version 2.1 Preview 1), I am presented with a banner on my AVD list which reads:

System image update is available       (link:)"Update System Images"

When I click on the "Update System Images" link, I am presented with the following mysterious error message:

**Packages Unavailable**

 The following packages are not available:
    - Package id system-images;android-MNC;default;x86_64
    - Package id system-images;android-MNC;default;x86


I don't know what this means or how to resolve it. Web searches have been fruitless. Any ideas?

Here is what I am seeing:


In response to Zayin, here is what I see when I look for the MNC system images. There doesn't appear to even be an option for installing them.

A:I had the same error before. Just open the package manager and delete/uninstall everything for Android M (API 22 MNC Preview). Marshmallow is already out anyway.

You may have to restart Android Studio afterward cause it caches that check.

The M release has been removed from the packages for some reason after the Marshmallow release and I think that error means he can't find the upgrade to those images. When you wipe them out it stop complaining and you do not see them anymore on the list of packages.

In Android Studio:


Open SDK Manager. To do that, go to Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Android SDK
Make sure you are in the SDK Platform tab
Uncheck Android M (API 22, MNC Preview)
Click "OK"
