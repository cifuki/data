Q:I just uploaded my application in the market, but I'm not able to purchase it (it's a pay app).

I saw here that it seems to be made by design, but then why the error message is Server Error try again ?

Is there a way to bypass that ?

A:Do you have an Android Developer Phone?  If so, you can't purchase your own app by design.  Since ADPs are unlocked, there's nothing preventing an ADP from easily pirating any app it downloads, so they are purposely cut off from downloading paid apps.
