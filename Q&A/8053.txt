Q:Here's the deal. I have an application with three tabs. Through various interactions with the items in the tabs I end up launching other activities. The client has reviewed this and would like the activities launched "within" the tabs, so the tabs remain visible and if the user clicks the tab it goes back to the original activity defined in the setContent function. Is this possible and how would I go about this from other activities? (ie the child activities, not the one that defines the TabHost and has access to call setContent)?

A:It is possible to launch activities within tabs. Therefore set the tabspec content to an ActivityGroup instead of a regular Activity.

tabHost.addTab(tabHost.newTabSpec("Tab")
                .setIndicator("Tab")
                .setContent(new Intent(this, YourActivityGROUP.class)
                 .addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP)));


From within that ActivityGroup you can then start another Activity like this that only updates the contentview of the tab you're in.

class YourActivityGROUP extends ActivityGroup{

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

      //you van get the local activitymanager to start the new activity

      View view = getLocalActivityManager()
                                .startActivity("ReferenceName", new
      Intent(this,YourActivity.class)
                                .addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP))
                                .getDecorView();
       this.setContentView(view);

   }
}
