Q:I wish to generate an application signature for my app which will later be integrated with Facebook. In one of Facebook's tutorials, I found this command:

keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64


In the tutorial, it says that by running this cmd, my process of generating the signature will start.

However, this command gives an error:

openssl is not recognized as an internal or external command


How can I get rid of this?

A:Well at the place of openssl ... you have to put actually the path to your openssl folder that you have downloaded. Your actual command should look like:

keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | "C:\\Users\\abc\\openssl\\bin\\openssl.exe" sha1 -binary | "C:\\Users\\abc\\openssl\\bin\\openssl.exe" base64


Remember, path that you will enter will be the path where you have installed the openssl...hope this helps..:-)

Edit:

you can download openssl for windows 32 and 64 bit from the respective links below:

OpenSSL for 64 Bits 

OpenSSL for 32 Bits
