Q:I'm having a heck of a time figuring out what data is coming to my methods through Intent/Bundles. I've tried adding break points to inspect the data, but I don't see anything. Perhaps because it's a Parcelable I can't manually read it in Eclipse.  

For instance, a onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) for a Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK, ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI). How do I know what data is available? Notice, I'm not ask for WHAT data is available but how the heck do I figure it out so I can apply the same idea to any Bundle/Intent from the Android framework? Perhaps it's a simple as looking at the docs, but I don't see a full listing of the data and I can't see it in Eclipse. So I'm at a lost.

A:Bundle.keySet() gives you a list of all keys in the bundle. That said, typically you just expect certain keys and query them, but keySet() is used to examine bundles you get from somewhere.
