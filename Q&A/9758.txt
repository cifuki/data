Q:What is the best tool for generating UML diagrams from Java source files in Android Studio? Are there any plugins similar to ObjectAid in Android Studio.

There is no Visual Paradigm EE shown as described http://www.visual-paradigm.com/support/documents/vpuserguide/2381/2385/66578_creatingauml.html

A:Try Code Iris. You can install it in Android Studio as a plugin.

Open Android Studio Settings: File -> Settings. Look for Plugins, then hit "Browse repositories..." and type "Code Iris". Install and restart your IDE.

There is another plugin that could be interesting too, which is PlantUML. You may need to install Graphviz in order to make it work.


Code Iris allows to export your diagram into a json file.
PlantUML allows to save your diagram as a PNG file.


Hope it helps.
