Q:Which XMPP library would be the best choice nowadays for Android development?


I've been using the patched Smack
library as is
suggested in many other questions
here in SO. However, that's a patched version of
the Smack API from two years ago. And
although it generally works well I'm
exploring any other, more recent
options.
I've been looking at the official
Smack API and after a little
research, it seems it might work just
fine nowadays (although I have not
tried it yet in a real application).
There's also another solution I came
across, Beem's aSMACK library.
Beem is a fairly new XMPP client for
android and from what I understand
they are using their own patched
version of aSMACK.
Finally, there's aSMACK but that
too hasn't been updated for quite
some time (as the site suggests).


Do you have any other suggestions or can you explain why I should choose one of the above over the rest?

Smack is a open-source XMPP client library. Since version 4.1 it runs natively on Android. For more information have a look at the "Smack 4.1 Readme" and see the Smack project page at Ignite Realtime. aSmack is obsolete and deprecated in favor of Smack 4.1.
