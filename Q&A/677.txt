Q:I need help in creating libs in Android Studio for my project, mine are not auto generated.

When I want to create a folder, it gives me lots of options, like AIDL, Assets, JNI, Java, Java Resources, Renderscripts and Res folders. I chose Res and added a libs folder but it didn't show up on my file structure on the left.

Can anyone help me?

I wanted to add a JAR file but I can't find libs to put in.

A:The solution for me was very simple (after 10 hours of searching).
Above where your folders are there is a combobox that says "android"
click it and choose "Project".
