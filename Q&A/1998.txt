Q:I'm currently trying to get the ES6 react-native-webpack-server running
on an Android emulator. The difference is I've upgraded my package.json and build.grade to use react 0.18.0, and am getting this error on boot. As far as I'm aware AppRegistry is imported correctly. Even if I were to comment out the code this error still comes up. This does work on iOS without issue. 

What am I doing wrong?

EDIT: After trying other boilerplates that do support 0.18.0, I'm still coming across the same issue.

A:i just upgraded to react-native 0.18.1 today tough having some peer dependencies issues with 0.19.0-rc pre-release version.

Back to your question, what I did was


cd android
sudo ./gradlew clean


then back to the working directory and run
react-native run-android

you should restart your npm too after that upgrade.

hope this works for you.
