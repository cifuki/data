Q:I am about to jump into Phonegap and realize that it doesn't have an IDE of its own. I know that I could use Eclipse to create Android-centric Phonegap apps, but what about the iOS and perhaps Windows Phone and perhaps Blackberry "versions" - can Eclipse be used for all of it? What do most Phonegappers use as an IDE?

Does PhoneGap Build make it possible to do it all in Eclipse, and then throw it up to the cloud for the iOS, etc., builds?

A:I'm currently using intel-xdk and it's been great so far. It has the ripple emulator embedded which is great to test your app quickly.
