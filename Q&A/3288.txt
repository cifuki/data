  Which programming languages can I use on Android Dalvik?  




Mostly, Android applications are written in Java. But i heard that its also possible to use Scala or some other languages. And I also read that it's possible to include native C/C++ code.

Is there a refernce/list available that shows which languages can be used?

A:At launch, Java was the only officially supported programming language for building distributable third-party Android software.
Android Native Development Kit (Android NDK) which will allow developers to build Android software components with C and C++.
In addition to delivering support for native code, Google is also extending Android to support popular dynamic scripting languages. Earlier this month, Google launched  the  Android Scripting Environment (ASE)  which allows third-party developers to build simple Android applications with perl, JRuby, Python, LUA and BeanShell. For having idea and usage of ASE, refer this Example link.
 Scala  is also supported. For having examples of Scala, refer these  Example link-1 ,   Example link-2 ,  Example link-3 .
Just now i have referred one  Article Here  in which i found some useful information as follows:


programming language is Java but bridges from other languages exist (C# .net - Mono, etc).
can run script languages like LUA, Perl, Python, BeanShell, etc.


I have read 2nd article at Google Releases 'Simple' Android Programming Language . For example of this, refer this .  
Just now (2 Aug 2010) i have read an article which describes regarding "Frink Programming language and Calculating Tool for Android", refer this links  Link-1 ,  Link-2 
On 4-Aug-2010, i have found Regarding RenderScript. Basically, It is said to be a C-like language for high performance graphics programming, which helps you easily write efficient Visual effects and animations in your Android Applications. Its not released yet as it isn't finished.
