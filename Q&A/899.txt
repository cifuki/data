Q:What is the proper way to set a timer in android in order to kick off a task (a function that I create which does not change the UI)? 
Use this the Java way:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Timer.html

Or there is a better way in android (android's handler)?

A:Standard Java way to use timers via java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask works fine in Android, but you should be aware that this method creates a new thread.

You may consider using the very convenient Handler class (android.os.Handler) and send messages to the handler via sendMessageAtTime(android.os.Message, long) or sendMessageDelayed(android.os.Message, long). Once you receive a message, you can run desired tasks. Second option would be to create a Runnable object and schedule it via Handler's functions postAtTime(java.lang.Runnable, long) or postDelayed(java.lang.Runnable, long).
