Q:I currently have a view in my Android app and the view is playing a frame animation.  I want to animate the view to increase its size to 150%.  When I apply a scale animation to it, and the scale animation is completed, I want the view to stay at that new size for the rest of the activity's life cycle.  Unfortunately right now when the scale up animation is complete, the view snaps back to the original size.  How can I get it to keep the new animated tranformation?

I'm using 

myView.startAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(mContext,R.anim.scaleUp150));


Thanks!

A:Make sure you add below attributes to the root element in your animation xml:

android:fillAfter="true" 
android:fillEnabled="true"
