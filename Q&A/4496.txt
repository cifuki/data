Q:Edit: Android now supports in-app billing!

Original question:

It looks like Android won't natively support in-app purchases for a while, and when it does there might be a huge user base with devices that don't support them.

What's the best way to implement iPhone-like (additional content or services) in-app purchases in Android using the Android Market if possible? 

The solution should consider in particular: 


For all kinds of in-app purchases: Android Market's 24-hour cancellation policy
For consumables/non-consumables: storage of additional content (ie: use precious application memory to avoid piracy, or use SD card to avoid bloating application memory)


Thanks!

A:This has changed as of today! There is now an example on the Android Developer site here: https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_overview
