I want to create my app's shortcut/launcher icon on the homescreen as soon as I install my app  (even before I start it). Is that possible? How might I do that?

A:NOTE: This answer is now wrong. See, for instance, Robin's answer for a way to do this.



As far as I know, an app cannot force itself onto the home screen. It gets added to the app list that the launcher app maintains, but the home screen is generally under user control. Giving apps the ability to clutter up the home screen would be an open invitation for abuse.
