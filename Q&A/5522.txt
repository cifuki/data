Q:I'm referring to the camera application that is already installed on my G1, not the camera API source code.

How do I get the source code?

A:You will need to clone the project from the Android repository using git.

The project URL is:


  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Camera.git


You can clone the project like this:

git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Camera.git


The source code will be in the directory Camera.

This link will tell you how to download all the sources.

If you need help with using git then checkout git's documentation section.
