Q:I'm using the below code to bind "click" or "touchstart" events (using jQuery's on(eventType, function() { ... })).

var what = (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)) ? 'touchstart' : 'click';


Later on:

$foo.on(what, function() { ... });


... which works great for iPad and "everything else", but I'm concerned that the above code has "iPad tunnel vision"...

My question(s):

Do all other devices (for example, Android tablets) have similarly named "touchstart" events? If so, how can I improve the above code so that I can account for those event types?

In other words, how can I account for a wider range of touch devices in above code (not just iPad)?



EDIT #1

What do you folks think about this:

var foo = ('ontouchstart' in window) ? 'touchstart' : ((window.DocumentTouch && document instanceof DocumentTouch) ? 'tap' : 'click');


Note: Most of the above logic is from Modernizr here.

The above appears to work for Firefox/iPad... I don't have much else to test on at this time.

What I like about the above is that I'm not UA sniffing. :)

Is tap a good default for all other touch devices?



EDIT #2

Some interesting information here, which links to this:

Creating Fast Buttons for Mobile Web Applications

Not a direct answer really, but gives a lot of details of the situation devs face when facing click-related events for multiple platforms and devices.



EDIT #3

Some good info here too:


  Android and iPhone touch events
  
  Android and iPhone versions of WebKit have some touch events in common:

touchstart - triggered when a touch is initiated. Mouse equivalent - mouseDown
touchmove - triggered when a touch moves. Mouse equivalent - mouseMove
touchend - triggered when a touch ends. Mouse equivalent - mouseUp. This one is a bit special on the iPhone - see below
touchcancel - bit of a mystery



After reading that, I think I'll change the code above to this:

var foo = (('ontouchstart' in window) || (window.DocumentTouch && document instanceof DocumentTouch)) ? 'touchstart' : 'click';


When I first asked my question - not having access to anything other than an iPad/iPhone - I assumed touchstart was an iOS-specific event; it now looks like touchstart and click will cover most, if not all, of the bases for touch devices.



August 2014 update:

If it's of any help, I've posted some utility classes here:


mhulse / no-x.js:


  [no-js] [no-touch] JavaScript utilities to put in  of HTML templates that will add js or touch classes for use in CSS and/or JS.

A:Both iOS and Android have touch events, but Windows uses MSPointer events in IE. If you want a cross-device solution, try pointer.js or learn from it:
