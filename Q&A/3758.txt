Q:Using the latest version of Android Studio.

Once you type the function name and open brackets, AS would automatically display hint with variable type and name (which is really handy). But sometimes it would just disappear.

Does anyone know the keymap (shortcut) that would trigger it to pop again? (haven't found one in AS options, may be I missed one). In particular, I'd like to know the name of the corresponding shortcut so that I can find it through the Preferences screen and update the assigned keys if necessary.

A:The command name is "Parameter Info".

On Mac, it's assigned to Command+P by default.

On Windows, it's assigned to Ctrl+P by default.
