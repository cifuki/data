Q:I am creating a custom DialogFragment that is displayed underneath the actionbar. So far everything works great. The layout parameters for dialog fragment are match_parent for width and wrap_content for height. 

I have tried every solution including setting the layout parameters .width and by getting Display size and removing the themes. However no matter what there is a small amount of space on left, right and top side of the dialog that is invisible. I need to know how to remove this space so it actually matches the width of the screen and hopefully gets rid of the top padding as well.

A:I figured it out using custom dialog theme. windowIsFloating true will get rid of the background but will add some extra space underneath the background as a background. In which case you can use windowBackground @null to erase it.

<style name="CustomDialog" parent="@android:style/Theme.Holo.Light" >
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@null</item>
    <item name="android:windowIsFloating">true</item>
</style


Thank you to Raghunandan who gave me the link that includes all style attributes. It took me a while but I went through that file and found very interesting elements. Definitely have a look at the link posted below to explore theme styles.
