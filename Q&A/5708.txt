Q:I have an Android project where I should make Apples fall. The apples are painted in a Rect. So I created a function that change the Rect position and repaint. Here's my function :

private void updateApplesPosition() {
    for(Rect rect:fallingDownFruitsList)
        rect.set(rect.left, rect.top +10, rect.right, rect.bottom +10);
}


I have a problem : the Apples don't fall but go from right to left. To make the apples fall I changed the code by this :

private void updateApplesPosition() {
    for(Rect rect:fallingDownFruitsList)
        rect.set(rect.left+10, rect.top, rect.right+10, rect.bottom);
}
