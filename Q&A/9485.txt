Q:I need to get root access for rooted devices, and I was wondering how I can request root access. I need the access for the file system. Thanks a lot.

A:Just exec the command su and within that Process you have root priviliges:

Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("su");


See this blog post for full example.
