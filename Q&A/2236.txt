Q:I am getting -bash: react-native: command not found error while creating react-native project.

Below are the additional info

1. brew --version
   homebrew 0.9.9
2  brew info watchman
   watchman `enter code here`stable 4.50
   /usr/local/Cellar/watchman/4.4.0
3. brew info flow
   stable 0.24.1
   /usr/local/Cellar/flow/0.24.1
4. brew info node
   stable 6.1.0
   /usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0
5. npm -version
   3.8.6
6. echo $PATH
/Users/Ashok/.rbenv/shims:/Users/Ashok/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin


I tried suggested steps from the below link but still i am getting same error.


react-native-command-not-found


I don't have any "npm" directory which they have specified in the solution 

Ashoks-MacBook-Pro:share Ashok$ ls
aclocal     doc     info        ruby-build  zsh
autoconf    emacs       man     systemtap


But i found npm file exist in below location.

/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0/etc/bash_completion.d


I uninstalled react-native and installed again but still i am facing same issue.

A:After adding right path to the PATH variable issue is resolved.

Below are the steps to find the right path.

1. Enter: npm install -g react-native-cli
output: /usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0/libexec/npm/bin/react-native ->/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0/libexec/npm/lib/node_modules/react-native-cli/index.js/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0/libexec/npm/lib
\xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 react-native-cli@0.2.0 


from above output you can clearly see the path: /usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0/libexec/npm/bin/react-native

export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.1.0/libexec/npm/bin:$PATH"

react-native init appName

cd appName

react-native run-ios


if you getting xcrun: error: unable to find utility "simctl" at this stage you can reslove using below steps

XCode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Command Line Tools -> Choose Xcode 7.2.1

You can find original solution from xcrun unable to find simctl

Thanks to @fbozo

That's It!!!
