A:Method 1

You can use Android-Debug-Database, and you can CRUD of your data from a browser, and then you can see your Preference data from a browser.

Method 2

If you don't want to use from Browser and you have to check other files,need to check your data changes, use a Genymotion Emulator.So you have to root your emulator.Try to Root your emulator, plz see in https://stackoverflow.com/a/44039429/2772552.
Let me know if you are not OK.
