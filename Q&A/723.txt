A:Okay, not that hard as there are several methods to do this. I assume you want to put the current date & time into a TextView.

String currentDateTimeString = DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance().format(new Date());

// textView is the TextView view that should display it
textView.setText(currentDateTimeString);


There is more to read in the documentation that can easily be found here
. There you'll find more information on how to change the format used for conversion.
