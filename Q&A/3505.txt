Q:I'm using the latest version of android studio (3.0), along with latest build tools (27) and similar API level.

The layout does not get rendered in the design tab and it's causing a lot of trouble especially that I'm using coordinator layout.

How do I get around this problem?

A:I solved this rendering problem by simply inserting this line into the application theme (the app theme is usually placed in styles.xml).

[SDK 28]

<style name="AppTheme">
  <item name="coordinatorLayoutStyle">@style/Widget.Support.CoordinatorLayout</item>
</style>




[SDK 27]

<style name="AppTheme">
  <item name="coordinatorLayoutStyle">@style/Widget.Design.CoordinatorLayout</item>
</style>





  As suggested by @Chris. If the IDE does not find the CoordinatorLayout in Widget.Support or Widget.Design,  just start typing "CoordinatorLayout" and it should give you some options.
