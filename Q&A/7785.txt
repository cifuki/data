A:Here are my answers!


  What is the difference between Normal ProgressBar and
  ContentLoadingProgressbar?


ContentLoadingProgressbar waits a minimum time to be dismissed before showing using hide() like with-in 0.5 seconds.So even the show() gets called this can be dismissed before it appear on the screen.


  What is the practical usage of ContentLoadingProgressBar


It prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with "naive" implementations.


  Can we show/hide this progressbar according to our requirement


Yes


  How can I custom style this progressBar


<android.support.v4.widget.ContentLoadingProgressBar
        android:id="@+id/address_looking_up"
        style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleLarge"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
        android:visibility="visible" />


replace style with android:theme https://stackoverflow.com/a/38282149/5188159
