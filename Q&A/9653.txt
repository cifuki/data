Q:I am presently using the following piece of code to load in images as drawable objects form a URL.

Drawable drawable_from_url(String url, String src_name) 
throws java.net.MalformedURLException, java.io.IOException {
        return Drawable.createFromStream(((java.io.InputStream)new java.net.URL(url).getContent()), src_name);

}


This code works exactly as wanted, but there appears to be compatibility problems with it. In version 1.5, it throws a FileNotFoundException when I give it a URL. In 2.2, given the exact same URL, it works fine. The following URL is a sample input I am giving this function.

How would I load in images in a way that is compatible across the board from a URL?

A:Bitmap is not a Drawable. If you really need a Drawable do this:

public static Drawable drawableFromUrl(String url) throws IOException {
    Bitmap x;

    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(url).openConnection();
    connection.connect();
    InputStream input = connection.getInputStream();

    x = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(input);
    return new BitmapDrawable(Resources.getSystem(), x);
}
