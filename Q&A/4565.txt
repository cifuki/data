Q:Well, I have a RecyclerView with an adapter and everything works great. The items in the ArrayList dataset are being updated periodically. So the items and their elements as well as their position in the list change. This is achieved by simple sorting and manually calling these methods, whenever things happen:

// swapping two items
Collections.swap(items, i, j);
itemsAdapter.notifyItemMoved(i, j);

// adding a new one
itemAdapter.notifyItemInserted(items.size());

// when updating valus
itemAdapter.notifyItemChanged(i);


The latter of which, is the cause of my misery. Every time an item is updated, a little "blink" animation is triggered. 

I found a couple of solutions for this:

// disabling all animations
recyclerView.getItemAnimator().setSupportsChangeAnimations(false);

// or

// setting the animation duration to zero,
recyclerView.getItemAnimator().setChangeDuration(0);


But both of these kill the animations when items move (being swapped). I just want to override the one animation and keep all of this magic. Is there a way of doing this? And if it's overriding ItemAnimator, does anyone have a simple example?

Thanks in advance!

A:There is a dedicated method to disable just item changed animations:

((SimpleItemAnimator) myRecyclerView.getItemAnimator()).setSupportsChangeAnimations(false);
