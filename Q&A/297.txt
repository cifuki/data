Q:I have implemented a ListView in my Android application.  I bind to this ListView using a custom subclass of the ArrayAdapter class.  Inside the overridden ArrayAdapter.getView(...) method, I assign an OnClickListener.  In the onClick method of the OnClickListener, I want to launch a new activity.  I get the exception:

Calling startActivity() from outside of an Activity  context requires the  
FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag. Is this really what you want?


How can I get the Context that the ListView(the current Activity) is working under?

A:Either 


cache the Context object via constructor in your adapter, or
get it from your view.


Or as a last resort,


add  - FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag to your intent:


_

myIntent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);


Edit - i would avoid setting flags as it will interfere with normal flow of event and history stack.
