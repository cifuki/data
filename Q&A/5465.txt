Q:I've previously had success attaching the Android Source to Eclipse by following Finn Johnsen's instructions here.

However this approach seems to have stopped working:

samuel-josephs-computer-4:android-sources samueljoseph$ git checkout origin/froyo-release
Previous HEAD position was 1de4a2c... am 62619392: Merge "Fix leak when keylock is recreated."
HEAD is now at adba66b... This class no longer exists.


There was a more recent blog here which had some pre-organized source for Eclair, but nothing since.  

There are also some StackOverflow posts from 2008 (older than both the above), e.g. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3182904/attaching-java-source-to-android-projects-in-eclipse.

What is the current guidance for accomplishing this?

A:There is an Eclipse plugin called Android Sources that installs the sources up through Gingerbread. I haven't tried it recently.
