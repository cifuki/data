Q:I am developing an app and in the manifest I have:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"></uses-permission>


When I click on the button to execute this code:

Intent intentcall = new Intent();
intentcall.setAction(Intent.ACTION_CALL);
intentcall.setData(Uri.parse("tel:" + phonenumber)); // set the Uri
startActivity(intentcall);


It will run fine on phones, and on tablets it pops up with a display where you can view or add the number to contacts. However, if I keep the permission in the manifest, it isn't available for tablets in the market. How can I keep the code behavior and still have it display in the market for tablets as well as phones?

A:Regarding "uses-feature" and it crashing - are you checking that telephony is available before actually making the call?  It might be you need to do that extra step for the case when the app is on tablets.  All you are saying in the manifest is that the feature is not required.  It probably relies on you to actually implement the logic around that.
