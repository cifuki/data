Q:I'm connecting a webcam to my emulator by setting the front camera to "webcam0" in the AVD Manager.  When I start the emulator's camera application, I get the error

CameraService::connect X (pid 702) rejected (invalid cameraId 0).


Here's the relevant portion of the Android source code:

sp<ICamera> CameraService::connect(
    const sp<ICameraClient>& cameraClient, int cameraId) {

    int callingPid = getCallingPid();

    [...]

    if (cameraId < 0 || cameraId >= mNumberOfCameras) {
        LOGE("CameraService::connect X (pid %d) rejected (invalid cameraId %d).",
            callingPid, cameraId);
        return NULL;
    }

    [...]
}


The webcam has been correctly assigned an ID of 0 because there's only 1 camera. However, mNumberOfCameras is presumably still 0.  This means that the camera is being registered by the emulator, but it hasn't bothered to update the number of connected cameras.  

How can I connect a webcam so that it will be properly recognized by the emulator?

Edit: the command emulator -webcam-list -avd <name of your AVD> in \\android-sdks\\tools gives the result:

List of web cameras connected to the computer:
Camera `webcam0` is connected to device `AndroidEmulatorVC0` on channel 0 using pixel format `BGR4`


When I launch the webcam from Eclipse's AVD manager or using emulator -camera-front webcam0 -avd <name of your AVD>, I get the following window: 



Edit 2: This seems to be a bug in the emulator. The suggested answer tells you what to do to set up the camera, but doesn't solve the problem for me.  I ultimately solved it by using a laptop with a built-in webcam.  Perhaps another USB webcam might have worked as well.
