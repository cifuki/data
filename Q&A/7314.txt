Q:I see quite a few good old useful methods or even entire classes being "deprecated and obsolete". 

But code that used to call those methods continues to work. So, what does this mean to me, as an Android applications developer?


Continue using this method as long as I want, because newer SDKs
will always remain backward compatible.
It will work as long as I build for older targets (e.g. API 8), but
if I build from API 14 up, the compiler will refuse to complete
the build.
Both (1) and (2)
Other?


This is especially confusing when no alternatives are provided, as in the case of WebView.PictureListener.html#onNewPicture.

A:It usually means that there's either a better way of doing things or that the deprecated functionality had some irreparable flaw and should be avoided. You can usually keep using deprecated methods, but you are advised to either switch to some new API (in the first case) or find some other way of doing what you want (in the second).

Regarding onNewPicture in particular, the entire PictureListener interface is deprecated. There's no sign of what, if anything, is supposed to replace it. A comment by @CommonsWare in this thread is food for thought:


  It is conceivable that upstream changes in WebKit are driving the deprecation and that support for PictureListener might be totally lost in some future release.
