Q:I can't attach Android Studio's debugger to my debuggable application process. Anyone else had this issue? Basically I can't get my app listed in Choose Process dialog. 

I'm selecting Attach debugger to Android process:



And then, here's how Process selection dialog from Android Studio looks like:



Any ideas why my app is not shown in the Choose Process list?

Although, DDMS sees my app in Devices | logcat list:



Android Monitor also sees the app in Devices list:



I've tried these actions:


Restarting MacBook 
Restarting devices: tried with Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 (4.3) and Samsung Galaxy S4 (4.4.2)
Reenabling Settings->Developer Options on the devices
Reenabling Settings->Developer Options->USB debugging on the devices
Restarting adb by running adb kill-server and adb start-server
Reconnecting device from macbook and/or plugging to another USB port
Launching Genymotion virtual device on macbook
restarting in TCP mode port: 5555 by running adb tcpip 5555 and then connecting to it with adb connect 192.168.1.87
Waiting more&Restart when got this error saying ADB not responding. You can wait more, or kill "adb" process manually and click 'Restart' Errors in ADB: ddms: '$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb,start-server' failed -- run manually if necessary Error screenshot


Update:

What I've noticed is that device appears multiple times in the Android DDMS->Devices | logcat list. If I choose 1st device from the list, it shows, there's No debuggable applications, but I select last device (4th in the screenshot) I see my debuggable application. See screenshots: 1st and 4th. Although, even there's only 1 device in the list and showing debuggable device and application, process still does not appear in the Choose Process dialog.

A:So finally I got it working, by:

Checking 'Show all processes' checkbox!


BUT as you see in the question, checkbox was on at the beginning, so there were multiple issues.

To summarize, these are other actions to be done:


Kill all adb processes (use ps -x | grep adb and kill -9 [process id])
adb start-server in terminal
Reconnect device 
adb devices (to make sure device is connected successfully)
Make sure Android DDMS Devices | logcat shows your app and only one device is listed.
Check Show all processes checkbox. See screenshot
