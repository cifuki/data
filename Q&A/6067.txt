A:DataBinding class will be generated based on your xml file name. It is clearly mentioned in doc you are following.


  By default, a Binding class will be generated based on the name of the layout file, converting it to Pascal case and suffixing \xe2\x80\x9cBinding\xe2\x80\x9d to it. The above layout file was main_activity.xml so the generate class was
  MainActivityBinding


If your xml name is activity_main.xml than DataBinding class name will be ActivityMainBinding.

If your xml name is main_activity.xml than DataBinding class name will be MainActivityBinding.

Dont forget to clean and build project once

you can follow this tutorial for more about DataBinding
