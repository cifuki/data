Q:In a Obj-C iOS app I can use #if (TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR) to write simulator-only code.

In react native I can use:

if (__DEV__) {
 .. do something special
}


.. to detect development mode.  

We can use Platform.OS === 'ios' to detect the platform (Android/iOS).
See here for more info Platform Docs

But how do we detect if the app is running in the simulator?

The reason I ask is that my app uses the camera to scan barcodes, and this isn't supported in the iOS Simulator.

A:You can do this pretty easily with react-native-device-info, like so:

import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info'

isSimulator() {
  return DeviceInfo.isEmulator();
},
