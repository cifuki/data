Q:I have a ViewPager, and I'd like to get the current selected and visible view, not a position. 


getChildAt(getCurrentItem) returns wrong View
This works not all the time. Sometimes returns null, sometimes just returns wrong View.

@Override
public void setUserVisibleHint(boolean isVisibleToUser) {
    super.setUserVisibleHint(isVisibleToUser);

    if (isVisibleToUser == true) { 
        mFocusedListView = ListView; 
    }
}

PageListener on ViewPager with getChildAt() also not working, not giving me the correct View every time. 


How can i get current visible View?

View view = MyActivity.mViewPager.getChildAt(MyActivity.mViewPager.getCurrentItem()).getRootView();
ListView listview = (ListView) view.findViewById(R.id.ListViewItems);

A:I've figured it out. What I did was to call setTag() with a name to all Views/ListViews, and just call findViewWithTag(mytag), mytag being the tag.

Unfortunately, there's no other way to solve this.
