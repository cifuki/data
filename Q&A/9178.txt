Q:I have updated to Android Studio 3.1 and it doesn't show the details of error during compile time.
Suppose if I miss a semicolon somewhere or I haven't implemented a method of an interface, then it gives me this error all the time, but doesn't tell me what or where the error occurred!
All error details were perfectly shown in Studio 3.0. How do I see them in 3.1?

This is the message that I get every time an error occurs.

Compilation error. See log for more details

A:There is a toggle button just below the build button that will show the verbose build logs. Tap that and you should be able to see errors like before AS 3.1.
