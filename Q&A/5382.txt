Q:The setup

I have an activity whose contentView is an instance of a DrawerLayout, which has a navigation drawer with a drawer indicator displayed in the action bar. The activity contains a Fragment, let's call it ListFragment, which contains a list of options. When an option is clicked, I replace the ListFragment with a DetailFragment.



At this point, I would like to display an "up" navigation option instead of the navigation drawer indicator. I'm able to display the "up" icon if I disable the drawer indicator by calling mDrawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(false), but this only removes the drawer icon--it does not remove the functionality--that is, when I click the caret, the navigation drawer is still opened.

Additionally, in these subviews, I would like to disable the opening of the drawer by dragging from the edge of the screen. I have tried doing this by calling setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED) but it doesn't seem to have disabled this functionality.

I have tried extending the ActionBarDrawerToggle class to prevent opening the drawer when the indicator is clicked--however, all that happens is that the overriding action (the "up" navigation) is performed, but the drawer still opens.

I have also implemented the steps in Switching between Android Navigation Drawer image and Up caret when using fragments . It works insofar as displaying the caret goes, but despite overriding the up button functionality, the menu still opens (the app does navigate back--it just also opens the drawer).

Question

So, long story short: is there any (preferably clean and elegant, but at this point I'll go with hacky) way to achieve these things when my layout root is a DrawerLayout:


Replace the drawer indicator with an "up" caret (tentatively doable via mDrawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(false))
Prevent the drawer from opening when the caret is clicked, and instead override with my own "up" functionality
Prevent the drawer from opening when I drag from the edge of the screen.


Edit

All right, it looks like if I both override ActionBarDrawerToggle AND onOptionsItemSelected, the menu does not open when I click the caret. But it still opens if I drag from the edge. Help!

A:Short Code

public void setDrawerState(boolean isEnabled) {
    if ( isEnabled ) {
        mDrawerLayout.setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED);
        drawerToggle.onDrawerStateChanged(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED);
        drawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(true);
        drawerToggle.syncState();

    }
    else {
        mDrawerLayout.setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED);
        drawerToggle.onDrawerStateChanged(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED);
        drawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabled(false);
        drawerToggle.syncState();
    }
}
