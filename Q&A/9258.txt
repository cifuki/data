Q:I am trying to stop a service which is running as foreground service.

The current issue is that when I call stopService() the notification still stays.

So in my solution I have added a receiver which I am registering to inside the onCreate()

Inside the onReceive() method I call stopforeground(true) and it hides the notification.
And then stopself() to stop the service.

Inside the onDestroy() I unregistered the receiver.

Is there a more proper way to handle this? because stopService() simply doesn't work.

@Override
public void onDestroy(){
  unregisterReceiver(receiver);
  super.onDestroy();
}

A:From your activity call startService(intent) and pass it some data that will represent a key to stop the service.

From your service call stopForeground(true) and then stopSelf() right after it.
