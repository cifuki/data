Q:I was looking at a scheduling tutorial by Vogella. It mentions the Job Scheduler  API that was introduced in API 21 of Android. My question is can it be implemented in APIs lower than 21 (Lollipop) but not less than Android version 3 (Honeycomb)?

A:from now on (after I/O 2015), you can also use new GcmNetworkManager. How to use it and how it works is described here - https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/network-manager

It does a lot cool stuff like it persists your tasks trough reboots. On Lolipop it uses JobScheduler, on pre-Lolipop it uses it's own implementation.

EDIT:

An example code on how to use it : https://github.com/jacktech24/gcmnetworkmanager-android-example
