Q:Android 4.0 is now released. I have just updated my ADT plugin and downloaded the 4.0 SDK. But when I try to create an AVD for Android 4.0, Eclipse tells me 'Unable to find a 'userdata.img' file for ABI armeabi to copy into the AVD folder'.

I found d:\\android-sdk-windows\\platforms\\android-14 missing the 'images' folder which other versions have. This folder may have 'userdata.img' that create an AVD should have.

Where should I to get 'userdata.img', and how do I create an AVD for Android 4.0?

This is what you need to download in order to create an Android 4.0 virtual device:
