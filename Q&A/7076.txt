Q:I found this question very similar to what I need but I need chrome. Because of many reasons android webView (as I discussed here ) is not compatible with my application's requirements.

So are there any ways to Use Chrome as render engine for Android webview

A:This is coming as the default in Android 4.4 KitKat. See https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/webview/overview
