Q:I did try samples, demos from Google codes and other resources with WebView, but when i try to do it in my own code, it doesn't work for me.

I want to load myfile.html which i put in assets folder, and using:

private WebView myWebView;

myWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_assets/myfile.html");


On emulator shows error 


  The web page at file:///android_assets/myfile.html could not be
  loaded as: The requested file was not found.
  /android_assets/myfile.html


When i put that file to res/raw/ folder and using:

myWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_res/raw/myfile.html");


then only emulator android 2.2 API level 8 can load the file probably, other older versions show the same error. Am i missing something?

Is there any way of loading an existing .html file in the application package which works on all API versions ?

A:ok, that was my very stupid mistake. I post the answer here just in case someone has the same problem.

The correct path for files stored in assets folder is file:///android_asset/* (with no "s" for assets folder which i was always thinking it must have a "s").

And, mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/myfile.html"); works under all API levels.

I still not figure out why mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_res/raw/myfile.html"); works only on API level 8. But it doesn't matter now.
