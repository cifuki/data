Q:I am currently developing Android BLE, and encounters a lot of problems with the Android BLE stacks..

My development tool is Samsung Galaxy J with Android 4.3.

I want to know how can I read a characteristics from the BLE and the write the characteristics (is like i verify what data I have received, and then I send another data using the BLE) 

and I have serious problem understanding how the Android BLE callbacks works,
I dont understand these 5 functions...and the manual is not clear, can anyone good soul explain in simple form???

onCharacteristicWrite
onCharacteristicRead
onCharacteristicChanged
onDescriptorRead
onDescriptorWrite


My current situation is, I managed to read the data in onCharacteristicChanged() callback and then I verified the received the data I try to send the data by using 

characteristics.setValue(data)
gatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristics)


But, the Android BLE stack is not calling onCharacteristicsWrite() and in fact, Android just hangs there..

I try to google about Android BLE, there is not much information and only bunch of complains on how unstable the BLE stacks is......

A:Each of the callback from the Android BLE has its functions;

onDescriptorRead and onDescriptorWrite

This is used to write/read the configuration settings for the BLE device, some manufactures might require to send some data to the BLE device and acknowledge it by reading, before you can connect to the BLE device

onCharacteristicWrite

This is used to send data to the BLE device, usually in data mode for the BLE device.
This callback is called when you type

gatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristics);


onCharacteristicRead

This is used to read data from the BLE device
The callback is called when you write this code

gatt.readCharacteristic(characteristics);


onCharacteristicChanged

This callback is called when you are trying to send data using writeCharacteristic(characteristics) and the BLE device responds with some value.

Usually a BLE device has few characteristics, to make it simple, I name a few characteristics


WRITE - write Characteristics
READ - read Characteristics


To make it clear, when you send data, you will need to use WRITE characteristics and then when the BLE device responds Android app will call READ characteristics

A very important point to note is Android BLE stack allows you to write characteristics one at a time only!!

Example: IF you try to call write characteristics twice at a same time

gatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristics);
gatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristics);


The Android BLE stack will not issue the 2nd write characteristics!
