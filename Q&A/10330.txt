Q:I am using a media player.

I have the option for starting ,stopping and pausing the player. The problem I have is that I cannot find the option to resume the song from the point that it previously was paused..

Any help provide would be really helpful.

A:Thank you for your attention but I've got it myself

for pausing the Mediaplayer I used:

Mediaplayer.pause();
length=Mediaplayer.getCurrentPosition();


and for resuming the player from the position where it stopped lately is done by:

Mediaplayer.seekTo(length);
Mediaplayer.start();
