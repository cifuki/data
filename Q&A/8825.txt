Q:Eclipse refuses to build my Android project. In the package explorer, the project root node has the little red error symbol, but nothing else inside of it has this symbol. The Problems tab shows errors detected by Lint:

Call requires API level 3 (current min is 1): android.os.AsyncTask#<init>

Field requires API level 4 (current min is 1): android.os.Build#MANUFACTURER
Field requires API level 4 (current min is 1): android.os.Build$VERSION#SDK_INT


My best guess is that Lint thinks my minSdkVersion is 1, which it isn't; my manifest declares minSdkVersion="8". I've tried the following in an effort to fix this:


Restarting Eclipse
Restarting my computer
Project > Clean
Manually deleting /bin and /gen to force hem to be generated again


At this point I'm out of ideas. Anybody have suggestions?

A:I have the same problem, and my solution is:

Right click on the project folder > Android tools > Clear Lint Markers

"Run Android Lint"  makes some markers and the markers cause this error.
