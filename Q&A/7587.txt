Q:There is only two layout manager for RecyclerView: LinearLayoutManager and GridLayoutManager. Is there a way to use TableLayout as layout manager with RecyclerView? Any suggestion?

EDIT: I wonder if there is any solution without writing a layout manager from zero. TableLayout behaviour is enough for me, just want to add recycle feature for performance issues on handling large amount fo data.

And creating a table looking listview is not solve my problem I think, because my table is very dynamic, I don't know even column names, customer deciding all details of the table. So cells would be custom, column widths needs to be auto resizing depend on content length. I don't think listview can handle that.

Thanks in advance for helps.
