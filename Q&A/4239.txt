Q:There is an event listener in Android called DatePicker.OnDateChangedListener. 
I am trying to set a DatePicker view's on date changed listener as follows:

DatePicker dp = new DatePicker(getContext());
dp.setOnDateChangedListener(this); 
//where this is my activity extends DatePicker.OnDateChangedListener


But guess what? 
Date picker does not have a method called setOnDateChangedListener.

My question is: 


How then do you set a date changed listener in Android?  
If it is not possible to set a date changed listener, what is the purpose for this event?


Any documentation/tutorials will be very helpful.

A:Once you've created your DatePicker, you need to initialize it with the date you want to display at first. That's the point at which you can add your listener.

See DatePicker.init(int, int, int, OnDateChangedListener).
