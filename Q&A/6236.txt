Q:I'm new to Android Studio and while creating a new project it stuck at resolving dependencies :app:_debugCompile. I waited for too long and even tried to create a new project, but that didn't worked. Here's a screenshot of the window:



Here's the contents of build.gradle file:

// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.0.0'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

A:maybe you have problem to connect to the internet to download gradle,
you can set in http proxy

File->Settings->Http Proxy->Manual proxy configuration->HTTP

Host name:172.16.26.2(that's mine)
Port number:8080

of course,you need to change the Host name,the proxy you use
