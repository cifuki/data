I can successfully build the app. When I try to open it in Android Studio, I get a handful of errors, mostly around a gradle sync failure. Here's the 5 errors in the Messages console.

I really don't know what this means and Google hasn't turned up anything of any real help. What do I need to do here?

Note: discovered this after posting this. Relaying it here in case it will help someone else.

Don't upgrade to Android Studio 3

A:I commented the lines below in the build.gradle file:

//debugCompile project(path: 'CordovaLib', configuration: 'debug') 

//releaseCompile project(path: 'CordovaLib', configuration: 'release')


and added:

compile project(':CordovaLib')


This worked for me.
