Q:I have Android Studio 2.2. I am trying to open a project, but I get the error "Failed to find target with hash string 'android-25'". Below the error message I see a link "Install missing platform(s) and synch project". If I click this link, I get another error, which says 


  "The following packages are not available: - Package id
  platforms;android-25".


In the Android SDK tool, I can see "Android 7.0" (API level 24) already installed. On checking the details about Android verisons and its API levels, I found that Android Nougat has API levels 24-25. I would like to know how I can update the SDK from API24 to 25?

A:you don't need to update anything. Just download SDK for API 25 from Android SDK Manager or by launching Android standalone SDK manager. The error is for missing platform and not for missing tool.
