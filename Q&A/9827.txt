Q:Is there any folder like res/drawable for mp3 or generally audio files? If yes, what is it and how can I get access to it from the app?

A:The best place to put such .mp3 or any other files would be in the assets folder.

These files once stored will become a part of your android app itself and can be read easily. This tutorial describes it well.

 AssetFileDescriptor afd = getAssets().openFd("AudioFile.mp3");
 MediaPlayer player = new MediaPlayer();
 player.setDataSource(afd.getFileDescriptor(),afd.getStartOffset(),afd.getLength());
 player.prepare();
 player.start();


Alternatively you can also store it in the raw folder and read it directly by specifying the path as the raw folder.
this can be played as:

int resID=getResources().getIdentifier(fname, "raw", getPackageName());
MediaPlayer mediaPlayer=MediaPlayer.create(this,resID);
