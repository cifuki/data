Q:I'm using an xml defined animation to slide a view off the screen. The problem is, as soon as the animation completes it resets to its original position. I need to know how to fix this. Here's the xml:

<set xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:interpolator="@android:anim/accelerate_interpolator">
   <translate android:fromXDelta="0" android:toXDelta="-100%p" android:duration="500"/></set>


Here's the Java that I use to call it:

    homeScrn = (View)findViewById(R.id.homescreen);
    slideLeftOut = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this, R.anim.slide_left_out);

    //Set Click Listeners For Menu
    btnHelp.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
            LayoutInflater.from(getApplicationContext()).inflate(R.layout.help, (ViewGroup)findViewById(R.id.subpage), true);
            homeScrn.startAnimation(slideLeftOut);
        }
    });


So basically what happens is I inflate a view underneath one. Then I animate the view on top off to the left. As soon as it gets off screen and the animation is finished it resets its position back.

A:The animations are working as expected. Just because you animated something does not mean you actually moved it. An animation only affects drawn pixels during the animation itself, not the configuration of the widgets.

You need to add an AnimationListener, and in the onAnimationEnd() method, do something that makes your move permanent (e.g., removes the view on top from its parent, marks the view on top as having visibility GONE).
