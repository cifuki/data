Q:Trying to call a method in my activity from a fragment. I want the fragment to give the method data and to get the data when the method return. I want to achieve similar to call on a static method, but without the use of static because it create problems in the activity. 

New to fragments so I need an easy and pedagogic explanation!

Thanks!

A:From fragment to activty:

((YourActivityClassName)getActivity()).yourPublicMethod();


From activity to fragment:

FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();

//if you added fragment via layout xml
YourFragmentClass fragment = (YourFragmentClass)fm.findFragmentById(R.id.your_fragment_id);
fragment.yourPublicMethod();


If you added fragment via code and used a tag string when you added your fragment, use findFragmentByTag instead:

YourFragmentClass fragment = (YourFragmentClass)fm.findFragmentByTag("yourTag");
