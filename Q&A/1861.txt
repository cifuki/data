Q:I built a web app and wants to create an android app that has a webview that shows my web app. After following the instructions from Google Developer to create an app, I successfully installed it on my phone with Android 5.1.1.

However, when I run the app for the first time, the webview shows the message:


  Web page not available
  
  The Web page at http://www.google.com.sg could not be loaded as:
  
  net::ERR_CACHE_MISS


After searching for a while on Google and trying out solutions, I am still stuck on this error. I have included all permissions needed so it shouldn't be beacuse of that. My Android Studio is also fully updated so it is not because of that.

A:I solved the problem by changing my AndroidManifest.xml.

old Â : <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.internet"/>
new: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
