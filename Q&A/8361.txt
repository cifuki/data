Do you know any crash reporting library for Android?

I don't want to spend a lot of time to write my own reporting system.
The output can be send to the email or some kind of server.

I know that Google introduced crash reporting in Froyo, but I want something for older versions of the system.



Let's sum up the answers:


android-remote-stacktrace - sends raports to mail or php script
acra - sends reports to google docs
Android Error Reporter - sends reports via HTTP post request

A:This is what you are looking for: android-remote-stacktrace
It sends an email / calls a php script when your application crashes and sends the logcat output. Quite simple to use and very useful!

Remotely log unhandled exceptions in your Android applications
