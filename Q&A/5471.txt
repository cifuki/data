Q:How do i go about getting the details of the certificate an apk was signed with. I have a bunch of apks signed with different certificate and I am trying to group them based on their certificate. 

I can get the certificate expiry details using the jarsigner and complete my task but I was curious if I can get any more details or extract the public key ( I believe it stored in META-INF/cert.RSA but its not readable )

A:Try the following:

openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -in CERT.RSA -noout -print_certs -text
