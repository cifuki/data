Q:Does any one know how to remove a project from Android Studio in an attempt to re- export it from Eclipse? 

So far I have tried removing all the gradle files associated with the project, which causes an error when Android Studio tries to open my project. 

These files were not located in AndriodStudioProjects Folder because I only imported the project it was not moved....

Basically what I would like to accomplish is, removing the file from the list of recent projects in Android Studio, re-export it from Eclipse and then import a working project back into Android Studio.
