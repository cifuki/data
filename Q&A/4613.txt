Q:Which one is better and why?

This one:

@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);

    ...
}


or this:

@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
    // do not call super.onActivityResult()
    ...
}

A:The first one is better.

It's more consistent with other event functions in the Activity API, it costs you nothing (the code you're calling does nothing at the moment), and it means you don't need to remember to add the call in the future when the behaviour of the base class changes.

Edit

As Su-Au Hwang has pointed out, my prediction about the behaviour of the base class changing in the future has come true! FragmentActivity requires you to call the method on super.
