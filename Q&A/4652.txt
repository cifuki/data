Q:After update Android Studio to 2.3 version I have warning:


  Warning:Using incompatible plugins for the annotation processing:
  android-apt. This may result in an unexpected behavior.


Any solutions? My app stopped working...

A:Your app level gradle dependencies should include (as per butterknife website instructions):

compile 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:8.8.1'
annotationProcessor 'com.jakewharton:butterknife-compiler:8.8.1'


You can remove the line : 

apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'


Annotation Processing became available in Android Gradle plugin (2.2 and later) so there is now no need to use the above plugin anymore if using this version of gradle or greater.

If you'd like to know how to turn annotation processing off and on and AS the setting is in : 

Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors
