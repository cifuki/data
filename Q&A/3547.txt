Q:I'm trying to let the user choose any image that they want on their device to use as a wallpaper in this wallpaper application I'm building. For some reason when I write:

Intent myIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK);
myIntent.setType("image/*");
startActivityForResult(myIntent, 100);


I go straight into the gallery, but when I write:

Intent myIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT, null);
myIntent.setType("image/*");
startActivityForResult(myIntent, 100);


I get to choose from Gallery, or Google Drive. What is the best way to let the user choose what app to retrieve the picture from every time? Or why do those two different intent constants make a difference?

A:Your first Intent is invalid. The protocol for ACTION_PICK requires you to supply a Uri indicating the collection you are picking from.

If you want the user to choose something based on MIME type, use ACTION_GET_CONTENT.

If you have some specific collection (identified by a Uri) that you want the user to pick from, use ACTION_PICK.

In case of a tie, go with ACTION_GET_CONTENT. While ACTION_PICK is not formally deprecated, Dianne Hackborn recommends ACTION_GET_CONTENT.
