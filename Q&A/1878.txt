Q:When I run my android app from eclipse, I get this error. 

Unexpected exception 'Cannot run program "/home/antz/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools/adb": error=2 No such file or directory' while attempting to get adb version from /home/antz/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools/adb


COPY PASTE FROM Eclipse Error

[2012-11-26 13:43:08 - adb] Unexpected exception 'Cannot run program "/home/antz/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools/adb": error=2, No such file or directory' while attempting to get adb version from '/home/antz/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools/adb'


However my adb is exactly in the location where it says it's not. 

What is wrong and how do I fix this?

I cd into the directory where adb is (/home/antz/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools/) and I typed in adb and it says

antz@antz-90X3A:~/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools$ ls  
aapt  aidl  dexdump  fastboot  llvm-rs-cc  renderscript  
adb   api   dx       lib       NOTICE.txt  source.properties  
antz@antz-90X3A:~/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools$ adb  
bash: /home/antz/Development/adt-bundle-linux/sdk/platform-tools/adb: No such file or directory


adb is green which means its an executable, correct?

for example, dx is also green and when I typed in dx into the command prompt, it works... whats wrong with adb?

A:On Linux, Android SDK platform-tools package containing adb used to be 32bit. It worked fine on 32bit systems. But on 64bit systems you need to manually install the IA32 library.

For Debian based distributions try this:

sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 lib32ncurses5


But since v24.0 platform-tools contains only 64bit binaries - so 32bit libraries no longer required.
