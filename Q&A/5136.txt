A:WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);
WifiInfo wInfo = wifiManager.getConnectionInfo();
String macAddress = wInfo.getMacAddress(); 


Also, add below permission in your manifest file

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>


Please refer to Android 6.0 Changes. 


  To provide users with greater data protection, starting in this release, Android removes programmatic access to the device\xe2\x80\x99s local hardware identifier for apps using the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth APIs. The WifiInfo.getMacAddress() and the BluetoothAdapter.getAddress() methods now return a constant value of 02:00:00:00:00:00.
  
  To access the hardware identifiers of nearby external devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scans, your app must now have the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION or ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permissions.
