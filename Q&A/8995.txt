Q:I have an array of Strings I'm populating a Spinner object with.  However, I'd like to attach an ID to each element of the Spinner, so when the user selects an item, I have its ID to use to save to some other piece of data.  How can I do this?

A:What do you mean by id. You can use ArrayAdapter to populate the Spinner. When item is selected just get the element from the adapter and save the data you want.

Spinner spinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.spinner);
ArrayAdapter<MyObject> adapter = ... // initialize the adapter
adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.some_view);
spinner.setAdapter(adapter);


and when item is selected 

public void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int pos, long id) {
    MyObject selected = parent.getItemAtPosition(pos);
    // save any data relevant with selected item   
}


If you are storing your data in db you can use CursorAdapter and in onItemSelected to fetch the selected item id from the cursor.
