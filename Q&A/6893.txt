A:DEBUG:


Click on the Gradle tab on the right hand side of the view.
Go to the ROOT folder -> Tasks -> android -> signingReport
Double click, this will build with the signingReport and post in your bottom view your SHA1.


RELEASE:


In android studio. Build -> Generate Signed APK... and click Next
Copy your key store path and key alias.





Traverse to the "bin" folder of the jdk path present in Java.
Open terminal and enter:

keytool -list -v -keystore "key store path" -alias "key alias"
Enter your key password and this will print out your release SHA1.
