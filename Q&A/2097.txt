Q:The fragments I use in my ViewPager instance are quite resource intensive, so I'd only like to load one at a time. When I try the following:

mViewPager.setOffscreenPageLimit(0);
mViewPager.setAdapter(mPagerAdapter);


My FragmentStatePagerAdapter.getItem(int position) override function is called 3 times, which is what happens when I call mViewPager.setOffscreenPageLimit(1). I would expect it to only be called once, because I specified 0 offscreen pages. 

I believe I'm calling everything correctly, because if I call mViewPager.setOffscreenPageLimit(2), FragmentStatePagerAdapter.getItem(int position) is called 5 times as I would expect. 

Does ViewPager require a minimum of 1 offscreen pages, or am I doing something wrong here?

A:Does ViewPager require a minimum of 1 offscreen pages


Yes. If I am reading the source code correctly, you should be getting a warning about this in LogCat, something like:

Requested offscreen page limit 0 too small; defaulting to 1
