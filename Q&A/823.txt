Q:This problem was discovered when I tried to run the Android emulator in Eclipse. Can't figure out what happened. I searched online for the solution, but it seemed to be vague and I don't understand clearly.
 I was following the steps to install the AVD according to the sites and I can't figure out what I missed. Please explain it to me in steps to follow.

A:The "ARM EABI v7a System Image" must be available. Install it via the Android SDK manager:


Another hint (see here) - with


Android SDK Tools rev 17 or higher
Android 4.0.3 (API Level 15)
using SDK rev 3 and System Image rev 2 (or higher)


you are able to turn on GPU emulation to get a faster emulator:


Note : As per you786 comment if you have previously created emulator then you need to recreate it, otherwise this will not work.

Intel provides the "Intel hardware accelerated execution manager", which is a VM based emulator for executing X86 images and which is also served by the Android SDK Manager. See a tutorial for the Intel emulator here: HAXM Speeds Up the Android Emulator. Roman Nurik posts here that the Intel emulator with Android 4.3 is "blazing fast".

In the comments of the post above you can find a reference to Genymotion which claims to be the "fastest Android emulator for app testing and presentation". Genymotion runs on VirtualBox. See also their site on Google+, this post from Cyril Mottier and this guide on reddit.
