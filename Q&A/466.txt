Q:I am trying to follow the Android mapping tutorial and got to this part where I had to get an API key.

I have found my debug.keystore but there does not appear to be a keytool application in the directory:



C:\\Documents and Settings\\tward\\\\.android>ls
adb_usb.ini      avd       debug.keystore  repositories.cfg androidtool.cfg  ddms.cfg  default.keyset


There is also no keytool in this directory:

C:\\Android\\android-sdk-windows\\tools>ls
AdbWinApi.dll     apkbuilder.bat       etc1tool.exe         mksdcard.exe
AdbWinUsbApi.dll  ddms.bat             fastboot.exe         source.properties
Jet               dmtracedump.exe      hierarchyviewer.bat  sqlite3.exe
NOTICE.txt        draw9patch.bat       hprof-conv.exe       traceview.bat
adb.exe           emulator.exe         layoutopt.bat        zipalign.exe
android.bat       emulator_NOTICE.txt  lib


I am using Eclipse as my editor and believe that I have downloaded all the latest SDK.

What am I doing wrong?

A:keytool comes with the Java SDK. You should find it in the directory that contains javac, etc.
