Q:I have already read varying answers to above question, but I have a specific problem.
When I start eclipse it gives an error:


  Error Parsing:
  C:\\android-sdk_r24.2-windows\\android-sdk-windows\\system-images\\android-22\\android-wear\\armeabi-v7a
      cvc-complex-type.2.4.d: Invalid content was found starting with element 'd:skin'. No child element is expected at this point.


This error comes when eclipse automatically loads sdk on startup.

A:I have faced the same parse sdk loading problem during eclipse startup like yours (Shown in image below) 



The solution to above problem is to just delete(uninstall) the package Android Wear ARM EABI v7a system image available under Android 5.1.1 (API 22) if it's installed. (No need to uninstall whole 5.1.1 package). May be there is some eclipse bug with this package.



Finally restart eclipse to see your changes.


  Edit: If the problem still exists, try removing other Android Wear
  package also (i.e Android Wear Intel x86 Atom System Image) as
  suggested by @Abhishek in comments below.
