Q:Someone I'm helping with an application needs to locate her debug.keystore - mine is in my .android folder, but when I navigate there on her computer it is not there.

Does something need to be done in order for it to appear? Where is it / how can it be generated again?

A:According to the documentation, performing a build in Eclipse or using ant debug should automatically generate ~/.android/debug.keystore.

But in case this doesn't work, you can create one manually by running:

keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
