Q:I thought this would be easy but as it turns out unfortunately it's not.

What I have:

I have a folder called "myFolder" on my external storage (not sd card because it's a Nexus 4, but that should not be the problem). The folder contains some *.csv files.

What I want:

I want to write a method which does the following: Show a variety of apps (file browsers) from which I can pick one (see picture). After I click on it, the selected file browser should start and show me the content of "myFolder". No more no less.



My question:

How exactly do I do that? I think I came quite close with the following code, but no matter what I do - and I'm certain that there must be something I didn't get right yet - it always opens only the main folder from the external storage.

public void openFolder()
{
File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(),
    "myFolder");

Log.d("path", file.toString());

Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), "*/*");
startActivity(intent);
}

A:This should work:

Uri selectedUri = Uri.parse(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/myFolder/");
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setDataAndType(selectedUri, "resource/folder");

if (intent.resolveActivityInfo(getPackageManager(), 0) != null)
{
    startActivity(intent);
}
else
{
    // if you reach this place, it means there is no any file 
    // explorer app installed on your device
}


Please, be sure that you have any file explorer app installed on your device.

EDIT: added a shantanu's recommendation from the comment.
