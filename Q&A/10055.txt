Q:I have added an image to my Android project which I want to use in the UI. I have added the file my-image.png to the drawable directory (to all 4 drawable directories created with the project), and added the ImageView to the layout:

<ImageView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:id="@+id/imageView"
    android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"
    android:layout_alignLeft="@+id/textView"
    android:layout_marginBottom="63dp"
    android:src="@drawable/my-image" />


The problem is that I get the following error:


  Rendering Problems
  
  Failed to convert @drawable/my-image into a drawable


This is the capture:



Additionaly, if I try to compile the project, I get the following error:


  Gradle: Execution failed for task ':MyProject:processDebugResources'.


Why do I get these errors and how can I solve it? Am I missing something? I've just started Android development.

A:Gradle: Execution failed for task ':MyProject:processDebugResources'.


because you have naming convention error in Resources

file name: must contain only [a-z0-9_.]


Rename file name to my_image
