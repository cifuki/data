Q:I've compiled Trebuchet launcher from CyanogenMod 9, and trying to install it with adb:

$ adb install out/target/product/generic/system/app/Trebuchet.apk
3986 KB/s (7870141 bytes in 1.928s)
    pkg: /data/local/tmp/Trebuchet.apk
Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE]


I tried on Nexus S with CM9 and Galaxy Nexus with stock JB. Why I'm getting this error?

EDIT: In my case I've tried to reinstall system package with package manager. That's not supported, so I've got this error. Source of the error may differ in your case.

A:it means the application which you want to install is already installed. just remove the old one and try again.
