Q:Now I am totally confused by this error message: Android library projects cannot be launched. 

I carefully checked the build path and library, everything seems "OK", and there is no error on Problems view, however, when I tried to run my application as an Android project, it failed and showed that message.

Any explanation for why it's happening is appreciated!

A:From Android's Developer Documentation on Managing Projects from Eclipse with ADT: 

Setting up a Library Project


  Next, set the project's Properties to indicate that it is a library project:
  
  
  In the Package Explorer, right-click the library project and select Properties.
  In the Properties window, select the "Android" properties group at left and locate the Library properties at right.
  Select the "is Library" checkbox and click Apply.
  Click OK to close the Properties window.
  


So, open your project properties, un-select the "Is Library" checkbox, and click Apply to make your project a normal Android project (not a library project).
