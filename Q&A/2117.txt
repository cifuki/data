Q:In an android application I'm loading data from a Db into a TableView inside a Fragment. But when I reload the Fragment it displays the previous data. Can I repopulate the Fragment with current data instead of previous data?

A:I think you want to refresh the fragment contents upon db update

If so, detach the fragment and reattach it

// Reload current fragment
Fragment frg = null;
frg = getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag("Your_Fragment_TAG");
final FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
ft.detach(frg);
ft.attach(frg);
ft.commit();


Your_Fragment_TAG is the name you gave your fragment when you created it

This code is for support library.

If you're not supporting older devices, just use getFragmentManager instead of getSupportFragmentManager

[EDIT]

This method requires the Fragment to have a tag.
In case you don't have it, then @Hammer's method is what you need.
