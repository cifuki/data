Q:I have been using Android Studio in Spanish, and it bothers me that it highlights as incorrect words which are spelt correctly.

Can I add a Spanish dictionary to Android Studio or to my IntelliJ Idea?

A:You can download the Spanish (or any other language) ASCII dictionary from http://www.winedt.org/dictASCII.html and then add it to Android Studio as sebaszw said:


  
  Go to Settings -> Spelling -> Dictionaries
  Click plus symbol(+)
  Select path to your dictionaries folder (inside you must have plaintext word lists with .dic extension)
  Restart Android Studio
  


It worked for me without restarting Android Studio
