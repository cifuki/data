Q:My app has several flavors for several markets in-app-billing systems.

I have a single library which shares the base code for all of my projects. So I decided to add those payment systems to this library as product flavors. 

The question is can android library have product flavors?

If so, how can I include different flavors in respective flavor of the app?

I searched a lot, and I couldn't find anything about this scenario. The only close thing I found was this in http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide:

dependencies {
    flavor1Compile project(path: ':lib1', configuration: 'flavor1Release')
    flavor2Compile project(path: ':lib1', configuration: 'flavor2Release')
}


I changed configuration to different things but it did not work!

I'm using android studio 0.8.2.

A:Finally I found out how to do this, I will explain it here for others facing same problem:

The key part is to set publishNonDefault to true in library build.gradle, Then you must define dependencies as suggested by user guide.

The whole project would be like this:

Library build.gradle:

apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

android {        
    ....
    publishNonDefault true
    productFlavors {
        market1 {}
        market2 {}
    }
}


project build.gradle:

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    ....
    productFlavors {
        market1 {}
        market2 {}
    }
}

dependencies {
    ....
    market1Compile project(path: ':lib', configuration: 'market1Release')
    market2Compile project(path: ':lib', configuration: 'market2Release')
}


Now you can select the app flavor and Build Variants panel and the library will be selected accordingly and all build and run will be done based on the selected flavor.

If you have multiple app module based on the library Android Studio will complain about Variant selection conflict, It's ok, just ignore it.
