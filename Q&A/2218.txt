Q:I'm using facebook-android-sdk-4.19.0 in Android Studio and I followed the Facebook quick start guide at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started (Click on the Quick Start button to sign in with your own facebook account). In the guide, it's told  to copy&paste the following code in the snippet to track app logs

import com.facebook.FacebookSdk;
import com.facebook.appevents.AppEventsLogger;

public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        FacebookSdk.sdkInitialize(getApplicationContext());
        AppEventsLogger.activateApp(this);
    }
}


However, when I copy pasted the code in android studio, it appears that all of the FacebookSdk.sdkInitialize() methods are deprecated. The documentation here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/android/current/class/FacebookSdk/ tells nothing about what method to use to initialize the sdk instead of sdkInitialize(). What method should I use?

A:From the documentation about upgrading SDK:


  The Facebook SDK is now auto initialized on Application start. If you
  are using the Facebook SDK in the main process and don't need a
  callback on SDK initialization completion you can now remove calls to
  FacebookSDK.sdkInitialize. If you do need a callback, you should
  manually invoke the callback in your code.


Refer to: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/upgrading-4x

UPDATE

In SDK 4.22 the title, description, caption and image field of FBSDKShareLinkContent are deprecated. Consider removing them from usage.
