Q:From today, when I tried to run an app in NetBeans on a 2.3.3 Android platform, it shows me that:


  Failed to allocate memory: 8
  
  This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
  Please contact the application's support team for more information.


and the Emulator doesn't want to start.

This is for the first time when I see it, and google has no asnwers for this, I tried even with 2 versions of NetBeans 6.9.1 and 7.0.1, still the same error.

A:I figured it out. The problem was in the amount of ram I had specified for the virtual machine, and it was 1024MB, now I have 512MB and it is ok, now I need to find how to improve this amount of ram, 512 is not so much, and the machine is a little bit laggy.
