Q:I'm getting a completely useless page when I use the Single Sign on for Facebook's Android SDK. 


  "You have already authorized happyapp.
  Press "Okay" to continue.


This page would destroy user experience. How the heck do I get rid of it. Lots of people  have been seeing this, but no solution is posted.

Even Facebook admits this is a problem, see: http://forum.developers.facebook.net/viewtopic.php?id=84548

Does anyone know any work-around?

A:The way I did it (without additional OAuth solution) was to store off the access token in preferences as Kieveli suggested. When the main activity starts, look up the token from preferences, if it's not there initiate the authorization process and store the resulting token in preferences.

The harder part is to handle token expiration or de-authorization of your app (ie. the token is in preferences, but is no longer valid).

For that case, with every FB API/graph invocation, check for an exception indicating authentication failed. If it fails, initiate the authorization/token storing procedure again.
