Q:I'm in the mid of my studies in the Android world, and I just covered the Assets and Raw resources. I'm trying to understand the reason for using Raw resources vs. Assets.


They both provide with an uncompiled resource input stream.
It seems that Assets provide much more flexibility and functionality then Raw resources.

a. You can create folder structure under Assets and not under Raw

b. You can list all resources dynamically in the assets folder and not in the Raw folder.


So, why would I use Raw resources in Android?

A:The main differences between the raw folder and the Assets folder. 


Since raw is a subfolder of Resources (res), Android will
automatically generate an ID for any file located inside it. This
ID is then stored an the R class that will act as a reference to
a file, meaning it can be easily accessed from other Android classes
and methods and even in Android XML files. Using the automatically
generated ID is the fastest way to have access to a file in Android.
The Assets folder is an \xe2\x80\x9cappendix\xe2\x80\x9d directory. The R class does
not generate IDs for the files placed there, so its less compatible
with some Android classes and methods. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s much slower to
access a file inside it, since you will need to get a handle to it
based on a String. However some operations are more easily done by
placing files in this folder, like copying a database file to the
system\xe2\x80\x99s memory. There\xe2\x80\x99s no (easy) way to create an Android XML
reference to files inside the Assets folder.
