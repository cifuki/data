Q:Is there a way to set the selected index of a RadioGroup in android, other than looping through the child radiobuttons and selecting checking the radio button at the selected index?

Note: I am populating the Radio Button Group at run time.

A:If your radio group is defined in a layout xml file, each button can be assigned an id.  Then you just check a button like this

radioGroup.check(R.id.myButtonId);


If you created your radio group programmatically (I'm not even sure how you do this...), you might want to consider creating a special layout xml file just for the radio group so that you can assign R.id.* ids to the buttons.

Please see the answer below if you are, in fact, looking to set the radio button group by index, see the answer below.
