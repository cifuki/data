I have a custom view and would like to access a String that is available in its activity. I've seen code that uses getContext() in the view class, but there is no method to access the String that has been made available to its activity via an intent. How to make a String in an activity available to its custom view?

A:The getContext() method in the View class returns the context that was passed on its constructor. Usually that's the Activity you want (Activity extends Context).
So this probably works for you:

((Activity)getContext()).someMethod(...);
