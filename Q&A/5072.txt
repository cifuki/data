Q:Please, what is the device with the minimum screen resolution on the market?
    
===============================================================================================
67
A:According to the latest Compatibility Definition Document, the definition for screen configurations require that:


Screens MUST be at least 2.5 inches in physical diagonal size 
Density MUST be at least 100 dpi 
The aspect ratio MUST be between 1.333 (4:3) and 1.779 (16:9) 
The display technology used consists of square pixels


In practical terms, the lowest screen resolution currently being used is QVGA (240x320). There are a couple of phones that use this resolution including the HTC Tattoo and Wildfire. The smallest device I'm aware of is the 2.55" QVGA Sony Ericsson X10 Mini.
