Q:Newbie Question from an iPhone developer.

I have called the startActivity(intent) and the new activity loads. How do I go 'back' to the calling activity once a button is pushed. 'Popping' the activity off the stack basically.

A:If you had created the new Activity with startActivity you just need to call finish.  If you had spawned the new Activity by calling startActivityForResults then you need to call setResult and then finish in order to pass back data to the onActivityResult method of the prior Activity.
