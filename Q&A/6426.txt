Q:I am trying to find out the data usage on Android on a per-application basis. Something like Android Data Usage Apps and Quota / Cap Monitor Widgets: never get charged extra for data or get capped again!.

I looked at Stack Overflow question How to go about detecting data usage in the Android environment.

But it's not been of much help.



ActivityManager activityManager = (ActivityManager) this.getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
ActivityManager.MemoryInfo mInfo = new ActivityManager.MemoryInfo();
activityManager.getMemoryInfo( mInfo );
List<RunningAppProcessInfo> listOfRunningProcess = activityManager.getRunningAppProcesses();
Log.d(TAG, "XXSize: " + listOfRunningProcess.size());

for (RunningAppProcessInfo runningAppProcessInfo : listOfRunningProcess) {

    if (runningAppProcessInfo.uid > 1026)
    {
        Log.d(TAG, "ANS " + runningAppProcessInfo.processName +
                   " Id :" + runningAppProcessInfo.pid +
                   " UID: " + runningAppProcessInfo.uid);
    }
}


I tried the above code as suggested by Akos Cz. However all the UIDs are numbers, unlike app_79 as you have mentioned above. Is this all right?

A:The following links should help you figure out how to programmatically determine the data usage per application.


cw-andtuning/TrafficMonitor (GitHub)
Create a network monitor using Android's TrafficStats class
Android Traffic Statistics Inside


You will need to implement your code to use the TraficStats API and track the number of bytes sent/received per UID (application).
