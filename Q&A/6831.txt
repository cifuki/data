Q:i'm looking very hard for a possibility to encrypt my sqlite database on Android devices, but I was't able to find a satisfying solution.

I need something like a libary to reference, in order to have a "on the fly" encryption/decryption of my database, while using the normal sqlite functions.

I don't want to encrypt data before storing.

I don't want to encrypt the whole databasefile, in order to decrypt it before using.

I know about the following projects:


SEE
wxSQLite
SQLCipher
SQLiteCrypt
Botan


But I can't find any working example for this stuff.

Btw, I'm absolutly willing to purchase a commercial build, but I have to test ist before spending a few hundred dollars.

Did anyone solve this issue for his own? 

edit:
question is solved by commonsWare, if you follow his Link:
SQLCypher port to Android
You will be able to download the neccesary Files and have to add them to your Project. This might look like this:

A:Try the SQLCipher port to Android instead of the regular SQLCipher.
