A:You can access this folder using the DDMS for your Emulator. you can't access this location on a real device unless you have a rooted device.

You can view Table structure and Data in Eclipse. Here are the steps


Install SqliteManagerPlugin for Eclipse. Jump to step 5 if you already have it.
Download the *.jar file from here
Put the *.jar file into the folder eclipse/dropins/
Restart eclipse
In the top right of eclipse, click the DDMS icon
Select the proper emulator in the left panel
In the File Explorer tab on the main panel, go to /data/data/[YOUR.APP.NAMESPACE]/databases
Underneath the DDMS icon, there should be a new blue icon of a Database light up when you select your database. Click it and you will see a Questoid Sqlite Manager tab open up to view your data.


*Note: If the database doesn't light up, it may be because your database doesn't have a *.db file extension. Be sure your database is called [DATABASE_NAME].db

*Note: if you want to use a DB without .db-Extension:


Download this Questoid SqLiteBrowser: http://www.java2s.com/Code/JarDownload/com.questoid/com.questoid.sqlitebrowser_1.2.0.jar.zip
Unzip and put it into eclipse/dropins (not Plugins)
