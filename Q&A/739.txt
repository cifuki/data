Q:What's the best way to create a temporary file in Android? 

Can File.createTempFile be used? The documentation is very vague about it.

In particular, it's not clear when temporary files created with File.createTempFile are deleted, if ever.

A:This is what I typically do:

File outputDir = context.getCacheDir(); // context being the Activity pointer
File outputFile = File.createTempFile("prefix", "extension", outputDir);


As for their deletion, I am not complete sure either. Since I use this in my implementation of a cache, I manually delete the oldest files till the cache directory size comes down to my preset value.
