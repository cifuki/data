Q:In my Android app, I always get VerifyErrors! And I cannot figure out why. Whenever I include a external JAR, I always get VerifyErrors when I try to launch my app (except for once, when I included Apache Log4j.) 

I usually get around this by taking the source of the library and adding it to my project, but I am trying to put the GData client library.

I can get this in source, but it's dependencies (mail.jar, activation.jar, servlet-api.jar) I cannot, so I get verify errors. I would like to get to the root of this problem once and for all. I looked on the internet, but they all seem to talk about incomplete class files? which I do not know of.

A:Android uses a different class file format.  Are you running the 3rd party JAR files through the "dx" tool that ships with the Android SDK?
