Q:Trying to copy file from device to desktop, here is a command:

adb pull sdcard/log.txt Users/admin/Desktop


But this command creates a folder Users/admin/Desktop inside platform-tools folder where adb is located. How to pull file to my desktop ?

A:Use a fully-qualified path to the desktop (e.g., /home/mmurphy/Desktop).
