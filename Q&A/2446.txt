Q:I have updated my Android Studio to the newest version, but now when I call the auto-completion/suggestions with CTRL+SPACE the suggestion box opens but the documentation window opens as well.

Has anyone experienced this and know how to disable the opening of the documentation window?

A:Ctrl-Q toggles between doc window states (when using the default keymap).

Possible states are:

-Hidden
-Shown to the side of the auto-complete list
-Docked as one of the tabs


If you have a different keymap, you can search for this action in Settings -> Keymap. The action is called "Quick Doc".
