Q:Hi I want to have a progress bar for image which will shown while image loading but when image loading will be completed I want to set it to gone. Earlier I was using Picasso library for this. But I don't know how to use it with Glide library. I have idea that some resource ready function is there but I don't know how to use it. Can anyone help me? 

Code for Picasso Library

Picasso.with(mcontext).load(imgLinkArray.get(position).mUrlLink)
       .into(imageView, new Callback() {
           @Override
           public void onSuccess() {
               progressBar.setVisibility(View.GONE);
           }

           @Override
           public void onError() {
           }
        })
;


Now How Can I do this with Glide?

Glide.with(mcontext).load(imgLinkArray.get(position).mUrlLink)
     .into(imageView);


I am able to load image by this with Glide but how can I write progressBar.setVisibility(View.GONE); somewhere in code if image get loaded?

A:Question is rather old, and I don't know what was the situation with glide in those times, but now it can be easily done with listener (not as proposed in the answer chosen as correct).

progressBar.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
Glide.with(getActivity())
     .load(args.getString(IMAGE_TO_SHOW))
     .listener(new RequestListener<String, GlideDrawable>() {
         @Override
         public boolean onException(Exception e, String model, Target<GlideDrawable> target, boolean isFirstResource) {
             return false;
         }

         @Override
         public boolean onResourceReady(GlideDrawable resource, String model, Target<GlideDrawable> target, boolean isFromMemoryCache, boolean isFirstResource) {
             progressBar.setVisibility(View.GONE);
             return false;
         }
     })
     .into(imageFrame)
;


You return true if want to handle things like animations yourself and false if want glide to handle them for you.
