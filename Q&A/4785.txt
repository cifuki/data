Q:API Level < 21 

Thumb is transparent, as expected.



On API Level 21

Thumb is opaque, Wonder why.



Here is the code

 <SeekBar
                android:id="@+id/ui_audioplayer_progressbar"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:progressDrawable="@drawable/custom_progress_bar_horizontal"
                android:thumb="@drawable/stud_slider" />


Interestingly, this problem can be seen and reproduced in the xml preview in eclipse itself, when you change the API Level perspectives. 





Note: 


I run the same apk on both devices.
Both devices are of the same make and model, i.e Nexus 5.
The thumb image is a PNG with a transparent background, as apparent from the screenshot for API Level < 21


Is this a known bug in Lollipop or am i doing something wrong?
