Q:I have an activity with an Edit Text input.  When the activity is initialized, the Android keyboard is shown.  How can the keyboard remain hidden until the user focuses the input?

A:I think the following may work

getWindow().setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN);


I've used it for this sort of thing before.
