Q:What font file types does Android support (for use with Typeface.createFromAsset, for instance)? 

I can't seem to find a list in the documentation. I can see TTF gets mentioned in some tutorials and someone on here hinted that OTF is also supported now but is there a comprehensive list that shows what font file types are supported by the different API levels?

Many thanks.

EDIT: to be specific: can someone show me where it mentions font compatibility and supported font types in the docs - if there is anything there?

A:Android docs doesn't specify the fonts that it supports.When Android dislikes a custom font, rather than raising an Exception, it seems to substitute Droid Sans ("sans").
