Q:OK, this is a strange one that I didn't think was even possible.

So, ever since I've been using a Nexus 5X, the SharedPreferences are not getting wiped when I uninstall my app.

I install the app through Android Studio and test things. I then uninstall the app. I then resintall the app through Android Studio and all the SharedPreferences values are still there.

I've tried clearing the data/cache in addition to uninstalling. The SharedPreferences are persistent through all those attempts.

I am using stock Android 6.0 on a Nexus 5X. My device is not rooted. I am not using a custom ROM. I do not have this issue with my Nexus 4. 

Any ideas what might be causing this?

A:the <application> object in your app manifest needs to say: android:allowBackup="false". This is a new marshmallow feature.
