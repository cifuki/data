Q:When I tried to reset my adb the following error occurs:

[2011-09-14 09:34:06 - DeviceMonitor]Adb connection Error:An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
[2011-09-14 09:34:07 - DeviceMonitor]Connection attempts: 1


I am just making a simple "hello world" program.

A:Well, its not compulsory to restart the emulator you can also reset adb from eclipse itself.

1.)
Go to DDMS and there is a reset adb option, please see the image below.


2.) You can restart adb manually from command prompt 

  run->cmd->your_android_sdk_path->platform-tools>


Then write the below commands.

adb kill-server - To kill the server forcefully

adb start-server - To start the server

UPDATED:

F:\\android-sdk-windows latest\\platform-tools>adb kill-server

F:\\android-sdk-windows latest\\platform-tools>adb start-server
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
