Q:How do you setup a project that can result in a jar library file that can be used for android?
I want to create a custom library across all projects.

Few other questions:


Does it need to be compiled against a specific version of android sdk?
When an android package is compiled against a jar library does the classes necessary to work with the code get compiled with main code into the apk or does the entire jar get included?
Any notable optimizations or pitfalls I need to know about with using a jar instead of integrating the code directly?
Does the jar have to be signed like the apk needs to?

A:Google just release a new version of the SDK that handles Shared Libraries!

ADT 0.9.7 (May 2010)


  Library projects: The ADT Plugin now
  supports the use of library projects
  during development, a capability that
  lets you store shared Android
  application code and resources in a
  separate development project. You can
  then reference the library project
  from other Android projects and, at
  build time, the tools compile the
  shared code and resources as part of
  the dependent applications. More
  information about this feature is
  available in the Developing in Eclipse
  with ADT document. If you are not
  developing in Eclipse, SDK Tools r6
  provides the equivalent library
  project support through the Ant build
  system.
