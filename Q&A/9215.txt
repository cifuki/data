Q:I did one sample application using WebView, in that web view the URL comes from web services. It's working fine, but if I click any link within that WebView, its automatically go for default web browser. But I want to open within my application web view only. Here my code:

WvBikeSite = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.wv_bikeWebsite);
wvBikeSite.loadUrl(getBundle.getString("www"));

A:You have to set up a webViewClient for your webView.

Sample:

this.mWebView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient(){

    @Override
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
      view.loadUrl(url);
      return true;
    }
});
