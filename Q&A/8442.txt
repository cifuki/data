Q:I have no WIFI, I have no cable connection available.

Is there hope for me to connect my device to ADB?

A:With the latest releases of Cyanogenmod (7.2 and 9) and presumably some other roms the option of adb over network has arrived.

Similar to ADB over WIFI which has been available for a while, it pretty much does the same.


Enable Bluetooth on your laptop and device
Pair them
Connect from your laptop to your device via Bluetooth PAN (Personal Area Network)
Enable the ADB over Network setting (Settings/Applications/Development)
Find out your IP address from the terminal (busybox ifconfig should do)


Non-root: check the default gateway on your computer, it should be your device's IP

Connect your device from your computer via adb connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Enjoy.


Make sure to disable the ADB over Network setting after your done with it to avoid Mobile Internet ADB stuff. Just disable the Bluetooth when your done and it should be fine.

Bonus part is, that while your paired and developing for this, you are able to use the devices mobile internet as well. (if you have coverage, of course)

This is only a partial solution since it needs the device to be both rooted and running a rom that offers that particular setting. I can only assume that it can be done some other way from the terminal, but I'm not savvy enough to manage it.
