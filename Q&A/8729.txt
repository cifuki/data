Q:Since a new API of Android 6.0 is available in SDK Manager a hint was appeared in application level build.gradle file to update 

FROM

androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:22.0.1'
compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.0.1'


TO

androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:23.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0'


I haven't downloaded new update from sdk manager for Android 6(API 23) yet but still changed the following details as shown below,

BEFORE

compileSdkVersion 22
buildToolsVersion "22.0.1"
targetSdkVersion 22
androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:22.0.1'
compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.0.1'


AFTER

    compileSdkVersion 23
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.0"
    targetSdkVersion 23
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:23.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0'


As I haven't downloaded new API 6.0 yet, following error occurred

Error:Cause: failed to find target with hash string 'android-23' in: C:\\Users\\DRONE\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk


So now again I changed the setting in application level build.gradle file as what it was before, but the error is not being resolved.
Same error is occurring.

How do I solve this now?

A:Normally it is caused by not having API 23.
After updating the SDK to the newer version, it often rewrites build.gradle to the highest API version SDK provided even if you didn't upload it.
The easiest way - download API 23.
