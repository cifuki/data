Q:So I'm not sure where/how to implement this method to make my service run in the foreground. Currently I start my service by the following in another activity: 

Intent i = new Intent(context, myService.class); 
context.startService(i);


And then in myServices' onCreate() I try the startForeground()...? 

Notification notification = new Notification();
startForeground(1, notification);


So yeah I'm a bit lost and unsure of how to implement this.

A:I'd start by completely filling in the Notification. Here is a sample project demonstrating the use of startForeground().
