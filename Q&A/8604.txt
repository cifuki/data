Q:How can I know the visible size of my activity?  

I'm trying to get the Activity real size,
not the height and width from getHeight() and getWidth(),
which gives me the screen full size.

A:I think you'll want to look at Activity.getWindow() and Window.getDecorView(), and get the width/height of that.
