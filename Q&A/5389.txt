A:It is easy to do that..


First you get all installed applications,
For each one, get public source directory.
copy the file to the SDCard.


Note: No need to be rooted.

Here is the snippt code:    

final Intent mainIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN, null);
mainIntent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER);
List<ResolveInfo> apps = getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities(mainIntent, 0);
for (ResolveInfo info : apps) {
    File file = new File(info.activityInfo.applicationInfo.publicSourceDir);
    // Copy the .apk file to wherever
}
