Q:I have the following scenario in my application.  There is no UI in my application; instead there is a Service which starts on boot up and will continuously run.

How can I configure my manifest file without a main Activity? Can I launch my app without any Activity? And on launching my app, my Service should start. Is this possible?

I don't want to make a translucent Activity to start the Service.

A:You said you didn't want to use a translucent Activity, but that seems to be the best way to do this:


In your Manifest, set the Activity theme to Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.
Don't bother with a layout for your Activity, and don't call setContentView().
In your Activity's onCreate(), start your Service with startService().
Exit the Activity with finish() once you've started the Service.


In other words, your Activity doesn't have to be visible; it can simply make sure your Service is running and then exit, which sounds like what you want.

I would highly recommend showing at least a Toast notification indicating to the user that you are launching the Service, or that it is already running.  It is very bad user experience to have a launcher icon that appears to do nothing when you press it.
