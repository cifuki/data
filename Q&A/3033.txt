Q:I want to setup a part of my application that allows users to send a quick email to another user.  It's not very hard to set this up:

Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
intent.setType("text/plain");
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject);
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, message);
Intent mailer = Intent.createChooser(intent, null);
startActivity(mailer);


However, the problem is that the ACTION_SEND is accepted by more than just email programs - for example, on my phone the Facebook app, Twitter, reddit is fun, and even Bluetooth come up as viable alternatives for sending this message.  The message is entirely too long for some of these (especially Twitter).

Is there a way to limit the chooser to just applications that support long messages (such as email)?  Or is there a way to detect the app that the user has chosen and adjust the message appropriately?

A:Changing the MIME type is the answer,  this is what I did in my app to change the same behavior. I used intent.setType("message/rfc822");
