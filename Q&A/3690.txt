Q:I'm trying to save data in a Fragment's onSaveInstanceState(), but the method is never called.

Can someone help?

public class MyFragment extends Fragment {

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ScrollView content = (ScrollView) inflater.inflate(R.layout.content, container, false);
        // More stuff
        return content;
    }

    @Override
    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle icicle) {
        // NEVER CALLED
        super.onSaveInstanceState(icicle);
        //More stuff
    }

}

A:I finally figured out the problem, at least in my case.  I had an overridden onSaveInstanceState in my FragmentActivity that did not call super.onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState).  Once I added that in, the Fragment.onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) functioned normally.
