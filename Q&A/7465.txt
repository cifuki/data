Q:I am trying to place html into a TextView. Everything works perfectly, this is my code.

String htmlTxt = "<p>Hellllo</p>"; // the html is form an API
Spanned html = Html.fromHtml(htmlTxt);
myTextView.setText(html);


This sets my TextView with the correct html. But my problem is, having a  tag in the html, the result text that goes into the TextView has a "\
" at the end, so it pushes my TextView's height higher than it should be.

Since its a Spanned variable, I can't apply regex replace to remove the "\
", and if I was to convert it into a string, then apply regex, I lose the functionality of having html anchors to work properly.

Does anyone know any solutions to remove the ending linebreak(s) from a "Spanned" variable?

A:Nice answer @Christine. I wrote a similar function to remove trailing whitespace from a CharSequence this afternoon:

/** Trims trailing whitespace. Removes any of these characters:
 * 0009, HORIZONTAL TABULATION
 * 000A, LINE FEED
 * 000B, VERTICAL TABULATION
 * 000C, FORM FEED
 * 000D, CARRIAGE RETURN
 * 001C, FILE SEPARATOR
 * 001D, GROUP SEPARATOR
 * 001E, RECORD SEPARATOR
 * 001F, UNIT SEPARATOR
 * @return "" if source is null, otherwise string with all trailing whitespace removed
 */
public static CharSequence trimTrailingWhitespace(CharSequence source) {

    if(source == null)
        return "";

    int i = source.length();

    // loop back to the first non-whitespace character
    while(--i >= 0 && Character.isWhitespace(source.charAt(i))) {
    }

    return source.subSequence(0, i+1);
}
