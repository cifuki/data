Q:In the new lollipop update I noticed that with the native Google apps the color of the status bar changes to match the action bar on the app you're running. I see it's on the Twitter app also so I'm guessing it's not exclusively Google who can do it. 

Does anyone know how to do this if it is possible?

A:To change status bar color use setStatusBarColor(int color).
According the javadoc, we also need set some flags on the window. 

Working snippet of code:

Window window = activity.getWindow();
window.addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DRAWS_SYSTEM_BAR_BACKGROUNDS);
window.clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS);
window.setStatusBarColor(ContextCompat.getColor(activity, R.color.example_color));



Keep in mind according Material Design guidelines status bar color and action bar color should be different:


ActionBar should use primary 500 color
StatusBar should use primary 700 color


Look at the screenshot below:
