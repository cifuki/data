Q:I am new to android, I have a code in which I have placed buttons in list view.
My list is as..

Number | Name | ID (visibility = gone) | Level | button1 | button2


Function is different in button 1 and button 2 case. I have applied listeners on buttons but when I try to get the ID from list it always shows me the last id. 

How to know which button was clicked, name and id of related field.

I have placed buttons and listener on buttons in getView(...) function.

A:final ListView lv = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.ListView01);

lv.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
      public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> myAdapter, View myView, int myItemInt, long mylng) {
        String selectedFromList =(String) (lv.getItemAtPosition(myItemInt));

      }                 
});


I hope this fixes your problem.
