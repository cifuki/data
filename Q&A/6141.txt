A:By Romain Guy From the Question Asked Here,


  Whatever the maximum length of a Java string is. So something like 
  Integer.MAX_VALUE chars.


I suppose while SharedPreference is an XML file stored with One Tag if you store only One Pair/Object.
So there is no limit to write String in that if you think like you are writing in a file..(Theoretically)

But Actually what happens is that, while you are assigning value to SharedPreference using put/get function at that time you Reading/Writting value in String Object..so the limit becomes to store value at one time equal to Size limit of String Object of Java.

So while writting the code: Limit of SharedPreference String Size = Java String Object Size Limit(Practically)
