Q:Split lib_main was defined multiple times

In "com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-alpha3" build success,
But the errors that occur in the "com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-alpha5".





finally instant run work!! com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-alpha8 and gradle.properties "org.gradle.jvmargs = -Xmx8g" was resolved to change.

A:For those who wonder what InstantRun is (first setting in the picture):


And yes disabling that setting fixes the issue.

'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-alpha6' was released three days ago. Using that new version, the "Split lib_main was defined multiple times" error is gone and installation of the app succeeds but now I get a runtime error:

java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to instantiate application

Turning off instant run eliminates that error.
Let's wait for com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-alpha7...

'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-alpha7' was released two days ago.

Getting the same exception as with 2.0.0-alpha6
