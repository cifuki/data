Q:I have a layout which has three fields for the entry of three map coordinates.  So far so good.  I'm using android:inputType="numberDecimal" in the layout.  When entering the field the user gets the numeric keypad.  Still good.  

However, when a negative coordinate needs to be entered, there is no apparent way to do this.

23.2342 works fine.
232.3421 works fine.
-11.23423 can not be entered - there is no way to enter the leading negative sign, or even wrap the coordinate in ().

I'm sure I can go the route of changing this to straight text inputType, and then use a regular expression to validate that what was entered is in fact a numeric coordinate, handle error messaging back to the user, etc.  But I'd rather not go that route.  

I have Googled and Stackoverflowed this question for a couple hours with no luck.  Any suggestions?

A:Unless I'm missing something this is all you need

android:inputType="numberDecimal|numberSigned"
