Q:I have an activity with a Dialog theme and I would like to close (finish) this activity when someone touches the screen anywhere outside this activity's window ? How can I do this ?

A:If there's no API support, you should just use a FrameLayout to fill the screen, and manually build a pop-up.  Then you can receive focus anywhere on the screen and show/hide views accordingly.
