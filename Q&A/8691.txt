Q:1) Exclusive time is the time spent in the method
2) Inclusive time is the time spent in the method plus the time spent in any called functions
3) We refer to calling methods as "parents" and called methods as "children."

Question here is :

what are difference between


Incl CPU Time &  Incl Real CPU Time ?
Excl CPU Time &  Excl Real CPU Time ?


in my one example trace file
for Method1() :  Incl CPU Time = 242 msec  & Incl Real CPU Time = 5012 msec


i can not identify reason behind 5012-242 = 4770 msec gap in above both times.


Please help me if you have any idea.
