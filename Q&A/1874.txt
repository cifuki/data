I often need the different parts of my applications to have their own special behavior and UI, and I don't know how fragments can help. In most cases, I think it is quicker to create 2 different activities (e.g., 1 for tablets and 1 for handsets), and to share the common behaviors and events in a third class.

So, keeping this in mind, why should I use fragments ?

A:Fragments are more of a UI benefit in my opinion.  It's convenient for the user sometimes to see two different views of two different classes on the same screen.  If, in your moment of creativity, you decide it would be nice to display your application with, say, a listView that takes up half the screen and a webView that takes up the other half - so that when you click on a list item in fragment A it passes an intent to the webView in fragment B, and suddenly you see what you just clicked without the app switching activities - then you could use a fragment.  That's just an example I came up with off the top of my head.  

Bottom line: Fragments are two or more activities on the screen at the same time.
