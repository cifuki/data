Q:How do you implement the bottom sheet specficiation? 
http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html

The new update to Google Drive shows this with the Floating Action Button press ->



Granted the specs never say anything about rounded corners, regardless it is possible to do, just unsure of how to go about it. Currently using the AppCompat library and target set to 21.

Thanks

A:Edit

The BottomSheet is now part of the android-support-library. See John Shelleys' answer.



Unfortunately there's currently no "official" way on how to do this (at least none that I'm aware of).
Luckily there's a library called "BottomSheet" (click) which mimics the look and feel of the BottomSheet and supports Android 2.1 and up.

In case of the Drive app, here's how the code would look like with this library:

    new BottomSheet.Builder(this, R.style.BottomSheet_Dialog)
            .title("New")
            .grid() // <-- important part
            .sheet(R.menu.menu_bottom_sheet)
            .listener(new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
            // TODO
        }
    }).show();


menu_bottom_sheet (basically a standard /res/menu/*.xml resource)

<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item
        android:id="@+id/folder"
        android:title="Folder"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_action_folder" />
    <item
        android:id="@+id/upload"
        android:title="Upload"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_action_file_upload" />
    <item
        android:id="@+id/scan"
        android:title="Scan"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_action_camera_alt" />
</menu>




Output looks like this:



Which, I think, comes pretty close to the original. If you're not happy with the colors you can customize it - see this (click).
