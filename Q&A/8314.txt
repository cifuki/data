Q:when I tried to install the ADT to eclipse (indigo) the following error came up:

Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
Software currently installed: Shared profile 1.0.0.1316138547364 (SharedProfile_epp.package.java 1.0.0.1316138547364)
Missing requirement: Shared profile 1.0.0.1316138547364 (SharedProfile_epp.package.java 1.0.0.1316138547364) requires 'org.maven.ide.eclipse [1.0.100.20110804-1717]' but it could not be found


What does this mean? How can I fix this?

I have the 64 bit versions of eclipse and jdk, and I tried to install the ADT through the Eclipse Marketplace, same error came up... and I tried to install the eclipse classic... an error came up that said it couldn't find the shared libraries...

A:It seems that you have to run Eclipse as administrator.
