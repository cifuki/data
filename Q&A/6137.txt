How to install Google Play Services on 6.0 Genymotion device?

For other versions this answer works, but not for 6.0

EDIT:

I've tried to use 6.0 Gapps from this source, but all of them failed to flash the emulator.

A:Ivan,
I found the solution here and followed the steps from the user @sinistance and it worked for me using the Nexus 5X Preview API 23.

To simplify this is the answer:


  
    what image did you use? i'm using the preview nexus 5x image. here is the steps:
    
    
    flash Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip then restart.
    flash gapps-L-4-21-15.zip.
    sign in into your google account.
    flash benzo-gapps-M-20151011-signed-chroma-r3.zip then restart.
    
    
    that's all
  


You can find all the files in the link above!
I hope it works for you!
