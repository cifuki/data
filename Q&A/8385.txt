Q:Is there any way to redraw all items of RecyclerView?

I have some Themes (in style.xml) and after changing the theme, I need the RecyclerView to be redrawn.

So I want a method that will force to re-call onCreateViewHolder for each items of the adapter.

I tried to:


call adapter.notifyDataSetChanged but onCreateViewHolder is not called
call recyclerView.setVisibility(View.GONE) and then recyclerView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE)
call recyclerView.invalidate()
call recyclerView.setAdapter(null) and then recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter).
This works well for 90% items. Only 90% of items will get the new style, but some items will have the old style


I mention that the RecyclerView is attached to an Activity, not to a Fragment.

A:I found the answer!
The correct way to do this is:

recyclerView.setAdapter(null);
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(null);
recyclerView.setAdapter(myAdapter);
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(myLayoutManager);
myAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();


After that, all the items are getting the new style!
