Q:I recently updated my Nexus 9 Tablet to Android 7 Nougat.
Since then the Logcat view in Eclipse stoped displaying Logcat messages, the view just stays empty.
Also the devices target is shown as "Unknown".
If I instead start Logcat outside Eclipse (AndroidSDK->tools->ddms) it displays all messages. However, then the "Application" Column stays empty.
There are allready some (older) questions on this topic here on SO, but none of the solutions here worked for me.
What i tryed:  


Use another USB Port
Focus the device in the DDMS perspective
Restart Eclipse
Reboot the device + pc
abd kill-server
disable and re-enabled USB Debuging on the device
Reset the USB-Debuging authorization and confirm the RSA fingerprint again
Switch USB-Mode to "MTP"  


Every installed package from the Android SDK is up to date and i use latest Eclipse+ADT Plugin.
Also everything works fine with my Galaxy S5 Mini (Android 5.1.1).
I know, that the ADT-Plugin is deprecated and we should use Android Studio.
However I still preffer to use Eclipse as long as possible, so I am looking for a solution for this problem.
So does anyone know how to solve this issue?
