Q:I'm using Android Studio for my Android application.
My code works and compiles.
Recently, the IDE showes me error (red lines) on getClass of the following code:

fragment.getClass().getSimpleName()


But still the application compiles and runs.
The error is:

Ambiguous method call. Both
getClass () in Object\xc2\xa0and
getClass () in Object\xc2\xa0match.


Can some one explain me what is it about? and why the code still running?

A:I think it is a bug in Android Studio. As we know, Android Studio is based on the IntelliJ Platform and the existing functionality of IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

Google has developed it in cooperation with JetBrains. And same bug is reported to happen in IntelliJ as well.
Have a look at the Error report

The only workaround to this issue is to cast the instance you call getClass() on, to Object as follows:

((Object) this).getClass()
