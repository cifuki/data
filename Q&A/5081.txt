Q:I try to import an eclipse project into Android studio.
In the migration instructions it says "In the following dialog, leave Use gradle wrapper selected and click OK. (You do not need to specify the Gradle home.)"

The problem is that the ""Use gradle wrapper" is unselected and grayed out. 

Any suggestions?

A:1) Create a new simple project with Android Studio.

2) Find the gradle folder in the new project.

3) Use the export option in eclipse to create the build.gradle script. (Requires at least adt version 22.0)

4) Copy the gradle folder into the project you want to export to Android Studio.

5) Now try to import this project, u shall be able to select the wrapper check box.

This may resolve the problem you asked for, you can also set the Gradle home path and use the other option just fine.

Hope this helps!
