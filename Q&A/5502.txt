A:As CommonsWare said, your emulator is missing the library. The Google Maps Library's documentation's Overview page has info on how to create the right kind of virtual device for the emulator. The gist is:


  Launch the AVD Manager by using the android command without any options. If you are developing in Eclipse/ADT, you can also access the tool from Window > Android SDK and AVD Manager.
  
  
  Click the "New" button to begin creating a new AVD.
  In the dialog that appears, specify a name for the AVD and select the system image target that you want the AVD to use. Select one of the "Google APIs (Google Inc.)" targets, making sure to choose a version whose API Level matches the android:minSdkVersion attribute in your application's manifest, as described above.
  Configure the other options and then click "Create AVD".
  
  
  Once you've finished creating the AVD, you can run it from the AVD Manager UI or you can use the emulator's command-line interface. If you are developing in Eclipse, you can configure a Run Configuration to start the AVD and install your application on it.
  
  For more information about AVDs, see Android Virtual Devices on the Android Developers site.
