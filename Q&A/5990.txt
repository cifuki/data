Q:What is the difference between these two listeners,documentation says :

OnItemSelectedListener - Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when an item in this view has been selected.

OnItemClickListener - Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when an item in this AdapterView has been clicked.

Selection,Click aren't these equal on touch screen?
