Q:I searched a lot on the web, but I haven't found anything which answered my question.
When I enable MyLocation with 


  gmap.setMyLocationEnabled(true)


I automatically get a button to center the map on my current location.
I want to remove it and so I'm asking you how to do this.
I hope somebody of you can help me!

A:After calling the following methods on your GoogleMap object:

map.setMyLocationEnabled(true);
map.getUiSettings().setMyLocationButtonEnabled(false);


you should see the current location indicator (the blue circle), but no control to center the map on that location.
