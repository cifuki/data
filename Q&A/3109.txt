Q:Ok folks.. long story short, I was developing on a computer that I no longer have access to. I was able to retrieve the source code, but not the .keystore file used to sign and publish my application to the market (with several updates). Am I, and my poor users, out of luck if I ever want to update?

I know the password used to sign the key (at least it is one of three it could be), so can I create another? There must be a way around this.. what about a hard drive fail?

A:Faced the same problem. I was trying to restore it via deleted files restoring tools, but it failed. So, there is no other way: you should issue another application.

Generally, the only advise that exists on keystores: "always back it up!"
