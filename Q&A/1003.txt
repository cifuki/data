Q:In Android Studio, where are the ProGuard mapping files generated after compiling a signed APK?

I'm not sure if it isn't working or if I just forgot the file path, and my compulsory Google/Stack Overflow search did not answer this

A:It should be located at build/outputs/proguard/release/mapping.txt in your application module's directory.

In the latest version of ProGuard and Android Studio, the file is located at build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt.
