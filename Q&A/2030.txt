Q:Is it possible to change the zoom level for myLocation with the new Google Maps API v2?
If you set GoogleMap.setEnableMyLocation(true); you get a button on the map to find your location. If you click on it, the map will bring you to your location and zoom it in to some level. Can I change this zoom to be less or more?

A:It's doubtful you can change it on click with the default myLocation Marker.  However, if you would like the app to automatically zoom in on your location once it is found, I would check out my answer to this question

Note that the answer I provided does not zoom in, but if you modify the onLocationChanged method to be like the one below, you can choose whatever zoom level you like:

@Override
public void onLocationChanged(Location location) 
{
    if( mListener != null )
    {
        mListener.onLocationChanged( location );

        //Move the camera to the user's location and zoom in!
        mMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoom(new LatLng(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude()), 12.0f));
    }
}
