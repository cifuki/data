Q:How do I clear all the EditText fields in a layout with a Clear Button.  I have a registration Activity that has about 10 different EditTexts.  I know I could go and grab a reference to each specifically and then set.Text("");  But I am looking for a more dynamic elegant way.  Possibly grab the Layout and loop through all the items in there looking for EditText types and then setting those to "".  Not sure how to do that though and tried searching on the web for it but no luck.  Any sample code?

A:The answer by @Pixie is great but I would like to make it much better.

This method works fine only if all the EditText are in a single(one) layout but when there are bunch of nested layouts this code doesn't deal with them.

After scratching my head a while I've made following solution:

private void clearForm(ViewGroup group) {       
    for (int i = 0, count = group.getChildCount(); i < count; ++i) {
        View view = group.getChildAt(i);
        if (view instanceof EditText) {
            ((EditText)view).setText("");
        }

        if(view instanceof ViewGroup && (((ViewGroup)view).getChildCount() > 0))
            clearForm((ViewGroup)view);
    }
}


To use this method just call this in following fashion:

clearForm((ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.sign_up));


Where you can replace your R.id.sign_up with the id of root layout of your XML file.

I hope this would help many people as like me.
