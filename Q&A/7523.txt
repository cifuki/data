Q:I have an activity that has android:windowIsTranslucent set to true and android:windowBackground set to a translucent background. I just changed my target and compile sdk version to 27, and I get an exception when launching this activity now:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: Only fullscreen opaque activities can request orientation

Since this is a new sdk, there isn't anything online about it yet (and it seems to result from this line of code: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.git/+/master/core/java/android/app/Activity.java#987 )

Is there any way to get around this? The app doesn't crash if I take out android:screenOrientation="portrait" from my manifest for this activity, but I would like to be able to keep it like that.

A:I also faced the same problem.
As others said, If I deleted android:screenOrientation="portrait" or overrided it with android:screenOrientation="unspecified", then the exception was gone.
And it seems that the front activity's orientation follows the behind activity's orientation.

I thought about it.
If the front activity is transparent and the behind activity's orientation is different,
the display becomes strange.
So, I can understand why this check logic was added
However, I wonder that why this problem was not occurred in Developer Preview 8.0.0.
