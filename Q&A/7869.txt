Q:I have an Android Library Project that contains several styles/themes defined in its styles.xml file.

Normally, when referencing this style in some other xml layout or manifest file, you would just write android:theme="@style/TheNameOfTheStyle"

When using a library project, how does the dependent project properly reference that style now?  Just leaving it as android:theme="@style/TheNameOfTheStyle" gives me an error saying there is no resource found matching that name.

I guess this same question applies for other references like @string, @color etc.

Thanks

Edit: Ok so it appears that you are suppose to reference it just like normal, but the console in eclipse is giving me this error: 


  Error: No resource found that matches
  the given name (at 'theme' with value '@style/ThemeName').


(facepalm) Edit

I just needed to "Clean Project" in Eclipse.  Now it's working.

A:Its important to build the project after adding resources (or just have autobuild on) and cleaning the project helps most of the times. Restarting Eclipse when "something" go wrong is a good idea, too. 

Also note that Android merges the recources, so the last project that is build "wins" the name. For this reason it's a good idea to prefix ALL resources somehow.
