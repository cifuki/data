Q:I do not understand this process at all. I have been able to navigate to the folder containing the keytool in the Java SDK. Although I keep getting the error openssl not recognised as an internal or external command. The problem is even if I can get this to work, what would I do and with what afterwards?

A:Here is what you need to do -

Download openSSl from Code
Extract it. create a folder- OpenSSL in C:/ and copy the extracted code here.

detect debug.keystore file path. If u didn't find, then do a search in C:/ and use the Path in the command in next step.

detect your keytool.exe path and go to that dir/ in command prompt and run this command in 1 line-

$ keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator.android\\debug.keystore" | "C:\\OpenSSL\\bin\\openssl" sha1 -binary |"C:\\OpenSSL\\bin\\openssl" base64


it will ask for password, put android
that's all. u will get a key-hash
