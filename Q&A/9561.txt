A:You should set layout margin like below, in your edittext in .xml file

 android:layout_marginLeft="5dp"


you can do that for marginTop Bottom, Right and left , depends on your requirement. You must specify this on the layout elements, not on the layout itself.

difference between padding and Margin:-
Padding related to space inside view, and Margin is the space outside view or space between two views,


  if space required outside view in any one direction, can be achieved as given above. and if space required on all side of view surroundings below tag can be useful


android:layout_margin="5dp"
