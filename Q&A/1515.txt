Q:I'm new to Android development and the development tools around it. I have checked out a project from svn using TortoiseSVN client (can't manage to do it from within Android Studio), then get this error message after importing the project to Android Studio:


  can't use subversion command line client : svn
  
  Probably the path to Subversion executable is wrong. Fix it..


When I click "Fix it" link, this dialog pops up:



But I still have no idea what I am supposed to do to fix this? Any kind of help/suggestion/direction to fix the problem are welcome.

A:Android Studio cannot find the svn command because it's not on PATH, and it doesn't know where svn is installed.

One way to fix is to edit the PATH environment variable: add the directory that contains svn.exe. You will need to restart Android Studio to make it re-read the PATH variable.

Another way is to set the absolute path of svn.exe in the Use command client box in the settings screen that you included in your post.

UPDATE

According to this other post, TortoiseSVN doesn't include the command line tools by default. But you can re-run the installer and enable it. That will add svn.exe to PATH, and Android Studio will correctly pick it up.
