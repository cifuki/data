Q:When launching my application in eclipse 3.7.0 I receive an error...

Emulator] emulator: ERROR: Unable to load Vm from snapshot. The snapshot has been saved for a different hardware configuration.

I have ran this application numersous times with out error but now this error displays. I have checked my AVD Manager and my platform and API Level are correct.

A:The problem isn't with your app, it is with the saved AVD snapshot.  The AVD configuration has been edited since you last ran it successfully.  Even changing skin/display resolution will produce this error.  You could either:


Change the AVD configuration back to how it was originally.
Edit the AVD to disable the Snapshot.
or
When you next start the AVD, uncheck the Launch with snapshot, but keep Save snapshot checked.  This way the snapshot will be ignored at start-up, but overwritten when you exit.  You will then be able to use snapshot for subsequent runs as before.
