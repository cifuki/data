Q:I am new to android development and just finished my first app. I want to generate a signed apk in android studio. I read the developer docs but couldn't understand the steps. When I click on Build>Generate Signed APK..., it shows me a dialog box asking the following:

Keystore path  //with two options create new and choose existing
Keystore password
Key alias
key password


I don't get what is keystore even after googling it. When I choose create new it asks me to select a path and locate a .jks file which I don't have! Can anyone please explain and list the steps in order to generate a signed apk.

A:Use Keytool binary or exe to generate a private keystore. Instructions here. You can then sign your app using this keystore. Keytool gets installed when you install Java.

NOTE: Save/backup this keystore because once you publish an app on play by signing it with this keystore, you will have to use the same keystore for any future updates. So, it's important that you back it up.

HTH.
