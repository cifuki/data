Q:Cannot debug application com.domain.test on device samsung-gt_i9300-323020cfc86b804f.
This application does not have the debuggable attribute enabled in its manifest.
If you have manually set it in the manifest, then remove it and let the IDE automatically assign it.
If you are using Gradle, make sure that your current variant is debuggable.

A:Your comment has already hinted the answer to this post but since you have not selected an answer I'll write it down.

Change build variant from release to debug from android studio left corner.
