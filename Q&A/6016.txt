Q:When using the Android support library for compatibility and try to view the javadoc for, say, FragmentTransaction, I get the following error because there is no associated javadoc file:


  android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction
  
  Note: This element neither has attached source nor attached Javadoc
  and hence no Javadoc could be found.


The support library is added under the Android Dependencies item in the project properties, and shows Javadoc location: (None) - non-modifiable as shown below.  Is there any workaround for this?

A:I've lashed together a project with android-support-v4.jar just in the Android Dependencies part of the package view. I have a class

public class CountriesFragment extends ListFragment {...}


and an import of 

import android.support.v4.app.ListFragment;


up above

I created a file android-support-v4.jar.properties in the libs folder. It contains the lines:

doc=c:\\\\[path-to-android-sdk]\\\\docs\\\\reference
src=C:\\\\[path-to-android-sdk]\\\\extras\\\\android\\\\support\\\\v4\\\\src


Presumably you'll have to change to un-escaped forward slashes if not using Windows.

Next right-click the project, select refresh, then you'll get javadoc support.  You don't really need the doc entry--the src entry already contains the javadocs.
