Q:I would like to use Android-x86 2.2 as an emulator on my Windows 7. I have downloaded VirtualBox and the ISO, and I've made a virtual machine with it, but I can't set the resolution to 320x480 or something similar.  

The following tutorial "Using the Android-x86 Port as your Emulator" suggests to insert:  

<ExtraDataItem name="CustomVideoMode2" value="320x480x16" />


to my .vbox file and I did it. Then I added UVESA_MODE=320x480 and vga=ask to the boot config. When it boots, I have to press Enter to see the available options, but there is no 320x480 among them.  How can I get it to work?

A:To change the Android-x86 screen resolution on VirtualBox you need to:


Add custom screen resolution:
Android <6.0:

VBoxManage setextradata "VM_NAME_HERE" "CustomVideoMode1" "320x480x16"


Android >=6.0:

VBoxManage setextradata "VM_NAME_HERE" "CustomVideoMode1" "320x480x32"

Figure out what is the \xe2\x80\x98hex\xe2\x80\x99-value for your VideoMode:
2.1. Start the VM
2.2. In GRUB menu enter a (Android >=6.0: e)
2.3. In the next screen append vga=ask and press Enter
2.4. Find your resolution and write down/remember the 'hex'-value for Mode column
Translate the value to decimal notation (for example 360 hex is 864 in decimal).
Go to menu.lst and modify it:
4.1. From the GRUB menu select Debug Mode
4.2. Input the following:  

mount -o remount,rw /mnt  
cd /mnt/grub  
vi menu.lst


4.3. Add vga=864 (if your \xe2\x80\x98hex\xe2\x80\x99-value is 360). Now it should look like this:  


  kernel /android-2.3-RC1/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot_hardware=eeepc acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode DPI=160 UVESA_MODE=320x480 SRC=/android-2.3-RC1 SDCARD=/data/sdcard.img vga=864


4.4. Save it:

:wq

Unmount and reboot:

cd /
umount /mnt
reboot -f



Hope this helps.
