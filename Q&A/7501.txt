Q:I have an annoying problem with TextWatcher. i've been searching the web but couldnt find anything. appreciate if someone could assist me.

For some reason the calls to the TextWatcher events upon one text change are erratic. sometimes they are being triggered once (like they should be), sometimes twice, and sometimes 3 times. have no idea why, the whole thing is very straight forward. also sometimes the Editable parameter on afterTextChanged() returns empty values in toString() and length().

code is below:

    private TextWatcher mSearchAddressTextChangeListener = new TextWatcher() {
        @Override
        public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int before, int count) { }

        @Override
        public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int count, int after) { }

        @Override
        public void afterTextChanged(Editable searchedAddress) {
           System.out.println("called multiple times.");   
        }
    };


inside afterTextChanged() (and the AsyncTask) im not making any change to the text or the EditText view.

i saw the question asked in Events of TextWatcher are being called twice, but im having the events triggered more (or less) than twice.

anyway, appreciate any help.

EDIT: I removed the content of afterTextChanged() cause this problem is happening even without my code. what leads me to believe this is a bug. The bug is occuring when a 'space' char is entered right after a regular char (event handlers are triggered twice) or when a 'space' char after a regular char is removed (backspace. event handlers are triggered 3 times). help will still be appreciated.

A:I had the same kind of problem, when I pressed backspace with cursor at the end of a continuous text, afterTextChange was called 3 times:
- The first time with the correct s value
- The second time with a clear value
- The third time with the correct value again

After having search a lot on the web, I tried to change my EditText inputType to

android:inputType="textNoSuggestions"


Don't ask me why, but it worked, afterTextChanged is now called only once.
