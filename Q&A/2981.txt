Q:I have updated my SDK and ADT to the latest version, I have also update the Eclipse to Kepler the latest one after Juno. 

My ADT version is 22.0. After this update when I create a new project, I'm getting error, stating R cannot be resolved to a variable. I have imported import android.R;, but it is showing as unused import stating Don't include android.R here; use a fully qualified name for each usage instead. 

Same thing is happening with Mac OS also with the latest update. I have tried renaming activity_main.xml to other name, but still my R.java is not generated. 

Tried all the things which are possible. Cleaned the project, build the whole workspace. Nothing helping.

I think ADT or Eclipse compatibility is having problem after the update.

I have updated my whole SDK, here is the screenshot, but same problem is there.

A:After updating to SDK Tools to rev. 22 for the first time, you may need to relaunch Android SDK Manager again and install a new item: Android SDK Build-tools.


After installing this, clean your projects and rebuild.
