Q:I have an Android application which sends some data to a webservice. I need to send this data as soon as the application is closed or sent to background.. But how do I accomplish this?

My current solution is to run it on the OnPause() on my home activity, but I need this to run no matter which activity the user is on when closing the app.. Is this possible or do I have to add the OnPause method to all activities?

A:Edit

This answer only serves for one purpose, that is, running a code in onPause() for all activities. It doesn't let you run a code when your app is sent to background.

Original Answer

Make an Activity named YourBasicActivity and override its onPause() method and extend every Activity from YourBasicActivity
