Q:After upgrading to Android version 6.0 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning will only work if Location services are enabled on the device. See here for reference: Bluetooth Low Energy startScan on Android 6.0 does not find devices

Basically, you need to have the permission enabled for the app as well as on for the phone.  Is this a bug? Is it possible to scan without location services actually enabled? I don't want to have to have location for all my apps. 

EDIT 
I failed to mention that I am using the startScan() method in BluetoothLeScanner provided in API 21. I am okay with the course and fine location permissions in the manifest that this method require. I just don't want the users of my app to have to enable location services on their device (GPS, etc.) to use my app. 

Previously, the startScan() method would run and return results with the Location services disabled on the phone. On Marshmallow, however, the same application would "scan" but silently failed and returned no results when location services were not enabled on the phone and course/fine location permissions were still in the manifest.

A:No, this is not a bug. 

This issue was brought up to Google where they responded saying that this was the intended behavior and they won't fix it. They directed developers to this site where it points out that location permission is now needed for hardware identifier access.  It is now the developer's responsibility to make their users aware of the requirement.

In the issue, however, it doesn't address why Location services (GPS, etc.) are required and it doesn't seem like they are going to revisit the issue to explain this since it has been marked as the intended behavior.

To answer the second part of the question: Yes, it is possible to scan without enabling Location services. You can do a Bluetooth classic scan using BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter().startDiscovery() and that will work with Location services off. This will discover all Bluetooth devices, BLE and otherwise. However, BLE devices won't have a scan record that they would have had if they were seen as a result of startScan().
