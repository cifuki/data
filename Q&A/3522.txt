Q:I have a public abstract class and I'm trying to use the getClass() method, as I will need info from the class extending my abstract class. An example is this:

public String getName() {
    return getClass().getSimpleName();
}


However, IntelliJ reports this:

Ambiguous method call. Both
getClass    ()    in Object and
getClass    ()    in Object match.


The code runs fine, but having tens of error warnings in my IDE is kinda in my way. It disrupts my work flow with a lot of false positives.

Why are these errors shown, and what can I do to not see them?

A:Casting my getClass() call to Object like this

((Object) this).getClass()


solves the problem (with non abstract classes) for me.
It's not great, but it's working.

Also, manipulating your Android SDKs from the project settings and removing all JDK jars from your Android SDK resolves the error. Of course you'll have to reference it within your project to utilize the fix.
