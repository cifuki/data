Q:In Android 2.3 and below, you could make an application full screen, and then "hijack" the menu/back/search buttons by just returning false onKeyDown()... and registering the app as a default home launcher application, that way, there's no way to exit the application.

In Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) the navigation buttons (System Bar) is always present, I'd like to hide it. Is it possible?

FYI, I am not publishing this application on the Android Market. This is an internal application for devices that are going to be used internally, I need to secure the device.

A:You cannot hide the system bar on Android 3.0.
