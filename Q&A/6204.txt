Q:I am using Android studio 2.2 on windows 10.

I am trying to import an existing android project. The problem that it took forever and still showing the message 


  Building 'ProjecTName' Graedle project info


after that android studio is totally getting stuck and i kill it from the task manager !

I tried the available options on Android Studio list:


Open an existing Android Studio Project
Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)

A:There is downloading of Gradle going on at the background. Just wait for it to finish.
