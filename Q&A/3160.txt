Q:Is it possible to make EditText clickable but not editable.

I don't want it to be editable (Neither should the keyboard come up nor should we be able to change the hint)

Actually I want to use Edit text simply as an image with a hint (which cannot be changed). I know the actual way was to use an ImageView and one TextView, but I want it to try with EditText because I'll then be using only one view instead of 2. Also every thing is dynamic so no XML.

For the above requirement the solution in XML is android:editable="false" but I want to use this in Java.

But,

If I use :- 

et.setEnabled(false);


or

 et.setKeyListener(null);


It makes the EditText not EDITABLE but at the same time it makes it non clickable as well.

A:The trick here is :-  

et.setFocusable(false);
et.setClickable(true);
