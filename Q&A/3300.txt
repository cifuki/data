Q:I am new to phonegap and android development. May I know how can I debug javascript error on the emulator? I have heard about ADB may I know how can I use and install it on windows 7 system? I have an ajax called with jsonp but no response on emulator. However, I can call that ajax with browser on windows. May I know what went wrong?

A:You could at least log debug stuff to the adb console by calling console.log() in JavaScript. Maybe that would suffice?

To view log output using adb, navigate to your SDK platform-tools/ directory and execute:

adb logcat


See logcat Command-line Tool
