Q:I am working with Android Animation and I have found the Android coordinate system to be quite confusing so I am here to ask this question about how coordinates work in Android. I am following this image for moving one view to another but it seems it's not working:

A:This image presents both orientation(Landscape/Portrait)

To get MaxX and MaxY, read on.

For Android device screen coordinates,  below concept will work.

Display mdisp = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay();
Point mdispSize = new Point();
mdisp.getSize(mdispSize);
int maxX = mdispSize.x; 
int maxY = mdispSize.y;


EDIT:- ** **for devices supporting android api level older than 13. Can use below code.

    Display mdisp = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay();
    int maxX= mdisp.getWidth();
    int maxY= mdisp.getHeight();


(x,y) :-

1) (0,0) is top left corner.

2)  (maxX,0) is top right corner

3) (0,maxY) is bottom left corner

4) (maxX,maxY) is bottom right corner

here maxX and maxY are screen maximum height and width in pixels, which we have retrieved in above given code.
