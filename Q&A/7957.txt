Q:How to select subset of characters in many lines (column selection) in Eclipse/Android Studio?
Ideally without plugins. Shift+Alt+A seems not to be working for me either.

In Notepad++ you can do it with Shift+Alt+(Arrows) or Alt+Left_Mouse (and drag to select)

Please see example below (Column selection I'm after):

Visual Studio and many other tools support it.

Thanks

A:I use android studio. You can switch between selection mode by:
alt-shift-insert, or Edit -> Column selection mode.
