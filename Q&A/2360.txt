Q:I'm using an EditText inside a TextInputLayout, but after upgrading the support library to 23.2.0, I get this warning in the logcat, What's the difference between a regular EditText and a TextInputEditText? I can't seem to find any documentation for it.

A:I was wondering this too, Daniel Wilson gathered the documentation, but to the untrained eye it doesn't mean much. Here's what it's all about: "extract mode" is referring to the type of view that's shown when the space is too small, for example landscape on a phone. I'm using Galaxy S4 with Google Keyboard as IME.

Landscape UI without visible IME

Based on the focus (on Description) you can see TextInputLayout in action pushing the hint outside the editor. Nothing special here, this is what TextInputLayout is supposed to do.



Landscape UI editing empty Name field

Editing the Name you can see that the IME doesn't give you a hint of what you're editing.



Landscape UI editing empty Description field

Editing the Description you can see that the IME gives you a hint of what you're editing.



Layout XMLs

The difference between the two fields is their type EditText VS TextInputEditText. The important thing here is that TextInputLayout has the android:hint and not the wrapped EditText, this is the case when TextInputEditText's few lines of Java code makes a big difference.

Name field

<android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:hint="Item Name"
    >
    <EditText
        android:id="@+id/name"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        />
</android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout>


Description field

<android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:hint="Item Description"
    >
    <android.support.design.widget.TextInputEditText
        android:id="@+id/description"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:inputType="textMultiLine"
        android:minLines="4"
        android:scrollbars="vertical"
        />
</android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout>
