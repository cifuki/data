Q:My application needs to create a small ProgressBar programmatically.
ProgressBar doesn't have a method to set the style (I want a small
ProgressBar). The constructor can take an AttributeSet, however, it is an
interface and requires me to implement a set of functions. Is there a way
to set the ProgressBar to a small style? (I can't use XML to create
ProgressBar.)

A:Most of the time if you provide an AttributeSet manually you have to use one of Android's.  Luckily, they've exposed the attribute set that describes a small progress bar.  Use this code:

progressBar = new ProgressBar(activity, null, android.R.attr.progressBarStyleSmall);
