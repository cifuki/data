A:You need to download and install git from http://git-scm.com/downloads

Then you need to track the git.exe on AndroidStudio:


Go to Settings > Project Settings > Version Control > VCSs > Git > Path to Git executable
Select (or type) executable path, eg: D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe


If you installed GitHub Desktop for Windows

In case you have GitHub Desktop for Windows, git.exe will be found at C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_c7e0cbde92ba565zz218z5214zzz0e854zzza28\\cmd.
