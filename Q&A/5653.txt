Q:Here's the output:


  11:57:04 AM Gradle 'KeddreaderProject' project refresh failed: Cause:
  org.gradle.internal.service.ServiceLocator.([Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V:


I've tried to remove .gradle folder, but it doesn't help. What can be the problem?

Edit: I get this error even when I try to import any other project on Ubuntu 13.10. But on Windows everything works (with the the same version of Android Studio) well.

A:Most people do not read the comments so to summarize (Thanks to @Industrial-antidepressant and @wrecker):

As suggested in a bug ticket you should try the following:


Close Android Studio
go to android-studio/plugins/gradle/lib
Delete (or better move them somewhere to have a backup) all gradle-*-1.8 files
Start Android Studio again and rebuild/refresh.


It should work. Make sure to star the above bug ticket to get informed.

Little tip:
Try the new compile setting Settings -> Compiler -> Gradle and activate the third in-process build for a speed up. Depending on your project setting you might want to select the first one as well. With that my project build time reduced to 2-4 seconds (before 20+ seconds).
