As if the latest version of AS there is now a Preference in the UI noted in an answer by Yogesh Umesh Vaity

Original Answer

The simple way to revert a mistaken choice is to close Android Studio then edit other.xml file and remove the myIgnoredBuildNumbers option block:

<option name="myIgnoredBuildNumbers">
  <value>
    <list size="1">
      <item index="0" class="java.lang.String" itemvalue="130.729444" />
    </list>
  </value>
</option>


Technically you should edit the size and remove the item in question but after some testing the next time you ignore a build the myIgnoredBuildNumbers block will be rebuilt.

The other.xml file can be found at:


OSX: ~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio/options/other.xml
WIN: %HOMEPATH%\\.AndroidStudio\\config\\options\\other.xml
NIX: ~/.AndroidStudio/config/options/other.xml


The same can be done in Intellij in the following paths:


OSX: ~/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC12/options/other.xml
WIN: %HOMEPATH%\\.IdeaIC12\\options\\other.xml


As of Android Studio 1.2(possibly earlier), the ignored builds block is defined in updates.xml within the same directory as other.xml
