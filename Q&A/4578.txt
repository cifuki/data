Q:In my application I have a single EditText together with some TextViews, button and a spinner. My EditText receives focus since it is the only focusable view in this activity, I believe. My EditText shows with an orange border and cursor on the field.  

Now I would like to remove the focus from this field (I don't want the cursor and border to show). Is there a way to do this?  

I have been able to focus on the button by doing button.seFocusableInTouchMode() and button.requestFocus(). But this highlights the button and is obviously not what I want.

A:check this question and the selected answer: Stop EditText from gaining focus at Activity startup It's ugly but it works, and as far as I know there's no better solution.
