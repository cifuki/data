Q:My android application, built inside Eclipse, suddenly fails to build with dozens of errors.  The most obvious are errors indicating that all the android imports cannot be resolved.

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;
import android.media.AudioManager;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.ImageView;


All of these are flagged as unresolvable.  I've tried removing and re-adding the JRE System Library.  I've tried cleaning and rebuilding.  I've tried the "Quick fix" option to "Fix Project Setup..." but that simply responds with a dialog box that say...

"No proposals have been found to fix the unresolvable reference to 'android.app.Bundle'.  Click here to manually configure the build path of project 'Silent Mode Toggle."

I'm new to Android development and this one has me completely stumped.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

A:It seems that your eclipse-workspace (or at least your Project) is broken somehow. 

Have you moved your android-sdk/Project recently? If it's not an Android Project anymore, try to look at Preferences->Android for a valid android sdk-location. 

If this is correct, try to open a complete new Workspace, and import your sources with File->import->Android Project from existing Source. 

If this still doesn't help, make a new android Project and copy the sources manually inside your Project from outside Eclipse. Re-open Eclipse after that, and make a Project->clean
