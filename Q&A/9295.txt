Q:I just updated google play services to rev 22 and the LocationClient class appears to be missing. What is going on?

A:Building on what @CommnsWare said, here are steps to migrate to Fused api.

Step 1: Get an instance of GoogleApiClient instead of LocationClient.

The ConnectionCallback (mConnectionCallbacks, mOnConnectionFailedListener in example below) needs slight modification but that should be trivial.

googleApiClient = new GoogleApiClient.Builder(this)
        .addApi(LocationServices.API)
        .addConnectionCallbacks(mConnectionCallbacks)
        .addOnConnectionFailedListener(mOnConnectionFailedListener)
        .build();


Step 2: Update connect and disconnect calls.

Replace the locationClient.connect() with googleApiClient.connect() and locationClient.disconnect() with googleApiClient.disconnect().

Step 3: Use LocationServices.FusedLocationApi to send your requests.
 e.g.

LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.getLastLocation(googleApiClient)
LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.requestLocationUpdates(googleApiClient, request, mLocationListener);


Hope this helps!
