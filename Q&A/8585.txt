Q:I have made a shared preference activity that store the user settings, now i want to get values in a activity or normal java class.please provide a solution or example i have already tried this code but failed.

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
{
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    SharedPreferences channel=this.getSharedPreferences(strFile, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
    strChannel=channel.getString(keyChannel,"Default").toString();
    Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), strChannel, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}                     


in this code strfile for eg. com.android.pack.ClassName is SharedPreference Activity from values to be fetched, and keyChannel is key that is same in SharedPreference Activity.

Kindly provide the solution.

A:If you have a SharedPreferenceActivity by which you have saved your values 

SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
String imgSett = prefs.getString(keyChannel, "");


if the value is saved in a SharedPreference in an Activity then this is the correct way to saving it.

SharedPreferences shared = getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = shared.edit();
editor.putString(keyChannel, email);
editor.commit();// commit is important here.


and this is how you can retrieve the values.

SharedPreferences shared = getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE);
String channel = (shared.getString(keyChannel, ""));


Also be aware that you can do so in a non-Activity class too but the only condition is that you need to pass the context of the Activity. use this context in to get the SharedPreferences.

mContext.getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE);
