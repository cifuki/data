Q:I'm trying to create a DialogFragment using my own Layout. 

I've seen a couple different approaches.  Sometimes the layout is set in OnCreateDialog like this:
(I'm using Mono but I've gotten somewhat used to Java)

public override Android.App.Dialog OnCreateDialog (Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    base.OnCreateDialog(savedInstanceState);
    AlertDialog.Builder b = new AlertDialog.Builder(Activity);
        //blah blah blah
    LayoutInflater i = Activity.LayoutInflater;
    b.SetView(i.Inflate(Resource.Layout.frag_SelectCase, null));
    return b.Create();
}


This first approach works for me... until I want to use findViewByID.
so after a bit of googling I tried the second approach which involves overriding OnCreateView

So I commented out two lines of OnCreateDialog that set the Layout and then added this:

public override Android.Views.View OnCreateView (LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    View v = inflater.Inflate(Resource.Layout.frag_SelectCase, container, false);
        //should be able to use FindViewByID here...
    return v;
}


which gives me a lovely error:

11-05 22:00:05.381: E/AndroidRuntime(342): FATAL EXCEPTION: main
11-05 22:00:05.381: E/AndroidRuntime(342): android.util.AndroidRuntimeException: requestFeature() must be called before adding content


I'm stumped.

I would guess that you are not scoping findViewById() to the View returned by inflate(), try this:

View view = i.inflate(Resource.Layout.frag_SelectCase, null);
// Now use view.findViewById() to do what you want
b.setView(view);

return b.create();
