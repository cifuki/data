Q:I am trying to start up a BroadcastReceiver within a Service. What I am trying to do is have a background running service going that collects incoming text messages, and logs incoming phone calls. I figured the best way to go about this is to have a service running that incorporates a broadcast receiver that can catalog either. 

How do i go about doing this? I already have my service up and running.

A:as your service is already setup, simply add a broadcast receiver in your service:

private final BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
   @Override
   public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
      String action = intent.getAction();
      if(action.equals("android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED")){
        //action for sms received
      }
      else if(action.equals(android.telephony.TelephonyManager.ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED)){
           //action for phone state changed
      }     
   }
};


in your service's onCreate do this:

IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
filter.addAction("android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED");
filter.addAction(android.telephony.TelephonyManager.ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED);
filter.addAction("your_action_strings"); //further more
filter.addAction("your_action_strings"); //further more

registerReceiver(receiver, filter);


and in your service's onDestroy:

unregisterReceiver(receiver);


and you are good to go to receive broadcast for what ever filters you mention in onCreate. Make sure to add any permission if required. for e.g.

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS" />
