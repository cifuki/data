Q:I have some classes within my application that need to call Android functions that require the Context as a parameter.
I don't have it as the class is not a subclass of the Activity class.

What is the correct way to tackle this problem?


Pass it as a parameter on each call?
Pass it at class instantiation and keep it?

A:It depends on the role of the class. But anyway pass ApplicationContext but not Activity one. If you pass Activity context gc can't remove it from the memory when after you don't need activity anymore. But application context is used while application was not finished by OS.Refer Avoid Memory Leaks
