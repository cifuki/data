Q:I'm trying to build my android project using gradle and circleCI, but I've got this error :

* What went wrong:
  A problem occurred configuring root project '<myproject>'.
  > Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':classpath'.
> Could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3.
 Searched in the following locations:

Can someone explain me why I've got this problem please?

A:It seems the current versions of the Android Gradle plugin are not added to Maven Central, but they are present on jcenter. Add jcenter() to your list of repositories and Gradle should find version 2.2.3. On Maven Central the newest available version is 2.1.3: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.android.tools.build%22%20AND%20a%3A%22gradle%22. You can also complain to the authors that the current versions are missing on Maven Central.
