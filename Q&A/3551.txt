Q:I have an android application which uses a third party jar in it. 
Http request is sent from third party jar to server when application is running. 
I need to capture HTTP Request that is sent from third party jar. I am wondering if there is an easy way to implement with non-rooted device

To start up : 
I tried downloading "proxyDroid" but it need rooted phone
I have also tried downloading "shark for root" with "shark reader" which also need rooted device
I tried many other applications which could capture the complete request but all it need is rooted device

I need something what fiddler/wireshark can do for windows. A network packet analyzer which could be easily integrated with android application that could give request object with all header fields in it.

A:You could install Charles - an HTTP proxy / HTTP monitor / Reverse Proxy that enables a developer to view all of the HTTP and SSL / HTTPS traffic between their machine and the Internet - on your PC or MAC.

Config steps:


Let your phone and PC or MAC in a same LAN
Launch Charles which you installed (default proxy port is 8888)
Setup your phone's wifi configuration: set the ip of delegate to your PC or MAC's ip, port of delegate to 8888
Lauch your app in your phone. And monitor http requests on Charles.
