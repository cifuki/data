A:Try putting your LinearLayout inside an ScrollView like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="fill_parent">

    <LinearLayout android:id="@+id/menu_ll"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="fill_parent"></LinearLayout>

</ScrollView>
