Q:What is the proper way to expand a CardView?

A:Use an expandable list view with cardview


or even 


  You can use wrap content as height of cardview and use
  textview inside it below title, so on click make the textview visible
  and vice-versa.


but isn't it bad design ?


  nope it isn't if you give some transition or animation when it's expanded
  or collapsed
  
  If you want to see some default transition then just write android:animateLayoutChanges="true" in parent layout.
