Q:I'm trying to return the location selected by the user in the Google Maps Android application, but I can't seem to find information about how to achieve this task.

I created an Intent to open the GMaps Activity, but the user can't select a point on the map nor does the Activity return a point to my application when it is closed.

I'm using startActiviyForResult, since I'm expecting a result back from the Activity.

A:use Google API. You just need to create your own MapActivity with MapView.
Here is great tutorial on Google API Including receiving location on finger taps. Hope this will help.
