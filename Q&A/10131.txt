Q:I've downloaded Android SDK Documentation using SDK Manager, to use it with Android Studio v2.3.0.8, offline.

But everytime I press ctrl+q to show quick info about a type|type-member, it shows "Fetching Documentation...", and after waiting for ~20s, it shows the info.

I don't want that delay or using online help, and the local docs are in place, so why is that ?
And what is the solution ?

Edit: This happens when I'm online, but no delay at all when I'm offline, 
As if the IDE tries to get a fresh version of docs.

A:Improved solution for displaying documentation (from sources).

Found, that if you download documentation via SDK manager (it will be located in .../sdk/docs/reference), you're going to use only 24 API documentation. (Imagine, your project target SDK is 25 or 22, for instance).



To fix this, you need:


Delete documentation via SDK manager in Android Studio.

Right there, download sources for interested APIs (sources already contain documentation). Also I found, that fetching documentation from sources a bit faster comparing with offline one inside .../sdk/docs/reference.

Delete all javadoc paths from jdk.table.xml. Path to this file on OS X: /Users/.../Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio.../options/jdk.table.xml


--> Delete all of these and all occurrences -->

<javadocPath>
  <root type="composite">
    <root type="simple" url="http://developer.android.com/reference/" />
  </root>
</javadocPath>



Reboot Studio. Enjoy!
