Q:Just had a look at the demo app of new Android support design library. It's provided by Chris Banes on github. Throught the app, CoordinatorLayout is used Heavily. Also, many of the support design library classes such as FloatingActionButton, SnackBar, AppBarLayout etc. behaves differently when used inside CoordinatorLayout. 

Can someone please shed some lights on what is CoordinatorLayout and how it is different from other ViewGroups in android, or at least provide correct path towards learning CoordinatorLayout.

A:Here it is you are looking for.

from docs

the Design library introduces CoordinatorLayout, a layout which provides an additional level of control over touch events between child views, something which many of the components in the Design library take advantage of.

in this link you will see the demo videos of all above mentioned views.

hope this helps :)
