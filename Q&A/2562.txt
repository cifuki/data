Q:I'm developing an Android app and am interested to know how you can update the app user's status from within the app using Android's share intents.

Having looked through Facebook's SDK it appears that this is easy enough to do, however I'm keen to allow the user to do it via the regular Share Intent pop up window? seen here: 



I have tried the usual share intent code, however this no longer appears to work for Facebook.

public void invokeShare(Activity activity, String quote, String credit) {
    Intent shareIntent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND);
    shareIntent.setType("text/plain");
    shareIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, activity.getString(R.string.share_subject));
    shareIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "Example text");    

    activity.startActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, activity.getString(R.string.share_title)));
}


UPDATE:
Having done more digging, it looks as though it's a bug with Facebook's app that has yet to be resolved! (facebook bug) For the mean time it looks like I'm just going to have to put up with the negative "Sharing doesn't work!!!" reviews. Cheers Facebook :*(

A:The Facebook application does not handle either the EXTRA_SUBJECT or EXTRA_TEXT fields.


Here is bug link: https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/332619626816423

Thanks @billynomates:


  The thing is, if you put a URL in the EXTRA_TEXT field, it does
  work. It's like they're intentionally stripping out any text.
