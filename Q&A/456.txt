Q:When I add the RecyclerView to the layout, it shows up as a blank screen.  Is there a way, such as through the tools namespace, to show a preview of the content of the RecyclerView?

A:@oRRs is right !

I'm using Android Studio 1.4 RC2 and you can now specify any custom layout.

I tried a custom CardView and it works.

tools:listitem="@android:layout/simple_list_item_checked"
