Q:I have an issue with third party libraries that are imported to my project.

I read quite a lot of articles about that but do not get any information how properly handle it.

I put my classes .so to the folder.



Problem is that the i try to run the app i receive 

[INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS: Failed to extract native libraries, res=-113]

I was facing this issue in Android Studio 3.0.1 :

After checking lots of posts, here is Fix which works:

Go to module build.gradle and within Android block add this script:

splits {
    abi {
        enable true
        reset()
        include 'x86', 'armeabi-v7a', 'x86_64'
        universalApk true
    }
}


Simple Solution. Feel free to comment. Thanks.
