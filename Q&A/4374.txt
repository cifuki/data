Q:I was working on my app and everything was normal until I tried to display image in java.

I ran the app once and it ran normally, the picture was displayed.
After that it asked me to import some libraries and I imported them. After that I got errors for my activities.

Errors like:

Gradle: error: cannot find symbol variable activity_main
Gradle: error: cannot find symbol variable button1
Gradle: error: cannot find symbol variable button2
Gradle: error: cannot find symbol variable textView
Gradle: error: cannot find symbol variable secondActivity


In MainActivity I have imported these libraries: 

import android.R;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.widget.Button;


and in secondActivity these:

import android.R;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;


Does anyone know how to fix this?

EDIT: I deleted import android.R; and now it works normally.

A:You shouldn't be importing android.R.  That should be automatically generated and recognized.  This question contains a lot of helpful tips if you get some error referring to R after removing the import.

Some basic steps after removing the import, if those errors appear:


Clean your build, then rebuild
Make sure there are no errors or typos in your XML files
Make sure your resource names consist of [a-z0-9.].  Capitals or symbols are not allowed for some reason.
Perform a Gradle sync (via Tools > Android > Sync Project with Gradle Files)
