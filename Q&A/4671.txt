Q:I made a listView images. My goal that each item of my listView have the same height of 100dp. I encounter a problem that my imageView is resized automatically, but does not take the entire space of the parent.

Here is my current result and objectif result :



Does anyone know the option to add to make crop center automatically?

A:I am not sure if I understood correctly. It must be either of the two, that you want, I guess.

In your image view set the attribute

android:scaleType="fitXY"


to fit the ImageView completely.

You can choose 

android:scaleType="centerCrop"


to crop Center.
