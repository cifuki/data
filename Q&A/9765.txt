Q:For business reasons I'd like to restrict my Android application strictly to tablet devices. 

At the moment, I can limit the app to Honeycomb devices by setting:

android:minSdkVersion="11"


But the next version of Android (Ice Cream Sandwich) will have a higher version number for both the tablet and phone versions of the OS. 

Is there any manifest attribute I can specify to restrict it to tablet devices? (Honeycomb or any later tablet version)

A:You will find this link awesome: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/09/preparing-for-handsets.html

The problem with what we call "tablet" is that the definition is not the same for evryone.
I think about the Archos 5IT that is the same size than a phone but branded with "tablet" name. Same issue with Dell Streak.

I would personnaly not call that a tablet..

So if you want to restrict to 7 or 5 inches devices, you should use xlargeScreens and largeScreens. 

(There is also a bug in HTC flyer - 7 inches- that uses largeScreens, blame HTC)

I guess that playing with Screen size in Manifest will fit your needs:

<supports-screens android:smallScreens="false"
                  android:normalScreens="false"
                  android:largeScreens="false"
                  android:xlargeScreens="true"
                  android:anyDensity="true"
                  android:requiresSmallestWidthDp="600"
                  android:compatibleWidthLimitDp="integer"
                  android:largestWidthLimitDp="integer"/>
