Q:When using a custom thumb drawable with a SeekBar view, the thumb drawable is clipped at the left and right edges of the view.

How can I fix this behavior?

A:You should be able to fix this by setting paddingLeft and paddingRight on your SeekBar to half the thumb width (remember to use density-independent units). You can also control the space allowed at the edges for a seek bar's thumb by calling setThumbOffset.
