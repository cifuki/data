Q:I am using a Samsung galaxy nexus phone (Android 4.0 platform) .

I am developing Android app on Ubuntu linux OS. I would like to run my application directly on the Samsung handset device, so I performed the following setup steps:


in my project AndroidManifest.xml file, added android:debuggable="true" to the <application> element
On the device, in the Settings > Security enabled Unknown sources
On the device, in the Settings > Developer options enabled USB debugging
On my computer, created the /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules file with the following content:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04E8", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev" 

On my computer, run the chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules command


Then, on my computer I opened a terminal and executed the adb devices command, I got:

List of devices attached 
????????????    no permissions


Since I did not see my device but only ???????????? no permissions, I then run the following commands:

 adb kill-server
 adb start-server
 adb devices


But I still got:

List of devices attached 
????????????    no permissions


Why? What am I missing?

A:What works for me is to kill and start the adb server again. On linux: sudo adb kill-server and then sudo adb start-server. Then it will detect nearly every device out of the box.
