Q:I'm trying to change the color on a white marker image by code. I have read that the code below should change the color, but my marker remains white.

Drawable.setColorFilter( 0xffff0000, Mode.MULTIPLY )


Did I miss something? Is there any other way to change colors on my drawables located in my res folder?

A:Try this:

Drawable unwrappedDrawable = AppCompatResources.getDrawable(context, R.drawable.my_drawable); 
Drawable wrappedDrawable = DrawableCompat.wrap(unwrappedDrawable);
DrawableCompat.setTint(wrappedDrawable, Color.RED);    


Using DrawableCompat is important because it provides backwards compatibility and bug fixes on API 22 devices and earlier.
