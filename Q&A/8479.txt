Q:On Android, every single View subclass has a setVisibility() method that allows you modify the visibility of a View object

There are 3 options of setting the visibility:


Visible: Renders the View visible inside the layout
Invisible: Hides the View, but leaves a gap that is equivalent to what the View would occupy if it were visible
Gone: Hides the View, and removes it entirely from the layout. It's as if its height and width were 0dp


Is there something equivalent to the above for Widgets in Flutter?

A:UPDATE: Since this answer was written, Visibility was introduced and provides the best solution to this problem.



You can use Opacity with an opacity: of 0.0 to draw make an element hidden but still occupy space.

To make it not occupy space, replace it with an empty Container().

EDIT:
To wrap it in an Opacity object, do the following:

            new Opacity(opacity: 0.0, child: new Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.only(
                left: 16.0,
              ),
              child: new Icon(pencil, color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue),
            ))
