Q:After I am running ionic cordova build android I get this error:

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not resolve all files for configuration ':debugCompileClasspath'.
> Could not find runtime.jar (android.arch.lifecycle:runtime:1.0.0).
  Searched in the following locations:
  https://jcenter.bintray.com/android/arch/lifecycle/runtime/1.0.0/runtime-1.0.0.jar


And it is right. When I go to this URL https://jcenter.bintray.com/android/arch/lifecycle/runtime/1.0.0/runtime-1.0.0.jar I get an 404 Not found error as a JSON.

I don't see any android/ cordova specific versions in that URL so I can't say its from my cordova installation.

Cordova version: 7.1.0

Ionic info:

cli packages: (C:\\Users\\%User%\\AppData\\Roaming\
pm\
ode_modules)

    @ionic/cli-utils  : 1.19.2
    ionic (Ionic CLI) : 3.20.0

global packages:

    cordova (Cordova CLI) : not installed // this is strange. I can run cordova in my terminal tho

local packages:

    @ionic/app-scripts : 3.1.8
    Cordova Platforms  : android 6.4.0
    Ionic Framework    : ionic-angular 3.9.2

System:

    Android SDK Tools : 26.1.1
    Node              : v8.4.0
    npm               : 5.3.0
    OS                : Windows 10

Environment Variables:

    ANDROID_HOME : C:\\Users\\%User%\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

Misc:

    backend : pro


Also, I don't have any cordova-android  folders in C:\\Users\\%USER%\\.cordova\\lib\
pm_cache (I don't know if this helps. I saw people talking about this folder)

What's the problem here? Where is that URL coming from? How can I change it and with what can I change it? 

If I cannot solve this easily there is one last step to do: remove and install everything again.

Thank you!

A:A quick temporary fix is to include the google maven repo in your top level gradle file.

allprojects {
  repositories {
      mavenLocal()
      maven { url 'https://maven.google.com' } // <-- add this!
      jcenter()
