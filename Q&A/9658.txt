Q:I'm trying to write some code that will reference a bool.xml file and will reference the current value inside the bool.

<bool name="enableQAurl">true</bool>


With this I want to be able to reference this in code, so that if it's set to True it does something and if false does something else. Just a simple If and else statement.

Any code references or feedback is greatly appreciated.

A:Resources res = getResources();
 boolean enableQAurl = res.getBoolean(R.bool.enableQAurl);
