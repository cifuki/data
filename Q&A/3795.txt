Q:I'm developing for Android with Eclipse, and all was working well until yesterday. I used Ninite to update all my stuff, including JREs and everything (pro tip: do not do that), and it restarted my computer without asking in the middle of editing my workspace. 

This caused all kinds of filthy problems, but now it all works, except for Android. I've updated Android SDK and the eclipse ADT, then when I try to tell Eclipse the SDK location, it gives this error:


  This Android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 14.0.0 or
  above.  Current version is 12.0.0.v201106281929-138431.  Please update
  ADT to the latest version.


Now, this is an outright lie. My ADT is version 14.0.something. I've tried Help>Check for updates, it says there are no updates. I've tried Help>Install new software...>Available Software Sites and removing the ADT repo, then reinstalling ADT, and it says it failed because I already have version 14.0.whatever. 

How do I convince eclipse that my ADT is up to date??

A:I found the answer to the problem. (I'm using Helios, but it should work anyway)


Goto folder /Program Files(x86)/Eclipse/Plugins/ and make sure previous older versions of com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.package_##... are deleted (sometimes update fails to delete because of UAC).  Keep the current desired version and complete the following.


Run Eclipse as administrator or disable UAC temporarily. (windows 7)
Go to Help \xe2\x86\x92 Install New Software.
On Work with: type https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/ and press ENTER.
Wait for Eclipse to fetch the repository. An item named Developer tools will appear in the list.
Mark it for install, press Next and follow the steps to install the ADT tools.
When finished, it will ask to restart Eclipse. Make sure you do this.
When Eclipse restarts, all your Android SDK packages should show up again.  
Dont forget to resume UAC if you need it.
