Q:I am trying to implement swipe to delete the same as Gmail app "Swipe to archive":




I have tried many tutorials but none of them works as fast as gmail, 
I prefer to not work on external library. How can i do it?

Edit:

My code so far-

  ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback simpleItemTouchCallback = new ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback(0, ItemTouchHelper.LEFT | ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT) {
                public boolean onMove(RecyclerView recyclerView,
                                               RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, RecyclerView.ViewHolder target) {
//                    final int fromPos = viewHolder.getAdapterPosition();
//                    final int toPos = viewHolder.getAdapterPosition();
//                    // move item in `fromPos` to `toPos` in adapter.
                    return true;// true if moved, false otherwise
                }

            @Override
            public void onSwiped(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, int swipeDir) {
                //Remove swiped item from list and notify the RecyclerView
                mAdapter.notifyItemRemoved(viewHolder.getLayoutPosition());
            }
        };
        ItemTouchHelper itemTouchHelper = new ItemTouchHelper(simpleItemTouchCallback);
        itemTouchHelper.attachToRecyclerView(mRecyclerView);


I've managed to enable swipe gesture but i don't know how to add a background and an image under the viewHolder. I tried to put another FrameLayout at the item_XXX.xml file but on swipe it throws the whole item with the background.

A:I had to do this the other day and I had some issues so I decided to write a blog post on it. No 3rd party lib necessary.

Basically, you wouldn't draw the "undo state" via onChildDraw, it would be done via ViewHolder. Also you wouldn't actually delete row in onSwipe just mark it as "pending delete" and notify adapter to rebind it in "undo state". At the same time you post a Runnable actually removing the row in x seconds unless undo button is pressed...
