Q:I have a login screen with two EditTexts and a login button in my layout. The problem is that, when I start typing, the soft keyboard is shown and covers the login button. How can I push the layout up or above the keyboard when it appears?

I do not want to use a ScrollView, just want to implement it without scrolling down. Please, suggest me some way of doing it. Thanks in advance.

A:Set windowSoftInputMode property to adjustPan and adjustResize

<activity android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan|adjustResize"> </activity>
