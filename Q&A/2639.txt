Q:While I am trying to Install API 18 it shows only "Google API  18"(nothing more). Now if I try to install these google APIs from Android SDK Manager it shows a message "this package depends on "Missing SDK  platform Android, API 18". and Install button is disabled.

Does anybody here have Any idea how to install API 18(4.3_MR2 sdk) with eclipse

A:Have you installed SDK platform tool version 18? In your SDK Manager, there will be the latest version of SDK Platform tools that you have to install first then restart eclipse and then try for Android SDK API 18
