Q:I'm trying to figure out how to write an app that can decode audio morse code on the fly. I found this document which explains how to record audio from the microphone in Android. What I'd like to know is whether it's possible to access the raw input from the microphone or whether it has to be written/read to a file.

Thanks.

A:If you use MediaRecorder (the example, above) it will save compressed audio to a file.

If you use AudioRecord, you can get audio samples directly.

Yes, what you want to do should be possible.
