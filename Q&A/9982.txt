Q:I would like to be able to prevent a CheckBox from being selected (or to set it back to unselected), when the CheckBox is clicked

How can I achieve this?

I do not want to simply disable the checkbox. I want the user to think it is checkable, but when the user tries to check it... then I will (possibly) prevent the checkbox from being checked and display a message.

A:you can do something like this:

cb.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener(){

    @Override
    public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton buttonView,
    boolean isChecked) {
    if(isChecked){
        cb.setChecked(false);
        // Code to display your message.
        }
    }
});
