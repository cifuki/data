Q:How can I change the action bar search view hint text colour? 

This question explains how to get the EditText when using ABS:
Android ActionBar Customize Search View

Is there a android.R.id I could use to get a reference to the EditText so I could change the hint colour? Or is there some other way to change the colour?

A:android:actionBarWidgetTheme of your main theme should point to a style that has a android:textColorHint in it. That one will allow changing the hint text color of the search view.
