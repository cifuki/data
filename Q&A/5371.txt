Q:I recently heard about 9-patch images. I know its 9 tiled and is stretchable. I'd like to know more about it.


How can I create a 9-patch image?

Is there any tool? Can I create it from AndroidSDK or code?
Main Advantages of 9-patch over regular png?

(is it stretchable dynamically/ automatically according to screen?)

A:Today I discovered nine patch images. The official documentation (linked to in the other answers) is ok I suppose, but it really lacks in examples.

This little tutorial has some great examples at the end that answer the second part of your question, explaining how the scaling works - not just for buttons - but also frames, and it has a complete example project that you can download and play with. The most important advantage over PNG is that nine patch images can specify non-contiguous areas to scale.

To answer the first part of your question, the SDK (and now Android Studio) ships with "Draw 9-patch" ("draw9patch" in the SDK tools folder) which is a simple editor. Here is a nicer one which is also open source. It has a simple but clever default image.
