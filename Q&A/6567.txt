Q:I have a VideoView and I am streaming videos from a remote server. Most of the times It would play the videos very smoothly. But sometimes, it displays an error message "Sorry, This video cannot be played". I have a hunch that this is more on the supported video formats. However, I don't know which are the supported formats. My question is "How can I catch this error (e.g. Prevent the error message from appearing)"? I am using Android 2.2 on this project. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. :)

A:Try using setOnErrorListener: the documentation says If no listener is specified, or if the listener returned false, VideoView will inform the user of any errors., so I'm assuming if you set one and return true it will not show the user error.
