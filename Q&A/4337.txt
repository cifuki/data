Q:when i try to get the MD5 fingerprint using keytool, I get a SHA1 fingerprint instead and the google maps doesnt recognize it. How do I get the MD5 fingerprint?

A:Use JDK version 1.6 instead of 1.7 because 1.7 generates the fingerprint with SHA1 by default.
or you can use (-v) option of the keytool to give you all supported algorithms output and you will find the MD5 in it. for examble : keytool -v -list -keystore [your keystore path] and then enter the password which is [android] by default (you can get the keystore path from Eclipse window>Prefs>Android>build).
