Q:I have been trying to get the URI path for an asset file. 

uri = Uri.fromFile(new File("//assets/mydemo.txt"));


When I check if the file exists I see that file doesn't exist

File f = new File(filepath);
if (f.exists() == true) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Valid :" + filepath);
} else {
    Log.e(TAG, "InValid :" + filepath);
}


Can some one tell me how I can mention the absolute path for a file existing in the asset folder

A:There is no "absolute path for a file existing in the asset folder". The content of your project's assets/ folder are packaged in the APK file. Use an AssetManager object to get an InputStream on an asset.

For WebView, you can use the file Uri scheme in much the same way you would use a URL. The syntax for assets is file:///android_asset/... (note: three slashes) where the ellipsis is the path of the file from within the assets/ folder.
