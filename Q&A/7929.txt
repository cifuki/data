Q:I have a search widget in my Action Bar like this:



(1) How do I change the color of the text that says "iPhone"?

(2) Also, if you notice the gray X -- the entire Search Widget is that color as well when it is in an icon position.  I am on Holo.Theme.Light and utilizing my own mods to it.

How do I change these two styles for the widget in my styles.xml file (assuming that is where you make the changes for a search widget)?

A:You would have to set 

searchView.setBackgroundColor(Color.WHITE);


SearchViews are not so customizable.
