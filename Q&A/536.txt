Q:Is there a way to find and replace all occurrences of a word in an entire project( not just a single class using refactor -> rename) and also maintain case, either in android studio or using a command line script?

For example, Supplier has to go to Merchant, supplier -> merchant, SUPPLIER -> MERCHANT. My boss wants me to change all instances of supplier with merchant for a project im working on. Ive been doing it for about an hour and i know im wasting my time. Let me know of any time saving suggestions.

A:I think the shortcut that you're looking for is:

Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows and Linux/Ubuntu

Cmd+Shift+R on Mac OS X
