A:The drawableLeft (or any of the similar attributes) XML attribute can be modified (removing a drawable in your case) via code using something like this:

yourTextView.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(0, 0, 0, 0);
yourTextView.setText("The Text You Need In There");


The constructor for the method is in this order:

setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds (int left, int top, int right, int bottom)
