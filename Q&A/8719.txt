Q:I see the documentation says this method returns the position of the given item, but what would it return if no such item exists in the ArrayAdapter?

A:After looking through the source code I've found that the ArrayAdapter uses  List.indexOf(Object) to find the object and this method returns -1 when it doesn't exist.

GrepCode is awesome for finding stuff when the documentation is bad, I use it at least once a day :)
