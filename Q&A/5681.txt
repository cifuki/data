Q:Is it possible to catch the event that Soft Keyboard was shown or hidden for EditText?

A:Hi I'd used following workaround:

As far as my content view is a subclass of LinearLayout (could be any other view or view group), I'd overridden onMeasure method lilke following:

@Override
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
    final int proposedheight = MeasureSpec.getSize(heightMeasureSpec);
    final int actualHeight = getHeight();

    if (actualHeight > proposedheight){
        // Keyboard is shown
    } else {
        // Keyboard is hidden
    }

    super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
}


This workaround helped me to hide some controls when keyboard is showing and bring back otherwise.

Hope this would be useful.
