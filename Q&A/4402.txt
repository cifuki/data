Q:In Permissions tab of Android Manifest, in the drop down there are options called android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE. What is the difference between them? Is ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE more generalized than ACCESS_WIFI_STATE?

A:android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE is needed for accessing ConnectivityManager (mainly for monitoring network connections in general), while android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE grants access to WifiManager (for managing all aspects of Wi-Fi connectivity in particular).
