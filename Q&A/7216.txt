A:Wich API do you Refered in your project.

Because

android.annotation.SuppressLint - it's since Added in API level 16

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/annotation/SuppressLint.html

You need do next

You project rigth mouse click->Properties and check next picture for you select Project Build Target for API Level >=16
