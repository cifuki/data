Q:I need to make rate option in my android app.

A:The rating is done through market app so that ratings can be trusted. If apps were allowed to handle the rating themselves, then the developer could manipulate the app's rating any time. So there is no way you can handle the rating yourself. You can only prompt the user to your app page on Google Play and ask them to rate your app for more support.

Use the built-in intent to launch market

private void launchMarket() {
    Uri uri = Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + getPackageName());
    Intent myAppLinkToMarket = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);
    try {
        startActivity(myAppLinkToMarket);
    } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {
        Toast.makeText(this, " unable to find market app", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
}
