Q:I would like to test my application for cases of low network connectivity. Except standing in the elevator, what is the best way to do this? I've tried wrapping my phone in an aluminum foil, but it didn't help much.

I need to test it on a real device, not in an emulator.

A:You can use emulator for this. Take a look at this page: Android Emulator. Pay attention to next two arguments:


-netdelay <delay>


  Set network latency emulation to .    Default value is none. See
  the table in Network Delay Emulation for supported  values.

-netspeed <speed>  


  Set network speed emulation to .  Default value is full. See
  the table in Network Speed Emulation for supported  values.
