Q:I registered a receiver that listens to network events:

<receiver 
    android:label="NetworkConnection"
    android:name=".ConnectionChangeReceiver" >
    <intent-filter >
        <action android:name="android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>


receiver is also very simple:

public class ConnectionChangeReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = (ConnectivityManager) context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);
        NetworkInfo activeNetInfo = connectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfo();
        if (activeNetInfo != null) {
                Log.v("@@@","Receiver : " + activeNetInfo);
        } else {
            Log.v("@@@","Receiver : " + "No network");
        }
    }
}


The problem is, when Wifi is connected I receive 3 identical messages in a row, like this:

Receiver : NetworkInfo: type: WIFI[], state: CONNECTED/CONNECTED, reason: (unspecified), extra: (none), roaming: false, failover: false, isAvailable: true
Receiver : NetworkInfo: type: WIFI[], state: CONNECTED/CONNECTED, reason: (unspecified), extra: (none), roaming: false, failover: false, isAvailable: true
Receiver : NetworkInfo: type: WIFI[], state: CONNECTED/CONNECTED, reason: (unspecified), extra: (none), roaming: false, failover: false, isAvailable: true


They are all "CONNECTED/CONNECTED" (Shouldn't they be something like CONNECTING/OBTAINING_IPADDR, etc.), so the problem is how do I tell when It's really connected? I have some routines that I want to make when wifi is actually connected, and I dont want them to be called three times in a row. 

PS: 3G sends only one message, so no problem here.

Update: 

Seems like it's device specific problem.

For test I took 2 Desire HD, and 4 random android phones(different Aquos models and some no-name chinese stuff). On both DHD and one random phone on wifi connect I got 3 messages, on remaining phones I got only one message. WTF.

A:Receiving multiple broadcast is a device specific problem. Some phones just send one broadcast while other send 2 or 3. But there is a work around:

Assuming you get the disconnect message when the wifi is disconnected, I would guess the first one is the correct one and the other 2 are just echoes for some reason.

To know that the message has been called, you could have a static boolean that gets toggled between connect and disconnect and only call your sub-routines when you receive a connection and the boolean is true.  Something like:

public class ConnectionChangeReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    private static boolean firstConnect = true;

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        final ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = (ConnectivityManager) context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);
        final NetworkInfo activeNetInfo = connectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfo();
        if (activeNetInfo != null) {
            if(firstConnect) { 
                // do subroutines here
                firstConnect = false;
            }
        }
        else {
            firstConnect= true;
        }
    }
}
