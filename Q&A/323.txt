Q:I have an application that uses the Google Maps Android v2 API. I've added the google-play-services_lib library project to my workspace and added a reference to it from my application project, following the instructions on these pages:


http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start


Everything seems to work fine: The app displays maps and overlays with the default markers.  So I'm pretty sure I've got the Google Play services and Google Maps API stuff set up correctly.

However, I see this message in the ADT LogCat window whenever the map view is initialized (on a 2nd-gen Nexus 7):

The Google Play services resources were not found. Check your project configuration to ensure that the resources are included.


The message level is Error, and the tag is GooglePlayServicesUtil.

This seems benign, as my app does work fine. But what can I do or check to try to address whatever the problem might be?



Further info: Each time the "Google Play services resources were not found" message appears in LogCat, it is preceded by these messages, which are Warnings and tagged ResourceType:

getEntry failing because entryIndex 906 is beyond type entryCount 3

Failure getting entry for 0x7f0b038a (t=10 e=906) in package 0 (error -2147483647)


FWIW, I can't find the constant 0x7f0b038a anywhere when I search the projects, including the gen/R.java files.

I've checked the contents of the generated .apk, and it includes all of the resources that are in the google-play-services_lib/res directory.



Another update: After adding ActionBarSherlock and updating the targetSdkVersion in my manifest from 8 to 17, I now see another error in the LogCat output:

Could not find class 'maps.af.k', referenced from method 'maps.ag.an.a'


More details about that problem can be found here: Google Maps works fine on Android but I still get an error "Could not find class 'maps.i.k', referenced from method maps.z.ag.a"

And once again, the app seems to work just fine. Maybe it's safe to ignore these "errors"?

A:This is a bug in the Google Play services library, and it is filed here under issue 755.

Unfortunately, there isn't any solution yet.
