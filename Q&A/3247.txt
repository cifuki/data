Q:Does anyone know if there is a google goggles API for Android? If not, is there one coming any time soon? With an API for this thing the possibilities are endless...

So far all I've been able to find on this subject is a discussion about not currently having a version for the iPhone due to it's "google labs" status (iPhone version coming once it's more "complete"). I'm hoping an API may be released then. Anybody have any info on this at all?
