Q:I have my application that is displaying images with different ratio, resized inside (centerInside) imageView. What I need is to create bitmap from the ImageView including the background (black in this case). 

So for example I have device screen 320x480, full screen imageView with image resized to 280x480. How could I get 320x480 bitmap from it? 

On top of this imageview I have some logos or buttons that I don't want to include to bitmap, they're like on top layer. All I need is bitmap with image and black border from some sides.

A:Have you tried:

BitmapDrawable drawable = (BitmapDrawable) imageView.getDrawable();
Bitmap bitmap = drawable.getBitmap();
