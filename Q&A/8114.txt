Q:I'm working on an application that displays someone else's database of images.  The images they have are all vector graphics and can be converted to any format, however keeping them in a vector format is good because users will probably want to zoom in closely.

The question is, is there a built-in way to display a vector graphic in Android?  The format doesn't matter - we can convert.  The current format we're considering is PDF, but given that there's no native PDF support, I'd have to do something pretty complex just to get it working (for example, integrating poppler into my app via the NDK).  The alternative is to just convert the vector graphics into a simpler format (JPG, GIF) but I'd rather avoid that.

A:Check out svg-android - it's a relatively new library and it only supports SVG Basic, but it's the library used to draw Androidify. There are examples on the homepage on how to get a Drawable from an SVG which sems to be what you're looking for.
