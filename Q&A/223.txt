A:The current configuration, as used to determine which resources to retrieve, is available from the Resources' Configuration object:

getResources().getConfiguration().orientation;


You can check for orientation by looking at its value:

int orientation = getResources().getConfiguration().orientation;
if (orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
    // In landscape
} else {
    // In portrait
}
