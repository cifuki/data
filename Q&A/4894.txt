Q:I have an app that prints a calculated money value and I want to display that value with the default currency format. 

For example in Europe you would write: 

1.000,95\xe2\x82\xac

In the US I think you would write 

1,000.95$

In other currencies there are more or less values displayed for the decimal fraction, in US it would be 2 but in Japan it would be 0. 

How can I obtain a exact as possible format for all existing currencies?

A:I found the solution. THe class NumberFormat has a multitude of predefined formatters. There is also one for formatting currency Values. 

If you use the static method getCurrencyInstance the class will return a formatter for the device default currency. I use the following code to set my result: 

NumberFormat format = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
((TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_result)).setText(format.format(result));
