Q:I am using Android Studio/IntelliJ to build on an existing Android project and would like to add some simple JUnit unit tests. What is the right folder to add such tests on?

The android Gradle plug-in defines a directory structure with src/main/java for the main source code and src/instrumentTest/java for Android tests. 

Trying to add my JUnit tests in instrumentTest didn't work for me. I can run it as an Android test (that's what that directory seems for) but that's not what I'm looking for - I just want to run a simple JUnit test.
I tried creating a JUnit run configuration for this Class but that also didn't work - I'm supposing because I'm using a directory that is flagged as Android Test instead of Source.

If I create a new source folder and marki it as such in Project Structure, this will get wiped next time IntelliJ refreshes the project configuration from the gradle build files.

What is the more appropriate way of configuring JUnit tests in an gradle-based android project on IntelliJ? Which directory structure to use for this?
