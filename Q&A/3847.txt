Q:I need to modify an existing APK, modify the sources and then recompile it.


I can decompile it using dex2jar or apktool, it's working great 
From the jar file I can obtain the java sources (using jd-gui)
Then I can modify the java files


But now I would like to know how to recompile the java files and put them back into a jar file! (the jar part should be easy, the main problem seems to be how to recompile the java files for android)

I know that an other solution is to use apktool and then modify the smali files, but it seems to be really complicated when we want to add a lot of code!

My application is a basic a HelloWorld whitout obfuscation.

A:Thanks to  Chris Jester-Young I managed to make it work!

I think the way I managed to do it will work only on really simple projects:


With Dex2jar I obtained the Jar.
With jd-gui I convert my Jar back to Java files.
With apktool i got the android manifest and the ressources files
In Eclipse I create a new project with the same settings as the old one (checking all the information in the manifest file)
When the project is created I'm replacing all the ressources and the manifest with the ones I obtained with apktool
I paste the java files I extracted from the Jar in the src foled (respecting the packages)
I modify those files with what I need
Everything is compiling! 


/!\\ be sure you removed the old apk from the device an error will be thrown stating that the apk signature is not the same as the old one!
