How can we solve this?

A:You can add the following line inside your default config of your app build.gradle:

defaultConfig{
   vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true
}


Edit: you also need to add this dependency if you didn't already

dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.1.1'
}


Update: 

Since Gradle 3.4 the compile configuration is deprecated and should be replaced by implementation:

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.1.1'
}
