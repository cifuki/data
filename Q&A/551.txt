A:I am not sure the API provides directly an API, if you consider this thread:


  I was wondering the same thing.
  In my case I have a BroadcastReceiver implementation that calls
  Context#unregisterReceiver(BroadcastReceiver) passing itself as the argument after handling the Intent that it receives.
  There is a small chance that the receiver's onReceive(Context, Intent) method is called
  more than once, since it is registered with multiple IntentFilters, creating the potential for an IllegalArgumentException being thrown from Context#unregisterReceiver(BroadcastReceiver).
  
  In my case, I can store a private synchronized member to check before calling Context#unregisterReceiver(BroadcastReceiver), but it would be
  much cleaner if the API provided a check method.
