Q:I'm experiencing a really unusual behavior:

From today (no style, Gradle or layout changes done), every-time I click on an EditText or TextInputEditText (just set focus on them), the app crashes with the following error:


  java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.ref.SoftReference cannot be
  cast to android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection
                                                                                               at
  com.android.tools.profiler.support.profilers.EventProfiler$InputConnectionHandler.run(EventProfiler.java:330)
                                                                                               at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:833)


I searched on the net and I didn't find anything similar and at the moment I'm really without any idea.

I tried it on two different Huawei devices with Android 6.0 and both result in a crash.

If I run it on my phone (Oneplus 3, Android 7) I have no errors and the app works correctly.

What I tried:


Changing the layout, one of those who were crashing
Adding a simple EditText with no attributes set
Removing all code and leaving the Activity "blank"
Cleaning some gradle unused references
Uninstalling app from phone
Rebooting phone
Invalidating


Not a single solution worked. What is happening to my application?

Thanks all
