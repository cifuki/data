Q:I am using ant-release to do a 1-step build of my Android app.

My build.properties looks like this:

application.package=xxxxx
key.store=sonr
key.alias=sonr labs
key.store.password=xxxx
key.alias.password=xxxx


When I run ant-release everything is fine except for application signing. I get the error:

-release-prompt-for-password:

-release-nosign:
     [echo] No key.store and key.alias properties found in build.properties.
     [echo] Please sign /Users/syalam/Documents/git/joeborn-sonr/sonr/bin/SONR-release-unsigned.apk manually
     [echo] and run zipalign from the Android SDK tools.

How can I resolve this?

PS. I followed this tutorial for getting my build process down http://www.androidengineer.com/2010/06/using-ant-to-automate-building-android.html

A:I had this problem too recently, I think that that tutorial is out of date...

The key.alias etc directives need to be in a file named ant.properties. There's no file called build.properties any more.
