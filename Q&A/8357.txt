Q:I'm writing my first app, and I have a question about DatePicker.

My app requires the user to input a date. The most user-friendly way would be to popup a calendar-like widget that displays the current month like a calendar grid - something like this:



I want to use that in place of the DatePicker interface - which has Month, Day, and Year fields, each with an up and down button to increment/decrement.

Is this type of functionality built into any Android widget or view, or would I have to design my own custom component to do this? I figured this would already exist, seeing how much this type of UI is used so frequently in non-mobile apps and web pages.

Thanks!

There is no component for that in the Android SDK, sorry. The widget you illustrate is too small for a touchscreen. You can implement something larger (see the Calendar app), but you are largely on your own for that.
