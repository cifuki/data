Q:I just started using Android Studio 1.3 sdk 24 and it has worked fine until today. I get this error message about cache.properties and I delete that cache file but now I am getting this error message:          


  Error:C:\\Users\\user1.gradle\\caches\\2.4\\scripts\\asLocalRepo15_dhjxrnvsgiyg1ow3dfj4myl7\\InitScript\\initscript\\cache.properties (The system cannot find the file specified)       


I try file/invalidate caches/restart.. and rebuild project but am still getting this error message. How do I fix it?

A:You don't have to delete all .gradle folders and no need to reinstall Android Studio.

I have the latest version of Android Studio and I faced that problem, the only thing that worked for me is to:


Navigate to C:\\Users\\user\\.gradle\\caches\\2.x\\
Copy the folder scripts , scripts-remapped and paste it somewhere safe just in case anything went wrong you will place it back
Delete this folder scripts and scripts-remapped  from the directory C:\\Users\\user\\.gradle\\caches\\2.x\\
Sync Project with Gradle Files and you are done.




When you sync your project Android Studio will generate new cache files.

You also need to delete buildOutputCleanup.lock from projectLocation/.gradle/buildOutputCleanup in case the above 4 steps do not work out.

It worked for me I hope it will work for you.
