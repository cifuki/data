Q:I got this error: ERROR/MapActivity(258): Couldn't get connection factory client

Everything worked fine, it's all of a sudden, how come that happens?
I know my api key is fine, because one month I've been using it perfectly.
How come all of a sudden it doesn't show me the map activity, and posts that error in the logcat?

A:I'm getting the same problem when using getFromLocationName, with a 'java.io.IOException:Service not Available' error.

I've done a bit of googling around and it seems this is a bug in the software.
