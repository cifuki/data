Q:I'm pretty close to finished with my first game for Android, and I've come across a problem that's so simple I'm sure I'll feel stupid for not knowing how to solve it, but how can I force the app to stay in a Horizontal layout?  Right now, if you turn the phone (emulator) it flips the graphics and squeezes them.  I want the game to start horizontally and stay that way regardless of how the user turns the phone.

Thank you.

A:Open the AndroidManifest.xml and add the following android:screenOrientation="landscape"
e.g.

 <activity android:name=".ActivtyName" 
       android:screenOrientation="landscape"
                >
