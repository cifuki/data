Q:Probably a very basic question, but what is the difference between setting a ListViews choice mode between CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE and CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL? The Android documentation doesn't really explain much..

From Android Dev site:


CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE: The list allows multiple choices
CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL: The list allows multiple choices in a modal selection mode

A:If I'm not mistaken, CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL was added in the later APIs (11?) and is primarily used to indicate multiple selections using a Contextual ActionBar (CAB).
