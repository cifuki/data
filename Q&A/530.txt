Q:I need to know which elements are currently displayed in my RecyclerView. There is no equivalent to the OnScrollListener.onScroll(...) method on ListViews. I tried to work with View.getGlobalVisibleRect(...), but that hack is too ugly and does not always work too.

Someone any ideas?

A:First / last visible child depends on the LayoutManager.
If you are using LinearLayoutManager or GridLayoutManager, you can use 

int findFirstVisibleItemPosition();
int findFirstCompletelyVisibleItemPosition();
int findLastVisibleItemPosition();
int findLastCompletelyVisibleItemPosition();


For example:

GridLayoutManager layoutManager = ((GridLayoutManager)mRecyclerView.getLayoutManager());
int firstVisiblePosition = layoutManager.findFirstVisibleItemPosition();


For LinearLayoutManager, first/last depends on the adapter ordering. Don't query children from RecyclerView; LayoutManager may prefer to layout more items than visible for caching.
