Q:Ok so I am an avid user of Emacs and tend to stay away from using IDE's unless I absolutely have to and I see that it is recommended to use Eclipse with a plugin for developing android. I was just wondering if it is really necessary to use the Eclipse plugin (or some others out there)?

A:You can absolutely use Emacs: http://riddell.us/AndroidWithEmacsOnUbuntu.html. (This site has disappeared but a copy was captured by the Wayback Machine which can be found here http://web.archive.org/web/20120321225744/http://riddell.us/AndroidWithEmacsOnUbuntu.html) It describes how to use Emacs and only Emacs for a test application.
No Eclipse.
