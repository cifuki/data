Q:I just published my first application on Google Play and I accidentally chose the wrong language as default language for my application. I set "German", though my app is actually in English.

I can't find the settings anywhere where I could possibly change this setting.

Does anyone know where to edit this?

A:click "add translation", select US English.

This shows another button "manage translations", and you can change the default language, or delete other translations.
