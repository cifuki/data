Q:Which you think is the best way of doing a wizard like application (user can navigate between screens with a next and back button, and each screen has to save some state data) in Android platform.

I mainly can think in two approaches:


Having one activity+view for each screen and then i make the screen switch by calling each activity. What make this nice is that i can use the system back button as my back handler and i don't have to take care of that myself, aslo each activity will save it's own state.
Having one activity and many views, and what i switch views in each screen change, this helps me re-use more code, but makes saving states a mess.


What do you think? Which is the best way of doing this on Android?

A:I suggest going with 2 as it fits the goal of activities and views.  Saving state in this case is easy - if you use the MVC pattern, you can simply have a model object that is passed along to the views.  Each view will have portions of the model that it can read/write.  No matter where you are, the model should always have the current state.  If you get disposed, just save the model.  Restore works automatically since you already read from the model when you show each page.
