Q:In Android, you can specify the texts in the default locale in res/values/strings.xml. Additional translations can be added for new languages in res/values-it/strings.xml (for Italian for example). If a string is not translated, the fallback-default locale is used.

Currently I can not tell which strings I still need to translate (so are in values/strings.xml, but not in values-$/strings.xml for all $ in languages) and which are translated, although the are obsolte (so are in values-$/strings.xml, but not in values/strings.xml exists $ in languages)

I'm searching for a tool which gives me the translations which are missing and the one which are obsolete. 

To be honest, it is not that difficult to write such a tool for the command-line, I can only hardly believe nobody has already done this.

A:Interesting question. I've wrote simple script to find duplicate resources in android project at https://gist.github.com/1133059. It is ugly, I know, but I'll rewrite it in a few days and maybe create a project on github. 
To run it from console:
$scala DuplicatesFinder.scala /path/to/android/project

UPDATE:
I've made a project on github https://github.com/4e6/android-localization-helper, maybe someone find it helpful
