Q:I have an Activity A which calls Activity B. In Activity B, when i click on a button, finish() is called, which in turn calls onDestroy() of Activity B and returns to activity A. 

According to android documentation, Before onDestroy is called, onSaveInstanceState(Bundle bundle) will be called, where i do the following. 

@Override
    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {

        super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
        System.out.println("Saving webview state");
        Log.d(TAG, "In onsave");
        wv.saveState(outState);

    }


and the next time Activity B is started from Activity A, 

in the oncreate(), i do the following:

onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

if(savedInstanceState != null){
//restore webview
}else {
// code
}
}


However, before calling onDestroy in Activity B, The onSaveInstanceState method is never called. 
any help on this will be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: if this is not possible. Please let me know if there is a way to store webview state

A:Please notice that onRestoreInstanceState() is called when activity is recreated but only if:

it was killed by the OS. "Such situation happen when:   


orientation of the device changes (your activity is destroyed and recreated)
there is another activity in front of yours and at some point the OS kills your activity in order to free memory (for example). Next time when you start your activity onRestoreInstanceState() will be called."


So if you are in your activity and you hit Back button on the device, your activity is finish()ed and next time you start your app it is started again (it sounds like re-created, isn't it?) but this time without saved state because you intentionally exited it when you hit Back button.
