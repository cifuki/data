Q:I updated my android studio to latest version that is android studio1.4.

By default in a new project, there is a file content_main.xml in layout folder.
What is the use of this file?

A:According to new design pattern in android studio activity_main.xml will determine how the global UI of the Activity should be. And on the other hand content_main.xml will determine the contents in the activity_main.xml.

That is content_main.xml will contain the textview, edittext, button etc component. And it will be included by the activity_main.xml.

So we can think of content_main.xml just like partial in HTML. activity_main.xml will contain your activity global design, and content_main.xml will contain the contents.

From view of what they contain:

activity_main : Co-ordinator layout, ViewPager etc

content_main : Developer choosen elements. textview, edittext, button etc. 

What the android developer website says about them is 


  activity_main:
  
  This XML layout file is for the activity you added when you created
  the project with Android Studio. Following the New Project workflow,
  Android Studio presents this file with both a text view and a preview
  of the screen UI. The file contains some default interface elements
  from the material design library, including the app bar and a floating
  action button. It also includes a separate layout file with the main
  content
  
  content_main:
  
  This XML layout file resides in activity_my.xml (activity_main) ,
  and contains some settings and Textview(other) element.
