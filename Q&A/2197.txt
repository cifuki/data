Q:I'm wondering if anyone knows how to open two windows of Android Studio with both having the same project. I know you can drag tabs out, but that allows you to only edit that one file. I want two fully-featured windows with each being able to see the Project Files/Structure.

I don't want to just split the editor, I want a separate window.

I want two of these windows, with both "looking" at the same project:


I don't want another one of these windows, as I can't view the project structure and change that, and it's hard to change it to a different file in this view:

A:Right click on tab of the file and click "Split vertical / Horizontal"



After splitting, you can just drag one of the tab titles to the second monitor - it will open up a new window. You can then edit the same file in two separate windows
