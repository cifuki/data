Q:I'm trying to port Jnetpcap to Android in order to use it for parsing .pcap files. Jnetpcap is a java wrapper for libpcap which uses JNI. I have compiled libpcap as a static library using the android's source code tree.

When compiling Jnetpcap as a shared library I'm getting errors because I have to link with libpcap.a but I don't know how could I tell Android.mk that he must link with the libpcap.a file that I have.

Using "LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES:= libpcap" won't work because libpcap doesn't come by default in the android NDK.

If any of you guys could help me I would be very thankful.

Here is my current Android.mk file:

include /home/sergio/workspace/MyApp/jni/libpcap/Android.mk

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_MODULE := jnetpcap

LOCAL_SRC_FILES :=\\
    jnetpcap.cpp\\
    packet_flow.cpp\\
    packet_jheader.cpp\\
    jnetpcap_pcap_header.cpp\\

LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := /home/sergio/android-ndk-r5b/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/usr/include /home/sergio/workspace/Shark/jni/libpcap

LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := libpcap

include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)

A:You have to build pcap as static module. Something like this

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := pcap
LOCAL_CFLAGS := declare_flags
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := declare_include
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := src_files
include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)


This build pcap as local module which you could link with LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES

just add 

LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := pcap


before calling 

include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
