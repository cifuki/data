Q:I have a TimePickerDialog  with is24Hour set to false since I want to present the end-user with the more familiar 12 hour format. When the hour, minute and AM PM indicator are set and the time is returned how can I identify whether the end-user has selected AM or PM?

This is what I have for the listener:

private TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener mTimeSetListener =
      new TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener() {

    @Override
    public void onTimeSet(TimePicker view, int hourOfDay, 
      int minute) {
     mHour = hourOfDay;
     mMinute = minute;
    // mIsAM = WHERE CAN I GET THIS VALUE
    }
};

A:The hourOfDay will always be 24-hour. If you opened the dialog with is24HourView set to false, the user will not have to deal with 24-hour formatted times, but Android will convert that to a 24-hour time when it calls onTimeSet().
