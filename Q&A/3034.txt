Q:It seems like every step I take in the Android world I run into problems.

Usually, I have my HTC Hero connected to the computer via USB and I launch the application either in debug mode or in normal mode.

So, the last time I ran the app in normal mode. Then I disconnect the device (I want to try to have it "free", not connected to computer) and I start the app from the menu. When I do that I get a popup saying "Application xxx is waiting for the debugger to attach" and there it stops and eventually dies.

Why is it waiting for the debugger, when the last time I ran the app (while connected) I didn't run it as Debug?

Edit 1

I might add this little weird fact:

If I do "Run" (green/white arrow) when the device is connected I still get a popup on the device saying "Application xxx is waiting for the debugger to attach".

Edit 2

Found this page. He restarted his device and that worked for me too. Stupid not to try that right away...

A:Just to close this question: I restarted the device, and that helped.
