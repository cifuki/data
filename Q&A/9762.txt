Q:I have a fairly complex android app, the contents of the 'layout' folder is becoming increasingly large. I've tried to organise the individual layout xml files into sub folders e.g. layout/buttons/, layout/activity/, layout/views/ etc. This doesn't seem to work, the content of the folders in not parsed into the R. class. 

Is there a way to do this?

Thanks!

A:I don't think you're going to be able to do this. I believe that it only supports certain folder names like layout-large, 
layout-mdpi, layout-hdpi, layout-fr, etc. You can use more than one of these modifies as well like layout-fr-hdpi-large.

This page shows all of the allowed modifiers
