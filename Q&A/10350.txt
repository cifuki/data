Q:Is there a way to adjust the spacing between characters in an Android TextView?  I believe this is typically called "kerning".

I'm aware of the android:textScaleX attribute, but that compresses the characters along with the spacing.

A:AFAIK, you cannot adjust kerning in TextView. You may be able to adjust kerning if you draw the text on the Canvas yourself using the 2D graphics APIs.
