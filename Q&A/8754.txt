Q:I'm working on an Android application that has several Activities. In it I have a class with several static methods. I would like to be able to call these methods from the different Activities. I'm using the static methods to load data from an xml file via a XmlResourceParser. To create a XmlResourceParser requires a call on the Application Context. So my question is, what is the best way to get a reference to the Application Context into the static methods? Have each Activity get it and pass it in? Store it somehow in a global variable?

A:The better way would be to pass the Activity object as parameter to the static functions.

AFAIK, there is no such method which will give you the application context in the static method.
