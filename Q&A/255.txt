Q:I just noticed the fact that the method addPreferencesFromResource(int preferencesResId) is marked deprecated in Android's documentation (Reference Entry). 

Unfortunately, no alternative method is provided in the method's description. 

Which method should be used instead in order to connect a preferenceScreen.xml to the matching PreferenceActivity?

A:No alternative method is provided in the method's description because the preferred approach (as of API level 11) is to instantiate PreferenceFragment objects to load your preferences from a resource file. See the sample code here: PreferenceActivity
