Q:I am using onConfigurationChanged(). In that, when I am changing from LandScape to Portrait, it is calling if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) and shifting to Portrait from LandScape. But when I am changing from Portrait to Land-Scape, it is not changing to LandScape because it is calling if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) so, it is not changing from LandScape to Portrait.
Please help.

public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
        super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);

        //int orientation = this.getResources().getConfiguration().orientation;

        if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {
            Log.d("Entered to change as Portrait ","PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP");
            setContentView(R.layout.settings);
        } else if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
            Log.d("Entered to change as LandScape ","LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL");
            setContentView(R.layout.settings);
        }

    }

A:Just write the below code into onConfigurationChanged method and test 

if(newConfig.orientation==Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE){

    Log.e("On Config Change","LANDSCAPE");
}else{

    Log.e("On Config Change","PORTRAIT");
}


and write the android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation" into your manifiest file like this

<activity android:name="TestActivity"
           android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation">


it's working at my side, i hope it helps you.

If you're on tablet also add |screenSize to android:configChanges
