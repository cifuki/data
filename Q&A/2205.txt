A:I've found the answer.


Move .android folder to E:\\Android\\
Create environment variable called
ANDROID_SDK_HOME and set its value to
E:\\Android


Setting environment variable in Windows XP or Windows 7:


Right-click on My Computer and choose "Properties")
Click the "Advanced" tab
Click the button "Environment Variables".
Add New variable
