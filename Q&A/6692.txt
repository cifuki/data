Q:I need to get the Android device timestamp in the format hh:mm:ss:SS. I am able to view the time displayed in the Logcat of Eclipse. Is it the computer's time or is it the Android device's time?

A:If you are running your app on Android device then it will print device's time, if on emulator then it will show computer's time.

To be ensure just match the Log's time with device's time and with computer's time you will find your answer..
