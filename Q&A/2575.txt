Q:After googling quite a bit I am unable to find the answer to this question. Is google play store officially support in avd emulators. 

I know it was once stopped , then I hear that it was brought back after specific version of android. I am using avd android version 4.4.3 (api 19) google app . I dont see a google play store app there. Am I suppose to expect it? Or is there an official apk for google play store that can be installed on the avd officially?
