Q:I read a lot on how to save my instance state or how to deal with my activity getting destroyed during screen rotation. 

There seem to be a lot of possibilities but I haven't figured out which one works best for retrieving results of an AsyncTask.

I have some AsyncTasks that are simply started again and call the isFinishing() method of the activity and if the activity is finishing they wont update anything.  

The problem is that I have one Task that does a request to a web service that can fail or succeed and restarting the task would result in a financial loss for the user. 

How would you solve this? What are the advantages or disadvantages of the possible solutions?

A:My first suggestion would be to make sure you actually need your activity to be reset on a screen rotation (the default behavior). Every time I've had issues with rotation I've added this attribute to my <activity> tag in the AndroidManifest.xml, and been just fine.

android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"


It looks weird, but what it does it hand off to your onConfigurationChanged() method, if you don't supply one it just does nothing other than re-measure the layout, which seems to be  a perfectly adequate way of handling the rotate most of the time.
