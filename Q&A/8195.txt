Q:I am trying to create a viewpager that swipes through 3 different fragments each with a different toolbar. I have implemented the new toolbar in an activity before and got it to work however I am trying to get it to work with fragments

Here is the fragment code

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // Inflate the layout resource that'll be returned
    View rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_home, container, false);


    mToolbar = (Toolbar) rootView.findViewById(R.id.toolbar_home);
    if (mToolbar != null) {
        setSupportActionBar(mToolbar);
    }
    mToolbar.setTitle(null);

    return rootView;
}


I am extending my fragment with Fragment, however I am getting the error

Cannot resolve method setSupportActionBar


I am not sure how to resolve this, if I remove the setSupportActionBar code will it stop working with certain devices?

A:Fragments don't have such method setSupportActionBar(). ActionBar is a property of Activity, so to set your toolbar as the actionBar, your activity should extend from ActionBarActivity and then you can call in your Fragment:

 ((ActionBarActivity)getActivity()).setSupportActionBar(mToolbar);


UPDATE

If you're using AppCompatActivity :

 ((AppCompatActivity)getActivity()).setSupportActionBar(mToolbar);
