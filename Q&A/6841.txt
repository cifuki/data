Q:This is just out of curiosity.  

Is there any way we can make an FM Radio App for Android devices?
I know this is possible, as most of the android devices these days come with an built-in Radio App.  

But how can I make such an App?

Where is the FM Radio Api?

A:There is no official API for FM radio in Android, however enthusiasts found the way to enable radio on Nexus One

Devices that I worked with have proprietary vendor-specific API to work with FM radio. Reverse engineering has to be used to figure out API signatures which may (and most likely will) be prohibited by the licence agreement of the device's firmware.
