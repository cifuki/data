Q:I need to implement push notification feature in my application. Exploring some options.

Google recently recommends Firebase platform, but this is not completely a free service. So I thought of using GCM again. Will google stop support for GCM in future?

A:Firebase Cloud Messaging is free of charge, just like Google Cloud Messaging was. The Firebase pricing page shows exactly what Firebase features are paid.
