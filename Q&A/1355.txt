Q:In the Eclipse IDE there is a great feature allows you to add (implement) all of the required methods of the particular class. I'm looking for this feature in the Android Studio IDE, but without success so far. Is there something similar? For me it is one of the key-features and can't live without.

edit:

I don't want to choose methods to implemet. I want IDE to do it for me like Eclipse were doing. For example when I clicked "Add unimplemented methods" inside any Activity extented class all of these onCreate() onPause() onResume() were generated.

A:Of course there is. It is called Implement methods or Override Methods. The default shortcut is CTRL-I and CTRL-O. See descrption of Implementing Methods and Overriding Methods.
