Q:How to save Object while orientation change, since onRetainNonConfigurationInstance and getLastNonConfigurationInstance are deprecated. And which cannot me used with compatibility package android-support-v4.jar FragmentActivity, where it shows Cannot override the final method from FragmentActivity

developer site say   


  Use the new Fragment API setRetainInstance(boolean) instead;


But I don't know how to save a custom object using setRetainInstance  

My scenario :
In my activity I have a AsyncTask with progress dialog. Here I need to handle orientation change.
For that I got a very good answer from Mark Murphy, CommonsWare
background-task-progress-dialog-orientation-change-is-there-any-100-working,
with sample project 

Since I'm using compatibility package android-support-v4.jar, FragmentActivity, I can't override onRetainNonConfigurationInstance
Cannot override the final method from FragmentActivity

Is there any alternative method for saving my custom object?

EDIT:
I cannot make my AsyncTask task Parcelable (If I'm not wrong) since it use interface, context etc.
My AsyncTask 

 public class CommonAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Object, Object, Object>  {
        Context context;
        AsyncTaskServices callerObject;
        ProgressDialog progressDialog;
        String dialogMessag ; 
    ................


I'm looking, is there any alternatives for onRetainNonConfigurationInstance method, which save an object completely while orientation change and later can be retrieve using getLastNonConfigurationInstance

A:There are two alternatives:


Use a Loader. The FragmentActivity will take care of saving/restoring its state when re-creating.
Use a fragment without a view and call setRetainInstance(true) on it. There is an example of this in the compatibility library's source, FragmentRetainInstanceSupport or some such.
