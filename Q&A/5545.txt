Q:I'm quite new to the Android world, and, due to work needs, I'm trying to get in.
Whilst I'm not particularly afraid of the "thinking" code (i.e. Java), I'm a bit confused when developing the user interface.

Since I found that the simplest yet most effective way to learn something is copying from those who are the best, I'm wondering if there's some resource or something, out there, well done.

I mean: do you know some open source app, from which I can build my own knowledge about Android layouts? I wasn't able to do it on my own, even though I wondered quite a lot!
