Q:we have android + linux m/c, we log in into linux shell and boot the machine in android GUI.
now we have the some script that is running on the same machine through linux shell. In that case when the script hangs we need to restart android machine. but it result into restarting the linux machine too. as they are on same machine. so i need the way to restart the android so it comes out of hang state and control remains on the script that is running through the linux shell.

so is there any adb or linux command that work for me?

A:You can reboot the device by sending the following broadcast:

$ adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED
