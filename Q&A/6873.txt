Q:android-studio 0.2.7
Fedora 18


Hello,

I am trying to add the jtwitter jar to my project.

First I tried doing the following:

1) Drag the jtwitter.jar into the root directory of my project explorer, see picture
2) File | project structure
3) Modules | yamba-yamba | dependencies
4) Click the plus sign | jars or directories | and navigate to jtwitter jar | click ok




When I import the jar file I get the following error:

import winterwell.jtwitter.Twitter;

Cannot resolve symbol winterwell
Gradle: error: package winterwell.jtwitter does not exist


I researched and found that android-studio has some issues and that you have to edit the build.gradle file yourself.

So I tried adding this to my build.gradle file:

dependencies {
    compile files('libs/jtwitter.jar')




And got an error message: cannot resolve symbol dependencies

Another question, where would the libs folder be. Does it mean the External Libraries?

Any help will be most helpfull,

A:Updated answer for Android Studio 2

The easy and correct way to import a jar/aar into your project is to import it as a module.

New -> Module



Select Import .JAR/.AAR Package



Select the .JAR/.AAR file and put a module name



Add the module as a dependency
