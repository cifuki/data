Q:I'm having trouble importing some of the Android UI testing framework clases - I just can't figure out what is going wrong!

This is my class:

@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
@LargeTest
public class ExampleUnitTest {

@Rule
public ActivityTestRule<MainActivity> mActivityRule = new ActivityTestRule(MainActivity.class);

@Test
public void listGoesOverTheFold() {
    onView(withText("Hello world!")).check(matches(isDisplayed()));
  }
}


But for some reason I get errors 'cannot find symbol ActivityTestRule' and 'cannot find symbol AndroidJUnit4'. I've tried to import them but they cannot be found.

The dependencies in build.gradle are set to:

compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.4.0'
androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:23.4.0'

androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:runner:0.4'
androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:rules:0.4'
androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.1'
androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.uiautomator:uiautomator-v18:2.1.2'


So I think I have all the dependencies setup - I've been trying many things but with no luck.

Anyone have any ideas?

A:There are two different types of tests you can set up in Android

Unit Tests  


These run directly on the JVM and do not have access to the Android framework classes.
They are kept in the test/java package
Dependencies need to added in the build.gradle file with the command testCompile
You generally use Mockito, Robolectric & JUnit for these tests


Instrumentation Tests


These run on an Android emulator and have full access to all the Android classes
They are kept in the androidTest/java package
Dependencies need to be added to build.gradle with androidTestCompile
You generally use Espresso and JUnit for these tests


From what I can tell you are trying to write instrumentation tests with Espresso but have your test in the test/java package which is for unit tests.  In that case you need to move your test class to the androidTest/java package.
