Q:In my application, when we browse the file from sdcard the file will be .text, .jpg and mpeg4ie video file.  I want to store each file type into a particular folder.  For example, .text files go to the text folder.  My question is when I select the file, how do I check the file extension?

A:I would get the file name as a String, split it into an array with "." as the delimiter, and then get the last index of the array, which would be the file extension. For example:

public class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filename = "image.jpg";
        String filenameArray[] = filename.split("\\\\.");
        String extension = filenameArray[filenameArray.length-1];
        System.out.println(extension);
    }
}


Which outputs:

jpg
