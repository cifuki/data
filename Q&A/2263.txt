Q:I want my application user to be able to share/recommend my app to other users. I use the ACTION_SEND intent. I add plain text saying something along the lines of: install this cool application. But I can't find a way to enable users to directly go to the install screen of market place for instance. All I can provide them with is a web link or some text.
In other words I am looking for a very direct way for android users to have my app installed.

Thanks for any help/pointers,

Thomas

A:This will let you choose from email, whatsapp or whatever.

try { 
    Intent shareIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);  
    shareIntent.setType("text/plain");
    shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "My application name");
    String shareMessage= "\
Let me recommend you this application\
\
";
    shareMessage = shareMessage + "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=" + BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID +"\
\
";
    shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, shareMessage);  
    startActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, "choose one"));
} catch(Exception e) { 
    //e.toString();
}
