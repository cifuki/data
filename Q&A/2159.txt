Q:I'm using Eclipse to develop applications for android, and I want to integrate Admob to make money.
The tutorial says I should watch the LogCat to find ID, but where is it?


When I run in either the test mode or the real mode, sometimes the eclipse will notify that Ads returned, yet it does not show in the emu... can anyone explain?

A:If you are running admob ads on an emulator then there is no ID.  just use the AdManager method and set it to TEST_EMULATOR like the logcat says.  If you run on an actual device with usb debugging and watch the logcat, the ID will appear in there.
