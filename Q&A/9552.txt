Q:Using Eclipse (Juno SR2) with all the latest updates for Android (ADT plugin v21.1.0) cannot see the new Galaxy S4 as an available device via the USB connection.

Per the Samsung website the correct driver software is "Samsung_USB_Driver_for_Mobile_Phones_v1.5.14.0.ext" (which happens to be the same driver that I have been successfully using with a Samsung Note for the past 18 months).

Even when I go to a command prompt and type "adb.exe devices" to list the connected devices the list is empty.

From within the GS4 I have enabled the allow "unknown sources" for installation of applications, though the "allow debug" checkbox doesn't seem to be included anymore.

Interestingly enough, Windows Explorer does show the handset just fine and I am able to surf the device from Windows.

Any suggestions on how to make Eclipse/Android ADB see the device?

It should be in Developer Options. If your device is running Android 4.2, Developer Options is hidden by default. To enable it:


Go into Settings > About
Tap on the Build Number entry seven times (Toasts will appear to help you keep count)
Press BACK, and Developer Options should be in the Settings list
