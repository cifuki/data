Q:I have 2 activities: Activity1 and Activity2.
In each of this activities there is a button that leads me to a third activity (MainActivity). In MainActivity I want to know from which activity page was called.

A:You can use the putExtra attribute of the Intent to pass the name of the Activity.

Calling Activity,

Intent intent = new Intent(this, Next.class);
intent.putExtra("activity","first");
startActivity(intent);


Next Activity,

Intent intent = getIntent();
String activity = intent.getStringExtra("activity");


Now in the string activity you will get the name from which Activity it has came.
