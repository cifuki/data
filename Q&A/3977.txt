Q:I have several genymotion emulators for different API levels. The problem is this:


I run the app on a single emulator with the option 'same device for future launches' checked.
I open another emulator.
I run the the app again.


After this, the app only runs on the first emulator and I can't figure out how do I show the dialog (select target) again to run the app on both emulators.

A:Click Run \xe2\x86\x92 Edit Configurations...



Then uncheck Use same device for future launches



As mentioned by @B-GangsteR, you can also launch your app on multiple devices at the same time. To do this, select targets using ctrl key.
