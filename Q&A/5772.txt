Q:I am changing my android mobile app to support both tablets and mobile phone. For this I am changing my activity class into fragment. In my activity class I have an instance of my application class created as below:

appCtx = (UnityMobileApp) getApplication();


Where UnityMobileApp is my Application class.

Now I want to create the same instance in my fragment class. Can you guys please help me solve this?

A:Use appCtx = (UnityMobileApp) getActivity().getApplication(); in your fragment.
