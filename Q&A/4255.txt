Q:I want to use the same button to perform 2 different methods.
One method when user single clicks it and a second method (different) when the user LONG clicks it.

I use this for the single short click (which works great):

Button downSelected = (Button) findViewById(R.id.downSelected);
        downSelected.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                method();
                }
            }

        });


I've tried to add a longClickListener but it didn't work.

Appreciate any ideas on how to solve this.

Thanks!

A:I've done it before, I just used:

down.setOnLongClickListener(new OnLongClickListener() { 
        @Override
        public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            return true;
        }
    });


Per documentation:


  public void setOnLongClickListener
  (View.OnLongClickListener l)
  
  Since: API Level 1 Register a callback
  to be invoked when this view is
  clicked and held. If this view is not
  long clickable, it becomes long
  clickable.


Notice that it requires to return a boolean, this should work.
