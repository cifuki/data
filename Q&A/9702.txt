I'm working on new permission model (Android 6.0 Marshmallow) and I wonder is there a way to open the application's permission window programmatically?



not only application details 



I managed to open the second screen using something like this

private void goToSettings() {
    Intent myAppSettings = new Intent(Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS, Uri.parse("package:" + getPackageName()));
    myAppSettings.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT);
    myAppSettings.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
    startActivity(myAppSettings);
}


But I have no idea how to open the first one.

Your help will be much appreciated :)

A:This is not possible. You can open the App settings screen but not the permissions setting screen.

Refer to this question for more explanations. 

Here I am sharing code to open application setting screen,

Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction(Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS);
Uri uri = Uri.fromParts("package", activity.getPackageName(), null);
intent.setData(uri);
context.startActivity(intent);


For more you can refer Open Application Settings Screen Android
