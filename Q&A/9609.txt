Q:I am new to Android and Android Studio.

During my learning I came across the Google Play Services for Ads and all. 

I tried to enable proguard in my project but reading the below link proguard.

The problem is that I am not able to find proguard-project.txt or proguard.cfg in my project structure...

Instead there is a proguard-rules.txt in my project structure...

How can I find these missing files and configure proguard in my project...

Please help...

A:Use the proguard-rules.txt file instead. Proguard doesn't attach any special significance to the name of its rule input files; it uses whatever's set up in your build files, which for new projects created in recent versions of Android Studio, is:

buildTypes {
     release {
         runProguard false
         proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.txt'
     }
 }


The proguard-android.txt file lives inside your SDK, and contains reasonable Android-wide defaults that all projects should use.
