Q:Is it possible to use same sender id for more applications? Now I have 18 application (different language and some functionality) which use same backend. Now I am implementing push notifications with GCM. But backend team preffer to have only one google project - SENDER ID for all applications. 
Did anyone try it? Is this scenario possible? What are the drawbacks?

Thanks

A:Developers are perfectly welcome (and encouraged) to use the same sender ID / API key for all of their apps.

When you send a message, you specify a registration ID, which is implicitly linked to the package name of the app + device where it was generated. Only the app which requested the registration ID will receive your message.
