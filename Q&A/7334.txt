Q:I have just updated my android SDK tools to the newly released version (tools version 22, platform tools version 17)

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError


The .classpath file was modified. The update in added a line :

<classpathentry exported="true" kind="con" path="com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.DEPENDENCIES"/>


Before the SDK tools update, all my projects worked well !!

I corrected my problem in this way :


In the project properties (eclipse) -> java build path -> order and export make sure that all your jars in the libs folder are checked.
And "Android Tools -> Fix Project Properties"
And "Project -> Clean"


But I don't understand why! Would anybody have an explanation ?

A:I fixed it by going into Java Build Path > Order and Export tab.

Click everything in the list "Android Private Libraries".

Then "Project -> Clean". That fixed my issue.

Just over 1.5 days on this issue, solved my problem by reading Google+.
