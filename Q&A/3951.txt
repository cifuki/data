Q:Can someone clearly explain with examples what each of the span flags like SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE and SPAN_MARK_MARK mean and when to use what flags?

I do not understand the official documentation when it says:


  Spans of type SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE do not expand to include text
  inserted at either their starting or ending point.


Does "expand to include" refer to edits made after inserting the spans?

Does it mean that these flags do NOT affect Spannables with immutable text?

A:Does "expand to include" refer to edits made after inserting the spans?


Yes. For example, let's suppose we have the following:

The quick fox jumped.

If we used SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE on the boldface span, and we insert text in the middle of the span, it is still boldface:

The quick brown fox jumped.

However, if we insert text at the beginning or the end of the boldface span, the inserted text is not boldface:

The really quick fox jumped.

If, however, we had used SPAN_INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE, then inserting text at the beginning would be included as part of the span, and we would have:

The really quick fox jumped.


  Does it mean that these flags do NOT affect Spannables with immutable text?


I would say that they have limited use for immutable text. Mostly, these will be used with SpannableStringBuilder or things that use one under the covers (e.g., EditText).
