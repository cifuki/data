Q:The Android doc says "Like activities and the other components, services run in the main thread of the application process."

Is the main thread here the same thing as UI thread?

A:Looks like it. Quoted from http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/05/painless-threading.html: "When an application is launched, the system creates a thread called "main" for the application. The main thread, also called the UI thread...", Official API document.
