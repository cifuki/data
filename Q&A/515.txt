Q:So I'm reading Android 6 for Programmers: An App-Driven Approach and the first two app examples I had no issues with the examples, this time the FlagQuiz example when loaded in Android Studio 3.0 Canary-3 I'm getting this error which isn't letting me build the project:


  Error:Unsupported method: BaseConfig.getApplicationIdSuffix().
  The version of Gradle you connect to does not support that method.
  To resolve the problem you can change/upgrade the target version of Gradle you connect to.
  Alternatively, you can ignore this exception and read other information from the model.


You can download the source from the book site here to test with the same code base that I'm testing from.

A:Alright I figured out how to fix this issue.


Open build.gradle and change the gradle version to the recommended version:
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.0' to
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.2'
Hit 'Try Again'
In the messages box it'll say 'Fix Gradle Wrapper and re-import project' Click that, since the minimum gradle version is 3.3
A new error will popup and say The SDK Build Tools revision (23.0.1) is too low for project ':app'. Minimum required is 25.0.0 - Hit Update Build Tools version and sync project
A window may popup that says Android Gradle Plugin Update recommended, just update from there.


Now the project should be runnable now on any of your android virtual devices.
