Q:I have two points in the canvas, now I'm able to draw a line between those points like this below image by using 

This code canvas.drawLine(p1.x, p1.y, p2.x, p2.y, paint);


I want to draw the arc between two points like below image.



How can I draw like this.

A:Finally I got the solution from this code:

float radius = 20;
final RectF oval = new RectF();
oval.set(point1.x - radius, point1.y - radius, point1.x + radius, point1.y+ radius);
Path myPath = new Path();
myPath.arcTo(oval, startAngle, -(float) sweepAngle, true);


To calculate startAngle, use this code:

int startAngle = (int) (180 / Math.PI * Math.atan2(point.y - point1.y, point.x - point1.x));


Here, point1 means where you want to start drawing the Arc. sweepAngle means the angle between two lines. We have to calculate that by using two points like the blue points in my Question image.
