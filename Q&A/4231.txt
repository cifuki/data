Q:I am in the process of moving my current projects huge application into Android Studio and Gradle. I am currently stuck on the following issue:

Error:(87, 9) Execution failed for task ':App:processDebugManifest'.
> Manifest merger failed : Attribute application@label value=(@string/app_label) from AndroidManifest.xml:87:9
    is also present at ANDROID_APPLICATION:Library:unspecified:9:18 value=(@string/app_name)
    Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:label"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:82:5 to override


I have tried adding the following attributes to the main AndroidManifest.xml file:

tools:replace="android:label, *App Name*"
tools:replace="android:label, @string/app_label"
tools:replace="android:label"


None of these attribute definitions works. What am I doing wrong?

A:Give this a try:

Add this to <manifest/>

xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"


Add this to <application/>

tools:node="replace"


Based on this, it should override all the elements. "Replace the lower priority declaration with the annotated one."
