Q:Recently I see that is possible to debug app development by use WIFI instead of USB debug method. I make a search and I found an app called abdWireless but I have a problem.

How I can tell to Eclipse to connect via Wifi method?

I think that it is an automatic process, but on start debug it open the Emulator.

Someone? :)
Bye

A:First, run 'adb connect ip:port', like adb connect <phone-ip-address>, from console/terminal (with your IP address and port of cause). This makes adb service to connect to your device via network. 
Port 5555 is used by default if no port number is specified.

Then check that device is correctly connected: run adb devices from console/terminal (make sure you remove usb cable from device). If adb devices does not list your device, then you have some entirely different issue.



If you've connected your device via adb and you can see the device in adb devices list, but your eclipse still starts emulator,:


Go to Run->Debug Configuration -> [your configuration]
In your configuration go to Target tab and select Manual  




This will popup device selection each time you start the app from eclipse. So you will be able to explicitly state which emulator/device to use. 

To disconnect your device, adb disconnect <phone-ip-address>
