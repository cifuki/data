Q:I have an android application that I exported a signed version perfectly on March 17, 2013. Then on March 19, 2013 I updated the Facebook SDK and Android SDK Manager, then tried to export my a signed version of my app again. First mistake.

Now I've been experiencing one of the two issues ever since and I can't export a new signed version of my app to re-upload the Google Play store. 


Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1
or my Android Application Crashes when I'm exporting it.


I've tried numerous solutions I've found on the web and still am experiencing no luck. I even removed and re-installed Eclipse, the ADT, and Facebook SDK. Still, I'm having issues. 

Eclipse actually crashes which is really odd. Any ideas?

Update:
So, I am no longer getting the "Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1" any more on export of signed app. Eclipse just crashes on export of signed app. Any ideas? I have all the latest software: eclipse, facebook sdk, android sdk, etc. I'm running the latest version of  Mac OS X.

A:So here's how I fixed the issue, I'm sure someone will have this issue again. what worked for me was turning off automatic build. Something so small. Thanks for the help! 

*Also, the answers above worked for others.
