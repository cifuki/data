Q:I've red a number of posts and articles but it's not working for me. I am not able to add/use the Google Play Services in my project. 

My steps:


I start a project which is using the Google Api's 2.2
I have download the Google Play Services using the SDK
I import the Google Play Services into my Eclipse workspace
Adding Google Play Services as a dependency in my project: Project -> Properties -> Android -> Library, Add -> google-play-services_lib


Steps 1 till 3 are fine, but I think the problem is in step 4. Nothing happens after I do step 4, I'm not seeing any change in my Project structure: no library is added. These steps are also described here.

The reason I know it is not working is because any import from the Google Play Services is giving an unresolved error.

A:I found that the play services libproject has to be imported onto the same physical drive as your project. (check the 'Copy projects into workspace' checkbox when you import)
