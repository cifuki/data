Q:In my android app, i want to test some features with proguard on.

I don't need to really "debug" it, but i want proguard to run when i hit run in eclipse. I don't want to export the binary every time (so, in release mode) and save as apk and get it to the device to test.

Is there any way to run proguard in this way?

Update:

It seems like this is possible if you are not using Eclipse; as question title does not include Eclipse, there are multiple correct answers to this question.

A:Old Answer :

http://developer.android.com/tools/help/proguard.html

ProGuard runs only when you build your application in release mode, so you do not have to deal with obfuscated code when you build your application in debug mode. 

When you build your application in release mode, either by running ant release or by using the Export Wizard in Eclipse, the build system automatically checks to see if the proguard.config property is set. If it is, ProGuard automatically processes the application's bytecode before packaging everything into an .apk file. Building in debug mode does not invoke ProGuard, because it makes debugging more cumbersome.

It is possible with the new gradle build system. You need to set minifyEnabled to true in your build.gradle file. Generally you have pro-guard running in release mode. There are other options available like shrinking resources. You can find some useful info @ http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system

Also do have a look @

http://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle.html

 android {
   ...
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled false
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
     debug {

        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
   }
 }
