Q:I'm using Android Studio. How can I manually install and use Gradle within Android Studio. 

I've downloaded Gradle from http://www.gradle.org/downloads version gradle-2.1-all.zip.

When I open the zipped file I can see bin, docs etc, but I don't know where to copy it. And even after copying how to use it within Android..

A:Android Studio will automatically use the Gradle wrapper and pull the correct version of Gradle rather than use a locally installed version.  If you wish to use a new version of Gradle, you can change the version used by studio.  Beneath your Android Studio's project tree, open the file gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties.  Change this entry:

distributionUrl=http\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.1-all.zip
