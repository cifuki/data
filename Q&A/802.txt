Q:So this morning I started updating to the latest version of my project libraries.

I'm trying to update GCM to the latest version 9.2.0, but I get this error:


  Error:Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'.
  Please fix the version conflict either by updating the version of the google-services plugin (information about the latest version is available at https://bintray.com/android/android-tools/com.google.gms.google-services/) or updating the version of com.google.android.gms to 9.0.0.


This is how I have my code:

dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.2'
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
    classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.8'
}


And then:

dependencies {
    ...

    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:9.2.0"

    ...
}


Anyone having the same issue/fixed the same issue?

Thanks.

EDIT

Apparently you have to apply your GSM plugin at the bottom of your app/build.gradle file. Else, version 9.2.0 will cause conflict in your project.

For reference, this is how my app/build.gradle file looks like now:

apply plugin: "com.android.application"
apply plugin: "com.neenbedankt.android-apt"

android {
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...

    // Google Cloud Messaging
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:9.2.0"

    ...
}

apply plugin: "com.google.gms.google-services"

A:Do you have the line  

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' 


line at the bottom of your app's build.gradle file?

I saw some errors when it was on the top and as it's written here, it should be at the bottom.
