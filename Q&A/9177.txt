Q:I've added debug strings (using Log.d()) and want to see them in context from the contents of logCat. The "save" icon for LogCat has a "Save selected items" hint, but there's got to be a quick way to just save the entire contents, or select the entire contents, but I don't see how to do it.

A:You are not getting the answer you are looking for, are you.

Two ways to do what you want:
1) right-click in the logcat messages window, choose select all.  Then your save will be all logcat messages in that window (including the ones scrolled out of view).
2) when focus is in logcat messages window, type control-A, this will select all messages.  Then save etc. etc.
