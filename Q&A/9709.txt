Q:I am looking for an efficient way to find out if a resource (mostly a drawable) is used in Java or in an XML file.

The problem is, that on my current project the drawables are changed often and now I have some drawables, which might never be used.

Is there a tool/way to find those unused drawables without search each filename in the whole project?

A:I wrote a tool based on python to solve this problem. As this is not the place to share it directly, I created a project page which is now offline.

UPDATE:
The development has stopped since Lint can do the same and is already included in the Android SDK.
