Q:I have a series of EditText entries and would like it so when the user hits the enter key it will go to the next Editext.  I know how do this one at a time but is there a way to tell all of the edittext controls to use the same function that checks the key entry and advances the cursor.  It seems kind of crazy to have one function for each of the EditTexts

A:Much simpler than sniffing keys: try setting android:singleLine="true" and android:imeOptions="actionNext" (at least for single-line entry textviews). Read more in the Android documentation for TextView.

Update: singleLine is deprecated now, but you can leave it out. It's the default behavior for editable text as long as you don't explicitly set android:inputType="textMultiLine", and inputType overrides the suggested singleLine replacement of maxLines="1" for editable text anyways.
