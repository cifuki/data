Q:I'm trying to get the SSID of the WIFI network when my android device is connected to WIFI.

I've registered a BroadcastReceiver listening for android.net.wifi.supplicant.CONNECTION_CHANGE . I get the notification when WIFI is disconnected or reconnected. Unfortunately, I can't get the network's SSID.

I'm using the following code to find the SSID:

WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) context.getSystemService(context.WIFI_SERVICE);
WifiInfo wifiInfo = wifiManager.getConnectionInfo();
String ssid = wifiInfo.getSSID();


Instead of the SSID, I get the string <unknown ssid> back.

These are the permissions in the manifest (I've added ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE just to check, I don't actually need it)

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>


Why does this happen? How can I get the actual SSID? Is the broadcast fired to early, before the connection is established? Is there another broadcast I should listen to? I'm only interested in WIFI connections, not 3G connections.

Update: I just checked, wifiInfo.getBSSID() returns null.

A:I listen for WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION in a broadcast receiver

if (WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION.equals (action)) {
        NetworkInfo netInfo = intent.getParcelableExtra (WifiManager.EXTRA_NETWORK_INFO);
        if (ConnectivityManager.TYPE_WIFI == netInfo.getType ()) {


I check for netInfo.isConnected (). Then I am able to use

WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) getSystemService (Context.WIFI_SERVICE);
WifiInfo info = wifiManager.getConnectionInfo ();
String ssid  = info.getSSID();


UPDATE

From android 8.0 onwards we wont be getting SSID of the connected network unless GPS is turned on.
