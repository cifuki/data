Q:What is the correct way to handle an orientation change when using Fragments?

I have a landscape layout that contains 2 fragments (instantiated in code into FrameLayouts). When I switch to portrait mode (the layout of which contains only one FrameLayout that holds the left pane only), the right hand fragment is no longer required.

I am receiving an error:

E/AndroidRuntime(4519): Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No view found for id 0x7f060085 for fragment myFragment{418a2200 #2 id=0x7f060085}


which is assume is my activity trying to re-attach the fragment where it was before the orientation change but as the view that contains the fragment does not exist in portrait mode the error is thrown.

I have tried the following hide/remove/detach methods but still get the error. What is the correct way to tell a fragment it is not needed any more and do not try to display?

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle b) {
    super.onCreate(b);
    Fragment f = getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.fragholder2);

    //rightPane is a framelayout that holds my fragment.
    if (rightPane == null && f != null) {
         FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
         ft.hide(f);     // This doesnt work
         ft.remove(f);   // neither does this
         ft.detach(f);   // or this
         ft.commit;
    }
}

A:I ran into the same problem and I think I figured out another solution. This solution may be better because you don't have to add the fragment to the back stack.

Remove the right hand side fragment from your activity in Activity.onSaveInstanceState() before calling super.onSaveInstanceState(). This works for me:

public MyActivity extends Activity
{   
    @Override
    public onCreate(Bundle state)
    {
        super.onCreate(state);

        // Set content view
        setContentView(R.layout.my_activity);

        // Store whether this is a dual pane layout
        mDualPane = findViewById(R.id.rightFragHolder) != null;

        // Other stuff, populate the left fragment, etc.
        .
        .
        .
        if (mDualPane)
        {
            mRightFragment = new RightFragment();
            FragmentManager fm = getFragmentManager();
            FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
            ft.replace(R.id.rightFragHolder, mRightFragment);
            ft.commit()
        }
    }


    @Override
    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle state)
    {
        if (mDualPane)
        {
            FragmentManager fm = getFragmentManager();
            FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
            ft.remove(mRightFragment);
            ft.commit()
        }

        super.onSaveInstanceState(state);
    }


    private boolean mDualPane;
    private Fragment mRightFragment;
}
