Q:Can anyone explain (or point me to a link that explains) the difference between state_activated, state_selected, state_pressed, and state_focused for ListView items? Are they all valid states for ListViews? Does it matter if touch or a keyboard are being used? This link no longer seems to be valid.

Many thanks!

A:state_selected is used when an item is selected using a
keyboard/dpad/trackball/etc.
state_activated is used when View.setActivated(true) is called. This
is used for "persistent selection" (see Settings on tablet for
instance)
state_pressed is used when the user is pressing the item either
through touch or a keyboard or a mouse
state_focused is used if the item is marked focusable and it receives
focus either through the user of a keyboard/dpad/trackball/etc. or if
the item is focusable in touch mode
