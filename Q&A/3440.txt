Q:I'm getting this error when trying to run unit tests from Eclipse with an Android Project. The list of Instrumentation Test Runners is empty in the Android preferences.


  [2009-06-17 23:57:51 - MyApp] ERROR:
  Application does not specify a
  android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner
  instrumentation or does not declare
  uses-library android.test.runner


It's also annoyingly decided that because I tried to run a unit test once, that's what I always want to do.

A:In the Run Configuration you may have Android JUnit Test, if there are any new launch configuration entries inside this, you delete it and then run your application it will run.

NOTE - This is likely to be the solution if you tried to run the test case before adding the correct lines to the manifest as described in the answer from Josef. If you have done this, delete the configuration (which will be complaining that no instrumentation test runner has been specified in its header) and then run it as an Android Junit Test again and it will create a valid configuration picking up the correct stuff that you have added to the manifest (see Josef's answer for this).
