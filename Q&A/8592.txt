Q:What is difference between getCount() and getChildCount() in ListView?

A:getCount() returns you a count of items in Adapter (total in list), getChildCount() is a ViewGroup method that returns you number of subviews. ListView actively reuses views so if your list has 1000 items getCount() will return 1000, getChildCount() - around 10 or so...
