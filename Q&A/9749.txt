Q:I'm following the steps to enable remote debugging (https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/debugging). When I reach step 4, Chrome for Desktop returns with "This webpage is not available".

"Enable USB Web Debugging" is checked in Chrome for Android.

"USB Debugging" is enabled on my device (rooted Nexus S, CM9).

The "adb devices" command return with, "device number device".

The "adb forward..." command returns with:
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *

I'm running the latest ADB on Windows 7, cmd as Administrator.

A:I found that I had to have USB debugging enabled on Chrome and on my device.


Chrome for Mobile - Settings > Developer Tools > [x] Enable USB Web debugging
Device - Settings > Developer options >  [x] USB debugging
Connect Device to Computer
Enable port forwarding on Computer

C:\\adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote
Go to http://localhost:9222 in Chrome for Computer
