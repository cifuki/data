Q:I'm driven crazy with this:

Log.d("STATE", Environment.getExternalStorageState());
File f = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM), "work_data");
Log.d("PATH", f.getAbsolutePath());
if (!f.exists()) {
    Log.d("MAKE DIR", f.mkdirs() + "");
}


The output log looks like this:

STATE     mounted
PATH      /mnt/sdcard/DCIM/work_data
MAKE DIR  false


I made sure to add the correct permission:

 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/> 


But I don't know why it could not create the folder. I also used mkdir() step by step but the result is the same. Please help me. I have googled so much and spent at least 2 days on this stupid thing. Thanks for your help!!

EDITING:

Sorry everyone! I had added <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/> in <application> tag. this was my mistake! But thank you all for reply.

A:I have had the same problem and I have searched everything for a week trying to find the answer. I think I found it and I think it's ridiculously easy, you have to put the uses-permission statement in the right place...

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.company.name" 
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="0.2">

    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="8" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />


When I had it inside the <application></application> section it did not work.
