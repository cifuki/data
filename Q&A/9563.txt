Q:While using Android Studio just now I was editing an XML file in the editor and I got this error in the Preview and Design windows:

 Exception raised during rendering: Unable to find the layout for Action Bar.


I've tried restarting Android Studio, my Laptop and Googling for the answer but I can't find anything. Has anybody experienced anything similar?

A:I had this kind of error. On My Mac, there is API 22. If I choose it this error will appear. So clicking on API 21 or below would solve your problem



You probably need to update your tools
