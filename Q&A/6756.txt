Q:I have a class that is currently extending Activity and I have methods like findViewById, ArrayAdapter etc.
I want to turn it into an independent class but all the above methods become undefined. What is the problem? Shouldn't importing the classes be enough? For eg, I import android.view.View for findViewById but it still makes no difference.
Please advise.

A:you should pass the instance of your Activity to your Second Class on the constructor like this : 

In your Activity Instanciate your Class like this : 

MyClass instance = new MyClass(this);


And in your second Class , the constructor will be like this : 

public class MyClass {

public Activity activity; 
//.... other attributes 

public MyClass( Activity _activity){

   this.activity = _activity;
//other initializations...

}
}


and then when you want to use the findViewById() method , you can do like this : 

EditText txt = (EditText)this.activity.findViewById(R.id.txt);
