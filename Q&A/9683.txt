Q:I want to know about intercepting an incoming sms for a specific key word EX:"Hi", so that I can read that sms containing "Hi" in it & delete it after reading the msg, & if that msg doesn't contain any such text then it wouldn't be deleted and instead saved in the inbox. Guys please help me I am finding it very difficult to perform this functionality.

A:Look for Broadcast Receiver, this is dependent on the apps installed on the phone but you can give your app priority for listening to messages. Although, when a notification is shown, the message won't be in the SMS Database yet, so you will need to use abortBroadcast() to stop other apps being notified. See example below:

public class MessageReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
             Bundle pudsBundle = intent.getExtras();
             Object[] pdus = (Object[]) pudsBundle.get("pdus");
             SmsMessage messages =SmsMessage.createFromPdu((byte[]) pdus[0]);    
             Log.i(TAG,  messages.getMessageBody());
                 if(messages.getMessageBody().contains("Hi")) {
                     abortBroadcast();
                 }
    }


And you would need to declare the receiver in the manifest, like so:

 <receiver android:name="com.encima.smsreceiver.MessageReceiver" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter android:priority="999">
        <action android:name="android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED"></action>
    </intent-filter>
 </receiver>


Finally, make sure you have the permission to RECEIVE_SMS in the manifest, hope that helps!
