Q:Just wondering how you handle the following problem: a result is calculated depending on two spinners' selected items. To handle the UI things, i.e. a user picks a new item in one of the spinners, I install a listener using setOnItemSelectedListener for the spinner in my onCreate() method of the activity.

Now: that works, of course, fine. The listener's work is to trigger a new calculation of the result.

The problem: because I intercept onPause() onResume() to save/restore the last state, I got a method that sets these two spinners' selected item programmatically like in here:

startSpinner.setSelection(pStart);
destSpinner.setSelection(pDest);


These two calls invoke the listeners, too! My calculation method for the result plus the notification of a new result set is invoked twice here!

A stupid direct approach for this would be to have a boolean variable disabling whatever the listener does inside, setting it before setting the selected items and resetting it afterwards.
Okay. But is there a better method??

I don't want listeners to be called by code - actions, only by user actions! :-(

How do you do it?
Thanks!

A:I have an easier, and I think, better solution. Since I had to refresh the spinners even after initialization, this is a more generic approach.
