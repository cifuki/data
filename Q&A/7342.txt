Q:Accept my apologies in advance if this is the incorrect place to post this question as I am unsure what would be.

What I am trying to accomplish is to record a custom even using Firebase analytics that produces a similar report in the Firebase console to their example of the select_content event. It is triggered as follows:

    FirebaseAnalytics mFirebaseAnalytics = FirebaseAnalytics.getInstance(this);
    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.ITEM_ID, "ID");
    bundle.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.ITEM_NAME, "NAME");
    bundle.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.CONTENT_TYPE, "image");
    mFirebaseAnalytics.logEvent(FirebaseAnalytics.Event.SELECT_CONTENT, bundle);


and more specifically the string after FirebaseAnalytics.Param.CONTENT_TYPE can be any value and will produce a report in the console as shown below:



I create my own custom events as:

Bundle params2 = new Bundle();
params2.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.VALUE, "Google Play Games Sign out Button");
mFirebaseAnalytics.logEvent("Main_Activity_Button_Pressed", params2);


and the report produced for this event shown below does not appear to take into account the value I have added.



Is it possible to accomplish what I am trying to do, and if so what is the correct way to implement this?

Update: Seems this is not possible for testing purposes as I recently discovered this:

which explains why my custom parameters do not appear in the console.

A:I believe any params attached to a custom event are considered custom params (even if you use those from FirebaseAnalytics.Param class) and therefore the values are not represented directly in your reports as per the docs here:


  Custom parameters: Custom parameters are not represented directly in your Analytics reports, but they can be used as filters in audience definitions that can be applied to every report. Custom parameters are also included in data exported to BigQuery if your app is linked to a BigQuery project.
