Q:I have implemented drawerlayout which slides from the right but it does not shift the activity the right like facebook does (See below image). How do I push the current activity to the right side when user taps on opendrawer button like in the above image.Currently it appears on top of activity and drops shadow.I really appreciate any help .  Thanks in advance.

A:I don't think you can implement it with the stock DrawerLayout, however with SlidingMenu you can, the GitHub repo here should explain all you need
