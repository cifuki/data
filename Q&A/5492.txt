Q:I currently have a table called User which has a id column which is created as 

'INTEGER PRIMARY KEY'

Lets say I have created two users so the table has id 1 and 2

If I delete the second user and create a third the id is 2, I need this to be 3

So it seems Android is selecting the next available id, how can I change this to its more like  a sequence number?

Regards

A:Make it INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL. Here's what the docs say:


  If a column has the type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT then... the ROWID chosen
  for the new row is at least one larger than the largest ROWID that has
  ever before existed in that same table. 
  
  The behavior implemented by the AUTOINCREMENT keyword is subtly
  different from the default behavior. With AUTOINCREMENT, rows with
  automatically selected ROWIDs are guaranteed to have ROWIDs that have
  never been used before by the same table in the same database. And the
  automatically generated ROWIDs are guaranteed to be monotonically
  increasing.
