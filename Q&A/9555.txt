Q:As stated in style.xml, there is a weird error, which shows Cannot resolve symbol 'Theme', which is quite strange.

See pic of the error :- 


My Project Specs:-

Using Android Studio 3.0

and gradle version 3.0.0

and distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.1-all.zip

Edit:- 

Tried clearing the cache by going to File > Invalidate Cache/Restart > Invalidate and Restart, but to no avail, as the error persists.

A:Another possible reason is: Google's maven repository is not set for the build script.

Open your project's main build.gradle add this line:

buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()  <-- this
        // Be also sure that google() is before jcenter()
    }
}


Without this, it may not be able to download the Android Studio Gradle plugin 3.0+. It's not distributed in jCenter but in the Google's maven repository.
