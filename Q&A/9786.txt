Q:I was thinking of building an app on Android with Scala instead of the regular Java (or the equivalent I guess). Is it worth it?

Any problems and unnecessary headaches?

A:Working with Scala should be mostly painless, as the dex compiler just works with bytecode - which is exactly what Scala produces.

Your biggest problem then is the dependency on scala-library, as dex expects everything to be in a single Jar.  This is best handled with Proguard (which will also remove unused code and give you a smaller executable, ideal for mobile)



Current best practice is to use SBT with the Android plugin; It'll take care of everything for you: http://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin

If you must use Eclipse and the plugin supplied by Google, then you're going to have a non-standard directory structure.  I also wrote an article on how to deal with this: http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/scala-ide/Developing_for_Android

But be warned... it takes a lot more effort that way!
