Q:I need to check my application for memory leaks, i also need to see the memory allocation of my application.
I downloaded and installed eclipse memory analyzer, and it looks like the first step is to open a heap dump.
But what is a heap dump, how can i create a heap dump.
And how exactly am i going to use this software, I did some googling but i couldn't find any useful information 
thanks

A:When you debug your app, open DDMS in Eclipse. On the toolbar there is a heap dump button that you can use to generate a heap dump to view in Eclipse memory analyzer. This is only supported I think with the 1.6+ or 2.0+ SDK.
