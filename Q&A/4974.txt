Q:Either my English is not good enough or I just do not get it, but could anybody please explain to me what the "accent color" is and where it is used?



My question originated from the fact that I couldn't find a real description of when and how that color is used. Had I scrolled further down, I'd have found that description, too.

Sorry to interrupt, thanks for pointing me to it everybody.

A:You got good example in Material Design docs -> your palettes are shown in section "UI color application" - with blue colors being primary and pink being used for accents.

Here is what it means in practice (also FAB would most likely use pink background color)
