Q:Following directions on Android's main website to pull down sources, I'm looking at this command to initialize repo for the cupcake branch:

repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git -b cupcake

How can I view all available branches besides cupcake, i.e eclair, donut, etc...?

A:It doesn't seem to be possible using the "repo" script, but you can query the list of available branches using git:

$ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest.git
$ cd manifest
$ git branch -r


If you don't want to clone the repository just for this, you can see the branches on the web interface.
