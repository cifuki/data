Q:In Eclipse we were able to add permissions in AndroidManifest.xml by going to AndroidManifest.xml->Permission-> Adding permissions. 

How to add permissions in Android Studio? How can we get a list of all the permissions that we can add to an Activity ?

A:You can only type them manually, but the content assist helps you there, so it is pretty easy.

Add this line

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission."/> 


and hit ctrl + space after the dot (or cmd + space on Mac). If you need an explanation for the permission, you can hit ctrl + q.
