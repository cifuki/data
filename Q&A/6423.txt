Q:I'm trying to install the Android Developer Tools on my Windows 7 computer, so that I can use the Android emulator to test websites.

Android Developer's website, "Setting Up the ADT Bundle":


  The ADT Bundle provides everything you need to start developing apps... If you haven't already, go download the Android ADT Bundle.
  
  ...
  
  Install the SDK and Eclipse IDE
  
  Unpack the ZIP file (named adt-bundle-.zip) and save it to an appropriate location, such as a "Development" directory in your home directory.
  Open the adt-bundle-/eclipse/ directory and launch eclipse.
  That's it! The IDE is already loaded with the Android Developer Tools plugin and the SDK is ready to go.


My computer, after I carried out those exact steps:


  A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) must be available in order to run Eclipse. No Java virtual machine was found after searching the following locations:
  C:\\Development\\adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20130219\\eclipse\\jre\\bin\\javaw.exe
  javaw.exe in your current PATH


How do I get a Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit that will let me run the Android Developer Tools bundle?

(And, for bonus points, why isn't it included in the download, if the download is meant to provide "everything you need to start developing apps"?)

A:You can go here to download the Java JRE.

You can go here to download the Java JDK.

After that you need to set up your environmental variables in Windows:


Right-click My Computer
Click Properties
Go to Advanced System Settings
Click on the Advanced tab
Click on Environment Variables


EDIT: See screenshot for environmental variables
