A:Check android.os.Build.VERSION, which is a static class that holds various pieces of information about the Android OS a system is running.

If you care about all versions possible (back to original Android version), as in minSdkVersion is set to anything less than 4, then you will have to use android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK, which is a String that can be converted to the integer of the release.

If you are on at least API version 4 (Android 1.6 Donut), the current suggested way of getting the API level would be to check the value of android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT, which is an integer.

In either case, the integer you get maps to an enum value from all those defined in android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES:

SDK_INT value        Build.VERSION_CODES        Human Version Name       
    1                  BASE                      Android 1.0 (no codename)
