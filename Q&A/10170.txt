Q:I have just started using android, and have about 5 layout files finished. However, I just realized that I have been using @id and @+id interchangeably, but I'm not sure what the exact difference between the two are.

A:You need to use @+id when you are defining your own Id for a View.

Exactly from docs:


  The at-symbol (@) at the beginning of the string indicates that the
  XML parser should parse and expand the rest of the ID string and
  identify it as an ID resource. The plus-symbol (+) means that this is
  a new resource name that must be created and added to our resources
  (in the R.java file). There are a number of other ID resources that
  are offered by the Android framework. When referencing an Android
  resource ID, you do not need the plus-symbol, but must add the android
  package namespace.


And now i add for you practical example:

<Button 
   android:id="@+id/start"
   android:layout_width="wrap_content"
   android:layout_height="wrap_content"
/>

<Button 
   android:id="@+id/check"
   android:layout_width="wrap_content"
   android:layout_height="wrap_content"
   android:layout_below="@id/start"
/>


So here, you created two IDs, start and check. Then, in your application you are able to connect to them with findViewById(R.id.start).
And this android:layout_below="@id/start" refer to existing id.start and means that your Button with id check will be positioned below Button with id start.
