Q:Can anyone explain the question mark means in Android XML attributes?

<TextView    
    style="?android:attr/windowTitleStyle"
    More attributes
/>

A:The question mark means it's a reference to a resource value in the currently applied theme. See the linuxtopia Android Dev Guide or the android.com Dev Guide for more about it.

\\? escapes the question mark.
