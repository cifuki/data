Q:I need to send a date in JSON. The date string should look like this:


  "2013/5/15"


Instead , JSONObject.toString escapes it as follows:


  "2013\\ /5\\ /15"


I understand that this is done to allow json strings inside scripts tags, as this question explains:
JSON: why are forward slashes escaped?

But in my case I don't need it. In fact the server is returning an error. The server is not dealing with this and I can't fix the server, so I must fix it in the mobile client code.

I could do a String.replace after serializing it, but what if I actually wanted to include the "\\ /" string in any other part of the JSON?  

Is there a way to serialize a JSON object without escaping slashes? (If possible, without escaping anything)

Thanks in advance.

A:I finally opted for the quick and dirty trick of replacing the escaped slashes in the serialized string before sending it to the server. Luckily, JSONObject also escapes backslashes, so i must also unscape them. Now if I wanted to send "\\ /" intentionally the escaped string would be "\\\\/" and the result of replacing is the original string as intended.
