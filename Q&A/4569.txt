I am making a compound ui element that takes an Object (a player) and I want to pick the corresponding image for the team this player plays for(the player object has a string value for its image number.  I have the images in the resources folder of my project.

How do I specify the correct source for each player.  Is it a case of writing a huge number of if's and elses (checking the string value) and using res.getDrawable(R.drawable.no1) etc or is there a more elegant solution where I can use a string in some way to specify the path to the source?

A:I'd put the relation between Strings and images in a Map:

Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
map.put("blah", R.drawable.blah);
// etc...


Then, you can use the setImageResource(int) method:

ImageView image;
image.setImageResource(map.get("blah"));


Or, if the strings have the same name than the image (like in the case before), you can load the resource by using this method: Android and getting a view with id cast as a string
