Q:I've been developing on Eclipse for years and have just started a new project on Android Studio.

I'm noticing that every time I run a build, Android Studio collapses ALL the folders in the Project Files browser, such that they need to be re-expanded to get back to where I want them.

This is what I'm left with:


  -> app
  
  -> MyApplicationName


For me, this is incredibly annoying and unnecessarily disruptive to the development process.  Yet, I don't see a solution online, so I'm suspecting I'm missing something obvious...

Is there a way to prevent Studio from auto-collapsing the Project Files browser?

A:I think you want to use the "Project" view, and not the "Project Files" view. I had this problem when I first switched from Eclipse to Android Studio and found it was because I'd set the file browser (top left) to look at Project files and not Project. The normal Project view does much the same thing and doesn't collapse when running tests.
