Q:I am programming Android applications, and the best way here may or may not be the same as Java in general.

I simply want to be able to set a debug flag that will only execute certain portions of code when it's set to true\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93equiv to C++ setting a preprocessor #define DEBUG and using #ifdef DEBUG.

Is there an accepted or best way to accomplish this in Java?

Right now I'm just going to set a variable in my Application object, but I don't imagine this is the best way.

A:That's the way I do it:

// in some.class.with.Constants
public static final boolean DEV_MODE = true;

// in some other class
import static some.class.with.Constants.DEV_MODE;

if(DEV_MODE){
    Log.d('sometag', 'somemessage');
}
