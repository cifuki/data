Q:I been using Google Play in-app purchases (IAPs) for a long time, but recently (June 20, 2016) They updated the Payments Merchant Center so that test purchases are not shown anymore. I quote a recent email to developers:

"Previously, test purchases for one-time IAPs generated order IDs. Starting June 20, 2016, one-time IAPs will not generate order IDs and will not appear in the Merchant Center."

I have found no information regarding purchases (not subscriptions) in the link:
https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html
The page has a "Canceling completed test purchases" that only comments on subscriptions.

My question is, where do I cancel a test purchase, if they do not appear in Payments Merchant Center?

UPDATE- Official answer from Google Support:

Thanks for contacting Google Play Developer Support.
I checked into it and the Play Developer Console doesn\xe2\x80\x99t currently support cancelation of test IAP. The only ways is to either consume the IAP or wait the 14 days consumption time. 

UPDATE 2- Thanks to the answer below from Mike, I inserted the code below:

            Purchase premiumPurchase = inventory.getPurchase(Constants.SKU_PRO);
            if (premiumPurchase != null) {
                App.mHelper.consumeAsync(premiumPurchase, new IabHelper.OnConsumeFinishedListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onConsumeFinished(Purchase purchase, IabResult result) {
                        Log.d(TAG, "Test purchase is consumed.");
                    }
                });
            }


I only run this code to cancel the test purchase, and debug the complete purchase flow again.

A:The easiest way to cancel an in-app purchase is to consume it. If you use the Google provided IabHelper you can just call consumeAsync and pass in the Purchase. I maintain a function to consume all the app's in-app products; this is essentially a billing reset function for testing.
