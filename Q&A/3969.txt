Q:I am interested in writing applications for the iPhone and the Android platform. I was hoping to find a middleware / framework that abstracted away some of the differences in the APIs and allow me to specify the target platform at build time. Is there such a framework existing or planned?

A:Phonegap is a javascript/css/html based framework that targets the iPhone, Android, and the Blackberry. It (on the iphone at least) can be bundled as a native app too. The UI layer for these apps typically is built in html/javascript and can be slower than a true native app.

Adobe Flash And believe it or not, Adobe Flash can publish native binaries to ios, android, desktop and of course the web. The performance is reasonable, but not incredible. If you had a Flash game, you may be able to take it to mobile very easily. And this does not require any plugins of any sort. It actually creates a native standalone binary that runs on each platform.
