Q:How do disable and hide the address bar from a WebView?

A:There is no address bar in a WebView.

If you think you have a WebView, and you see an address bar, that is not your WebView. Rather, you are looking at the Browser application. Most likely, the URL you told the WebView to load did a redirect, and you did not intercept that redirect using a WebViewClient and shouldOverrideURLLoading().
