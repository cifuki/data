Q:I updated ADT through Eclipse today to version 21. Now when I open the SDK Manager I would expect there to be a folder like "Android 4.2 (API 17)", which would contain the SDK Platform and APIs, documentation, etc. However, instead I just get a folder called "API 17", and the only thing in it is "Google APIs", which I can't even install because 


  Installing this package also requires installing:
  - Missing SDK Platform Android, API 17


What do I do here? Thanks

A:I figured this out myself after some poking around. I went into the settings for the SDK Manager, cleared the cache, and told it to use HTTPS, then refreshed the listing and it all appeared normally.
