  J2ME/Android/BlackBerry - driving directions, route between two locations  




I'm just writing an App for displaying the route between two coords (lat, long) in google maps view.
Displaying an single coord (even with a marker) works fine, but how to draw route between two point with 2 markers?

I must admit that I'm quite new to Android and the maps-API...
