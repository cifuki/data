Q:I've downloaded an APK from web, using the default browser and it can't be opened from the Browser -> Downloads.

It tells me "Can't open file"

But I can use a file browser (like OI File Browser) to browse and open this APK, and it works well.

What could be the problem here? Is it about the HTTP header?

A:It shouldn't be HTTP headers if the file has been downloaded successfully and it's the same file that you can open from OI.

A shot in the dark, but could it be that you are not allowing installation from unknown sources, and that OI is somehow bypassing that?

Settings > Applications > Unknown sources...
