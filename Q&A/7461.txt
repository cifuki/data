A:I also had an issue downloading gradle through AndroidStudio. I tried the following.


Go to your AndroidStudio directory where you installed your studio Like D:\\User\\AndroidStudio
In AndroidStudio go to \\AndroidStudio\\plugins\\gradle\\lib and copy gradle.jar
Paste gradle.jar file in \\AndroidStudio\\lib directory.
Download gradle directly from Gradle
Copy the contents of gradle-1.6-bin.zip - After extracting zip file - (bin, media, init.d, lib folders) to \\AndroidStudio\\plugins\\gradle
Restart AndroidStudio

And after following all the steps listed above, if it is not working, Kindly check below things.

1) Please delete .gradle folder from your user like C:\\Document and Settings\\AndroidUser\\***\\.gradle

2) You can check your HTTP Proxy in Settings.

Hope this helps!
