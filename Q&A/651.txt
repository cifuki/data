Q:I am trying to run google map v2 on emulator, I am following this tutorial.
When I was trying to install required apk file on emulator, I am getting below error.

I tried to solve this using this tutorial.Followed all steps, added the path to paltform-tools to  environment path. Also after modifying the PATH variable started a new CommandPrompt window.

But getting the same error. I need to check my google map application on emulator.
Kindly suggest me.

'adb' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

A:Set the path of adb into System Variables. You can find adb in "ADT Bundle/sdk/platform-tools" Set the path and restart the cmd n then try again.

Or 

You can also goto the dir where adb.exe is located and do the same thing if you don't wanna set the PATH.

If you wanna see all the paths, just do

echo %PATH%
