Q:I've been trying to set up in-app billing for my first app, and have been using the android.test.purchased sku. The purchase come through, and I manage to get the SKU into my inventory, but, as the title says, onIabPurchaseFinished, is never called.

I think it may have something to do with this Log: "Couldn't save which view has focus because the focused view com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView@406743d0 has no id". That pops up, right before going of to Google Play. I'm not really sure what that means though...

Launching purchase:

mHelper.launchPurchaseFlow(this, sku, 10001, mPurchaseFinishedListener, "");


And the Listener:

IabHelper.OnIabPurchaseFinishedListener mPurchaseFinishedListener = new IabHelper.OnIabPurchaseFinishedListener() {

    @Override
    public void onIabPurchaseFinished(IabResult result, Purchase info) {
        System.out.println("Purchase Finish heard something");

        if (result.isFailure()) {
             Log.d(TAG, "Error purchasing: " + result);
             return;
        } else{
                Log.d(TAG,"Success!");
             }


    }
};

A:Try adding this to the Activity that calls mHelper.launchPurchaseFlow(..):

    @Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    Log.d(TAG, "onActivityResult(" + requestCode + "," + resultCode + "," + data);

    // Pass on the activity result to the helper for handling
    if (!mHelper.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {
        // not handled, so handle it ourselves (here's where you'd
        // perform any handling of activity results not related to in-app
        // billing...
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    }
    else {
        Log.d(TAG, "onActivityResult handled by IABUtil.");
    }
}
