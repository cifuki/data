Q:In my application, I have an EditText that user only have Read access not Write access.

In code I set android:enabled="false". 

Although the background of EditText changed to dark, when I click on it the keyboard pops up up and I can change text.

What should I set to disable EdidText?

Thanks.

A:I believe the correct would be to set android:editable="false".

And if you wonder why my link point to the attributes of TextView, you the answer is because EditText inherits from TextView:


  EditText is a thin veneer over
  TextView that configures itself to be
  editable.


Update:
As mentioned in the comments below, editable is deprecated (since API level 3). You should instead be using inputType (with the value none).
