Q:Why bundle has getParcelableArrayList, getParcelable methods; but
Intent has only putParcelableArrayListExtra method?
Can I transmit only object<T>, not ArrayList of one element?
Then, what is getParcelable for?

A:Intent provides bunch of overloading putExtra() methods.

Suppose you have a class Foo implements Parcelable properly, to put it into Intent in an Activity:

Intent intent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), NextActivity.class);
Foo foo = new Foo();
intent.putExtra("foo ", foo);
startActivity(intent);


To get it from intent in another activity:

Foo foo = getIntent().getExtras().getParcelable("foo");


Hope this helps.
