Unfortunately I deleted important files from my app.

A:For Eclipse:


  To restore a deleted Workbench resource with a state from the local
  history:
  
  
  In one of the navigation views, select the folder or project into
  which you want to restore a local history state
  From the resource's
  pop-up menu, select Restore from Local History.... The Restore From
  Local History dialog opens showing all files that were previously
  contained in the selected folder or project and all of their
  sub-folders.
  Check the files that you want to restore
  If you don't
  want to restore just the last state of a file you can select any other
  state of the file from the Local History list on the right hand side
  of the dialog. The bottom pane of the dialog shows the contents of the
  state.
  If you are done with all files click Restore.

For Android Studio / IntelliJ / AppCode:


  
  Go to the Project tool window and right-click the project node or just a folder, where the file used to exist
  On the context menu, choose Local History, and click Show History on the submenu
  The local history view for a project or folder shows you everything that you have done during the last few days. In the Action column of the lower part of the dialog box, select the action you want to roll back. In our case, this is the Deleting action. So doing, the upper part of the dialog box shows the tree view of changed files.
  If you want to restore the deleted file only, regardless of the other changes that have been done since then, you can select the file Lost.txt in the tree view and click the Revert button on the upper toolbar. The file will be restored silently.
