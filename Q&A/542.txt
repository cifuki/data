Q:I'm trying to publish a new version of my Android app to Google Play and get the following error? 


  This configuration cannot be published for the following reason(s):
      Version 1 is not served to any device configuration: all devices that might receive version 1 would receive version 4


I don't understand it. What does it mean?

A:This happened to me when I published two APKs (versions 3 and then 4) in a short space of time. Clicking "Deactivate" on the dropdown next to version 3 appeared to fix it.

My guess is that this is a very-poorly-worded error message meaning something like "your original APK hasn't been published to all the update servers yet, so some of them may miss that version entirely". But it's a bit of a guess.
