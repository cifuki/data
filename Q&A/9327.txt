Q:Is there any way to remove a Listener from a View in android? I have a Checkbox that I attached a CheckChangedListener to. The problem is that calling setChecked() on it causes my listener to fire.

If I can't just remove a listener, is there a way to prevent the listener from firing when I call setChecked() manually versus it being checked from a touch event?

A:Well, I found the answer. This doesnt appear to be documented anywhere, but I went through the code for the View class and if you pass null to the setClickListener methods, it will remove the listener.

checkbox.setOnCheckChangedListener(null);


This should work for any event listener.
