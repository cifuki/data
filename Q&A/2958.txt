Q:when I am signing the apk, I get "jarsigner: unable to sign jar: java.util.zip.ZipException: invalid entry compressed size (expected 463 but got 465 bytes)" this error message. The apk size is almost 1MB. When I reduce the size to 500KB, signing success. Why this so?..Any Idea?

A:You are trying to sign an already signed .apk.
You need to export an unsigned .apk file and then sign it with jarsigner.
