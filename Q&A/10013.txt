A:If you want to display an image file on the phone, you can do this:

private ImageView mImageView;
mImageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imageViewId);
mImageView.setImageBitmap(BitmapFactory.decodeFile("pathToImageFile"));


If you want to display an image from your drawable resources, do this:

private ImageView mImageView;
mImageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imageViewId);
mImageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.imageFileId);


You'll find the drawable folder(s) in the project res folder. You can put your image files there.
