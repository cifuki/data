Q:I am using espresso-contrib to perform actions on a RecyclerView, and it works as it should, ex:

onView(withId(R.id.recycler_view))
.perform(RecyclerViewActions.actionOnItemAtPosition(0, click())); //click on first item


and I need to perform assertions on it. Something like this:

onView(withId(R.id.recycler_view))
    .perform(RecyclerViewActions.actionOnItemAtPosition(0, check(matches(withText("Test Text"))));


but, because RecyclerViewActions is, of course, expecting an action, it says wrong 2nd argument type. There's no RecyclerViewAssertions on espresso-contrib.

Is there any way to perform assertions on a recycler view?

A:You should check out Danny Roa's solution Custom RecyclerView Actions
And use it like this:

onView(withRecyclerView(R.id.recycler_view)
    .atPositionOnView(1, R.id.ofElementYouWantToCheck))
    .check(matches(withText("Test text")));
