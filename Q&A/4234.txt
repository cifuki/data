Q:I have written an setOnItemSelectedListener for spinner to respond when the spinner item is changed. My requirement is when I clicks again the currently selected item, a toast should display. How to get this event? When the currently selected item is clicked again, spinner is not responding. `               

    StorageSpinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(new AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener(){

        @Override
        public void onItemSelected(AdapterView adapter, View v, int i, long lng) {              
            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), (CharSequence) StorageSpinner.getSelectedItem(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

        }

        @Override
        public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView arg0) {
            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Nothing selected", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

        }
    });

A:When you clicks again the currently selected item, then it can not fire any event. So you  can not catch setOnItemSelectedListener for spinner to respond.
