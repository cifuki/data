Q:This error occurs in setContentView line in this code snippet:

/** Called when the activity is first created. */
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);


I understand that in order for R.layout.main to be resolved, a file named res/layout/main.xml must be present.

It is present and valid (i.e. Eclipse marks it as perfect without any errors). So, what else could cause this error?

BTW, I already tried Project > Clean. The error persists.

A:Make sure you don't have this in your imports:

import android.R;


but:

import your.application.packagename.R;
