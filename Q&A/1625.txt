Q:After I have updated my Studio from 0.3.7 to 0.4.0, I can't compile my project. I found a solution on stackoverflow: Duplicate files copied (Android Studio 0.4.0)

I updated my project to gradle 0.7.+, but I don't know where I must put the next strings:

android {

    packagingOptions {
       exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
    }
}


My logcat: log

Execution failed for task ':Prog:packageDebug'.
> Duplicate files copied in APK META-INF/LICENSE.txt
    File 1: /home/scijoker/AndroidStudioProjects/ProgProject/Prog/libs/httpclient-4.1.1.jar
    File 2: /home/scijoker/AndroidStudioProjects/ProgProject/Prog/libs/httpclient-4.1.1.jar


P.S. Develop in ubuntu 13.04

A:Putting the dependecies at the top and the packageOptions at the end worked for me.

apply plugin: 'android'. 


Here is my full build.gradle at the app folder.

dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:+'
    compile files('libs/apache-mime4j-0.6.jar')
    compile files('libs/httpmime-4.0.jar')
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion 19
    buildToolsVersion "19.0.1"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 7
        targetSdkVersion 10
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            runProguard false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-    rules.txt'
    }


    packagingOptions {
        exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
        exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES'
        exclude 'META-INF/notice.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/license.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/dependencies.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/LGPL2.1'
    }
}


EDIT: Almost all OS licence include the obligation to "include a copy of the licence" into your project. So this means, that you have to include a copy of all OS licences you use into you projects. By "excluding" them in gradle, you violate the licences.

Excluding them from the project might not be the best option.
Thank you R.S. for the info.
