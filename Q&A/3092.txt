Q:I have received a Security Alert from Google this week that tells me to upgrade my android version of cordova app. The email from google is as below - 


  This is a notification that your --apps ids--, is built on a version of Apache Cordova that contains security vulnerabilities. This includes a high severity cross-application scripting (XAS) vulnerability. Under certain circumstances, vulnerable apps could be remotely exploited to steal sensitive information, such as user login credentials.
  
  You should upgrade to Apache Cordova 3.5.1 or higher as soon as possible. For more information about the vulnerabilities, and for guidance on upgrading Apache Cordova, please see http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2014/08/04/android-351.html.
  
  Please note, applications with vulnerabilities that expose users to risk of compromise may be considered \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous products\xe2\x80\x9d and subject to removal from Google Play.


So, I needed to check the current version of my cordova apps. I can upgrade my cordova installation by using npm update -g cordova on windows cmd. The question is how can I check the current platform (android in my case) version of my cordova app?

A:The current platform version of a cordova app can be checked by the following command 

cordova platform version android


And can be upgraded using the command 

cordova platform update android


You can replace android by any of your platform choice like "ios" or some else.

This only applies to android platform. I have not checked. You can try replacing android in the code segments to try for other platforms.
