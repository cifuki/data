Q:I am new to git. I have a very simple scenario for using git. I had my first release written with Android Studio. Now I want to work with some new features. What I did so far:


enabled the VCS in my Android Studio 
created a local repository for my project from Android Studio
pushed my local repository to my Bitbucket remote repository ($git push -u origin master)


Now I am confused for the next step: create a feature branch. Should I create a branch in the local repository: 

$ git branch --track feature1 origin/master 


or should I create a new branch from the Bitbucket web portal, and clone the new branch?

I also want to know how I can switch branches with Android Studio? For example, switch from feature branch to master branch to work on some hotfix. Do I need to use the Bitbucket plugin to checkout the project very time from the remote repository every time I switch branches or I can hot switch it inside Android Studio?

Thanks!

A:You should be able to do this directly from Android studio.

The easiest way is going to the bottom right corner of the Android Studio window where you should see the text "Git: branch name", in your case it should say "Git: master". Click on it and it will show a small menu consisting of the different branches available both locally and remotely, also there should be an option "+ New Branch" which will create a new branch for you and switch you to it. 

You should then be able to change some code, commit it and push it to remote. Merging and checking out branches can also be done from that same menu. The same thing can also be done from the menubar option "VCS"
