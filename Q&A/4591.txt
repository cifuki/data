Q:I tried searching on here but couldn't find the answer.

I'm looking for a way to launch the Hierarchy Viewer from within Android Studio, rather than having to launch it at the command-line. I've recently migrated to Android Studio from Eclipse, and this functionality was available under the DDMS set of tools in that IDE.

I've looked under the "Android" toolbar, and can see the screen-shot functionality there, but not the hierarchy viewer. I've also looked under Tools > Android in the menu system, and it's not there either.

A:DDMS, Hierarchy Viewer, openGL Tracer etc all moved into Android Device Monitor.  To access:


In Android Studio:  "Tools" menu > Android > Android Device Monitor
In ADM: "Window" Menu > Perspective
Click on Hierarchy Viewer.
