Q:How can I remove the application icon & title which comes by default in an action bar?

There is a similar question here: Can i hide the App Icon from the Action Bar in Honeycomb?, but it doesn't talk about how to do it?

A:Call setDisplayShowHomeEnabled() and setDisplayShowTitleEnabled() on ActionBar, which you get via a call to getActionBar().
