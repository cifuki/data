Q:I have a simple read a txt-file function.

AssetManager mngr = getAssets();
InputStream is = mngr.open("textdb.txt");


It works from my main activity. But if I use the same code in a separate class, getAssets() just return null / crash.

I am unable to find why it only works from the main class.

Any ideas?

Solution:

subClass.ReadSettings(getApplicationContext());

public String[] ReadSettings(Context myContext) {
}

A:Is your other class also an Activity?
getAssets() is a method of Context. If your class is not an activity, you'll need to pass a context into it and then call getAssets on that.

Like so:

public myClass(Context myContext) {
    AssetManager mngr = myContext.getAssets();
    InputStream is = mngr.open("textdb.txt");
}
