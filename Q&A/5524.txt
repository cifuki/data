Q:I'm developing an app on Ionic Framework/cordova, and when I try "cordova run android" I get this:


  "Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at value with
  value  @integer/google_play_services_version)"


I don't really know what is happening, I tried to set the value with a fixed value (I know is not the best solution), and the problem continues.

Thanks in advance!

A:Copy the google-play services_lib library project to your workspace OR Import the library project to your eclipse.

Click File > Import, select Android > Existing Android Code into Workspace, and browse the workspace import the library project.  

Right click on your android project. Goto properties. Choose Android on the left panel. Click on Add and browse the library project. Select the same. Click ok and apply.
