A:Solution

To see the option for USB debugging mode in Nexus 4 or Android 4.2 or higher OS, do the following:


Open up your device\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSettings\xe2\x80\x9d. This can be done by pressing the
Menu button while on your home screen and tapping \xe2\x80\x9cSystem settings\xe2\x80\x9d
Now scroll to the bottom and tap \xe2\x80\x9cAbout phone\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAbout tablet\xe2\x80\x9d.
At the \xe2\x80\x9cAbout\xe2\x80\x9d screen, scroll to the bottom and tap on \xe2\x80\x9cBuild number\xe2\x80\x9d
seven times. 


Make sure you tap seven times. If you see
a \xe2\x80\x9cNot need, you are already a developer!\xe2\x80\x9d message pop up, then you know you have
done it correctly. 



Done! By tapping on \xe2\x80\x9cBuild number\xe2\x80\x9d seven times, you have unlocked USB debugging mode on Android 4.2 and higher. You can now enable/disable it whenever you desire by going to 
\xe2\x80\x9cSettings\xe2\x80\x9d -> \xe2\x80\x9cDeveloper Options\xe2\x80\x9d -> \xe2\x80\x9cDebugging\xe2\x80\x9d ->\xe2\x80\x9d USB debugging\xe2\x80\x9d.

CONCLUSION

That was easy. The best part is you only have to do the tap-build-number-seven-times once. After you do it once, USB debugging has been unlocked and you can enable or disable at your leisure. Please restart after done these steps.
