Q:I have a RecyclerView with a bunch of custom views which may change height after a while, because they contain ImageViews which load their image asynchronously. The RecyclerView does not pick up on this layout change, although I call forceLayout on the ImageView, and the RecyclerView is initialized with setHasFixedSize(false). All container-parents of the ImageView have set android:layout_height="wrap_content".

How can I make the RecyclerView update its layout? With good'ol ListView this was not a problem.

A:You can use the notifyDataSetChanged in the Adapter for the RecyclerView if all your images change at the same time or notifyItemChanged(int position) if only one of the items has changed. This will tell the RecyclerView to rebind the particular View.
