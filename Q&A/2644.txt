Q:When trying to install a signed application (app-release.apk), a "Blocked by Play Protect" alert is shown and the app is not installed. However, an unsigned application  (app-debug.apk) can be installed without problems.

The error message: 


  Play Protect doesn't recognise this app's developer. Apps from unknown developers can sometimes be unsafe.


Why this error happened? What's the solution?
