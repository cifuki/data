Q:I got a WebView that load an HTML file with a text. The problem is that the color inside the html and outside isn't the same. Here is a screenshot:



The HTML FIle is:

<html dir="rtl">
<head>
    <title>About</title>
    <meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type"/>

    <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
        <p>This is a Testpp</p>
        <p>See the problem.</p>
         <p>last test:</p>
    </body>
</html>


(If I remove the: bgcolor="#FFFFFF" color stays the same)
Thanks!

A:The default background color for light theme is: #EEEEEE

Is almost white, but not completely.

It worked for me, hope its work for you.

UPDATE: In new versions you could be looking for #FAFAFA
