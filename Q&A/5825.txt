Q:I want to create some pre-created files when my Android application is installed.

I would like to create the file in both the internal memory (data/data//files/) and in a newly created sdcard directories (/sdcard//data1/). 

How can I do this?

A:You can save you files in \\res\\raw and write the code to store this files to the desired locations if it does not exist when the app start.
Check this to access the internal memory and sdcard
and access the raw file using the following   

InputStream databaseInputStream = getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.yourfile);
