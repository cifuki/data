Q:I have been building a project and testing it on the Android emulator. 

I realized that I set the minSdkVersion to 10. Now, I have a phone to test the program on, but its sdk version is 7. 

I tried to go into the manifest file, and change the sdk version to 7, but every time I run the program, it crashes. 

How can I rebuild or change the sdk version to a lower number (from 10 to 7), so that I can make sure my app is able to run on older phones?

A:Create a new AVD with the AVD Manager and set the Target to API Level 7. Try running your application with that AVD. Additionally, make sure that your min sdk in your Manifest file is at least set to 7.
