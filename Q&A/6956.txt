Q:I installed Android Studio 1.2.1.1 and also created virtual device. I am trying to install one app (APK file) through command line but I could not find adb.exe file on my machine. Please help where should I look for adb.exe file on the machine.

A:The adb.exe file will be located at your Android SDK folder, inside platform-tools

...\\android-sdk-path\\platform-tools\\adb.exe


The default location where Android SDK is installed is:

C:\\Users\\<insert username here>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\\


So adb will be located at:

C:\\Users\\<insert username here>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe




To access it on a command line, open cmd.exe and type:

cd C:\\Users\\<insert username here>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\\platform-tools\\


and then your normal command

adb <insert parameters here>
