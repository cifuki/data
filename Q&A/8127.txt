Q:I am using android studio to build debug and release application.
When i build debug/release application

./gradlew assembleDebug

./gradlew assembleRelease


both build are created perfectly and run as well. Shows appropriate dialog box for debug or release

now i have added proguard details in build.gradle:

signingConfigs {
    myConfig {
           storeFile file("keystore.jks")
           storePassword "abc123!"
           keyAlias "androidreleasekey"
           keyPassword "pqrs123!"
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        runProguard true
        proguardFile getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt')
        signingConfig signingConfigs.myConfig
    }
}
productFlavors {
    defaultFlavor {
        proguardFile 'proguard-rules.txt'
    }
}


Now it shows error in event log as


  Warning: there were 7 unresolved references to classes or interfaces.
           You may need to add missing library jars or update their versions.
           If your code works fine without the missing classes, you can suppress
           the warnings with '-dontwarn' options.

If i turn the runProguard option to false then its running.

I have these questions:

1) is it ok to release apk with runProguard = false?

2) How to use dontwarn while creating release build?

A:When I add new lib to project Generally this How I need to define for Progaurd.

Let's say I am using Twitter4J lib then I add dontwarn this way.


  -keep class twitter4j.** { *; }
  
  -dontwarn twitter4j.**
