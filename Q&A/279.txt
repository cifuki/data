Q:I have created a layout that contains two buttons, Next and Previous. In between the buttons I'm generating some dynamic views. So when I first launch the application I want to disable the "Previous" button since there wont be any previous views. I also want to disable the "Next" button when there are not more views to display. Is there anyway to disable the buttons?

A:Did you try this?

myButton.setEnabled(false); 


Update: Thanks to Gwen. Almost forgot that android:clickable can be set in your XML layout to determine whether a button can be clickable or not.
