Q:Many people are asking for this, no one seems to have an answer so I do neither.

How is it possible that some apps serve the function to record the audio output of the android system? Everything I am finding is the very same tutorial on 1432 different sites where you can record MIC input. I don't care about mic input, I want the audio output and just can't imagine how to access it.

If everyone can get me on the right way, I would be so happy.

A:Seems to be currently there is no way to achieve this.
I have read this article and it suggests to recompile the Android source code with some changes.

A Method to Capture Android System Audio

Anyway most of the time this is not a feasible solution.

This is another question related to this : android get device overall audio output in pcm
