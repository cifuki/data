Q:I have installed the new Android Studio. Everything was working fine but when I try to create a new project it gets stuck at downloading Gradle.

Is there any way to install the Gradle required by Android Studio manually? Or any other method to solve this problem ?

A:It is not stuck, it will take some time normally 5-7 mins , it also depends upon internet connection, so wait for some time. It will take time only for first launch. 

Update: Check the latest log file in your C:\\Users\\<User>\\.gradle\\daemon\\x.y folder to see what it's downloading.
