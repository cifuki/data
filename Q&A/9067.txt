Q:I was just wondering if there was anyway to add a Google +1 button inside my Android app.
I have seen a +1 on the Android Market so I would think there would be some way to do this.

A:With the Google+ platform for Android, you are now able to integrate a native +1 button in your Android app.

1) You first need to initialize the PlusClient object in your Activity.

2) Include the PlusOneButton in your layout:

    <com.google.android.gms.plus.PlusOneButton
        xmlns:plus="http://schemas.android.com/apk/lib/com.google.android.gms.plus"
        android:id="@+id/plus_one_button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        plus:size="standard"
        plus:annotation="inline" />


3) Assign the PlusOneButton to a member variable in your Activity.onCreate handler.

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    mPlusClient = new PlusClient(this, this, this);
    mPlusOneButton = (PlusOneButton) findViewById(R.id.plus_one_button);
}


4) Refresh the PlusOneButton's state each time the activity receives focus in your Activity.onResume handler.

protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    // Refresh the state of the +1 button each time the activity receives focus.
    mPlusOneButton.initialize(mPlusClient, URL);
}
