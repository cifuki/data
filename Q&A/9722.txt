Q:I'm getting an underline in some variables on Android Studio (in this case on the 'position' variable). I think it's not an error because the application runs perfectly and the compiler passes everything ok.
I'm wondering what does that mean?

A:I believe the underlined variables are representative of constants (final or effectively final), because in my experience I only see this decoration when I declare a final object for use inside an anonymous class. I can't seem to find it in the documentation, though.
