Q:I currently have a fragment in an overlay. This is for signing in to the service. In the phone app, each of the steps I want to show in the overlay are their own screens and activities. There are 3 parts of the sign-in process and each had their own activity that was called with startActivityForResult(). 

Now I want to do the same thing using fragments and an overlay. The overlay will show a fragment corresponding to each activity. The problem is that these fragments are hosted in an activity in the Honeycomb API. I can get the first fragment working, but then I need to startActivityForResult(), which isn't possible. Is there something along the lines of startFragmentForResult() where I can kick off a new fragment and when it's done have it return a result to the previous fragment?

A:All of the Fragments live inside Activities. Starting a Fragment for a result doesn't make much sense, because the Activity that houses it always has access to it, and vice versa. If the Fragment needs to pass on a result, it can access its Activity and set its result and finish it. In the case of swapping Fragments in a single Activity, well the Activity is still accessible by both Fragments, and all your message passing can simply go through the Activity.

Just remember that you always have communication between a Fragment and its Activity. Starting  for and finishing with a result is the mechanism for communication between Activities - The Activities can then delegate any necessary information to their Fragments.
