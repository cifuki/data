Q:After I start the emulator by hitting Debug in Eclipse, after certain time it disconnects from the ADB, but the emulator stays open. It is responsive, I can navigate and start apps.

How can I attach back the emulator to ADB, to be able to debug from Eclipse?

(the current workaround is the terminate the emulator, close Eclipse and restart both of them, which takes 10 minutes as you know the emulator needs time to start up)

EDIT 2

After I kill and restart server. One emulator process shows up in Devices tab in Eclipse. But that cannot be expanded, and I don't see sub-processes.
I can't hit debug already, as it says: Debug already running. (How to I stop the debug?)

If I managed to start the debugging of another project, It hangs out in the emulator telling me: Waiting for the debugger to attach. Nothing happens.

A:As you said, the problem is not Eclipse losing contact with the Emulator, but ADB - the Android Debug Bridge - losing contact with it.  As Eclipse uses ADB to communicate with the emulator when ADB is broken Eclipse can do nothing.

To fix this stop the ADB server by running the following command:

adb kill-server


Eclipse will then usually try to restart ADB, or you can restart it yourself by running an ADB command, such as:

adb devices


If you do, you'll see output like this:

* daemon not running. starting it now *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device


You can also do this via the mouse, using the Reset adb option in the Devices view in Eclipse.



It's also worth noting the Console view has two modes, DDMS and Android.  You're usually in Console mode but it's DDMS mode which will show ADB status messages.  Select modes by clicking the button with the Monitor icon, or using the arrow next to it:



If all else fails, try killing the adb processes from the OS.  On Windows XP I use:

TASKKILL /F /IM adb.exe
