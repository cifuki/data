Q:I've got a real doozy here.  When I click on spinners, open menu items, or open context menus on long-clicks I get the same Logcat message:

08-02 21:20:57.264: E/ViewRootImpl(31835): sendUserActionEvent() mView == null


The tag is ViewRootImpl, and the message is sendUserActionEvent() mView == null.  I could not find anything helpful about this on the web.  I searched through the Android sources and found some references to mView, but I could not find the file in which this log message is printed.  For reference, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4 running 4.2.2, or API 17.  The same message does NOT occur when debugging on a Nexus 7 running Android 4.3.  Any ideas?  Is this a Samsung-specific issue?

A:I also encuntered the same in S4. I've tested the app in Galaxy Grand , HTC , Sony Experia but got only in s4. You can ignore it as its not related to your app.
