Q:I've just tried to generate signed apk for one of my projects (I already did this before), but (maybe since updating Android Studio) I'm getting


  Error:Error: Expected resource of type string [ResourceType]


This is because I'm using Butterknife's @BindString, that is generated into something like that

target.settings = res.getString(2131230792);


How can I make studio not detect this as error? I've tried searching in settings, but without success.

A:This is reported on the GitHub project.
It will be fixed in the next version of ButterKnife.

The workaround is indicated there, and is to add a lint.xml file on the app module with the following content to ignore that errors on *$$ViewBinder classes (the ones that ButterKnife generates):

<issue id="ResourceType">
    <!-- Remove this when this is fixed: https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/issues/338 -->
    <ignore path="**/*$$ViewBinder.java" />
</issue>
