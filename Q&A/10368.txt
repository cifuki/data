Q:I see App in my Apps section of settings which says App not installed for this user. It's completely greyed out and I cannot uninstall it. When I install the same from play store it says incompatible version is already installed.

I just want to remove this App from my device.




Doesn't get uninstalled from adb either


  C:\\Users\\athakur>adb uninstall com.osfg.rintonesetter.main
  Failure [DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR]


and


  C:\\Users\\athakur>adb shell pm uninstall -k com.osfg.rintonesetter.main
  Failure [DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR]


Any suggestion is appreciated.
