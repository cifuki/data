Q:Android defines screen sizes as Normal Large XLarge etc. 

It automatically picks between static resources in appropriate folders. I need this data about the current device in my java code. The DisplayMetrics only gives information about the current device density. Nothing is available regarding screen size. 

I did find the ScreenSize enum in grep code here
However this does not seem available to me for 4.0 SDK. Is there a way to get this information?

A:Copy and paste this code into your Activity and when it is executed it will Toast the device's screen size category.

int screenSize = getResources().getConfiguration().screenLayout &
        Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_MASK;

String toastMsg;
switch(screenSize) {
    case Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_LARGE:
        toastMsg = "Large screen";
        break;
    case Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_NORMAL:
        toastMsg = "Normal screen";
        break;
    case Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_SMALL:
        toastMsg = "Small screen";
        break;
    default:
        toastMsg = "Screen size is neither large, normal or small";
}
Toast.makeText(this, toastMsg, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
