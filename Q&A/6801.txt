Q:I have a FrameLayout inside CoordinatorLayout to inflate my fragments which contain RecyclerView. The thing is, I want to display a progress bar when loading the RecyclerView, but the progress bar is always at the top of the screen under the Toolbar. I have tried various layouts, setting gravity or centerInParent but none had worked. So is there any way to achieve this?

A:android:layout_gravity="center" 


works just fine.
And remove your FrameLayout, it's redundant.
