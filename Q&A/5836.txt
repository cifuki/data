Q:I just launched the Android device monitor for the first time on OSX but it freezes and I am not able to click anywhere, it just does not respond to any mouse or keyboard input.

I think it's downloading, I have very good internet speed, but it's downloading very slowly. I tried to download a song and it downloaded 5 MB in 30 seconds, and for this case it's downloading 2 MB in 5-10 min and its size is about 540 MB, so please assist me with what should I do to download fast? Any help would be appreciated.

Is there any manual way to download and connect it to Android Studio?

Any way to make it respond to mouse clicks?

A:With android studio 3.0, you can use Device File Explorer. Tab button is right bottom side of the screen.



You can upload your file by right click - select upload.
