Q:I just installed the new Android Studio and I'm looking for a way to be able to get support for CSS and JS (autocomplete, highlighting for incorrect usages) as i would in PHPStorm and also WebStorm, both intelliJ products.

I have googled and even added it to 'File Types', but stil they just display as plain text files.

A:I have created a Github repo with CSS & JavaScript support for Android Studio. There is even a settings.jar file for easy import.  Let me know if there is anything you would like added.
