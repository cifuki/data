Q:In android, a fragment (say FragA) gets added to the backstack and another fragment (say FragB) comes to the top. Now on hitting back FragA comes to the top and the onCreateView() is called. Now I had FragA in a particular state before FragB got pushed on top of it. 

My Question is how can I restore FragA to its previous state ? Is there a way to save state (like say in a Bundle) and if so then which method should I override ?

A:In fragment guide FragmentList example you can find:

@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    outState.putInt("curChoice", mCurCheckPosition);
}


Which you can use later like this:

@Override
public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);
    if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        // Restore last state for checked position.
        mCurCheckPosition = savedInstanceState.getInt("curChoice", 0);
    }
}


I'm a beginner in Fragments but it seems like solution of your problem ;)
OnActivityCreated is invoked after fragment returns from back stack.
