Q:I am working on some reusable Android code that I would like to distribute to other developers for use within their own applications. The code has some resource dependencies (layouts, xml & png drawables) that I would like to be able to include and reference within a single package (Jar file).

Is this possible, and if so what is the best method to do this?

A:I don't have any optimistic news for you. In general you cannot distribute your own package as easily as you would expect. The main problem is the autogenerated R file. You probably make some references to it - you have your layouts and drawables. User of your library will have his own R file - containing ids for his resources, not for the ones your library provides. 
In case of drawable resources you could read them in classic way, without R file. But as far as I know you are not able to inflate layouts from external xml files.  So the ugly hack here would be to distribute your library together with all your resources, which user would have to copy to his "res" folder. To be honest, there is no good solution to your problem... sorry.
