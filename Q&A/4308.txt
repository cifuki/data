Q:I'm getting a weird push message captured by my push service:

Bundle[{CMD=RST_FULL, from=google.com/iid, android.support.content.wakelockid=1}]


Just started to happen yesterday and I can't really spot which code change is to blame for this. Has anyone seen this message before and maybe knows where is it coming from and why?

A:Your app is getting this message because it has had data restored from a backup. As the backup may have included registration tokens, this broadcast is sent telling your app to get new tokens as the backed up ones will not work.

This is intended for the new GCM APIs, and it will cause your InstanceIdListenerService implementation's onTokenRefresh() method to be called, where your app should obtain all its tokens again.

Unfortunately, if you are writing your own BroadcastReceiver, these messages will be unexpected and may cause your app to crash. The right thing to do is to filter on the "from" field, and if you see one of these messages, to register again with GCM as your tokens may be invalid.

If you are getting these messages outside the situation of a fresh install where your app's data is being restored, please post to the android-gcm mailing list.
