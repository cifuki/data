Q:I'm trying to get a small sound file to play automatically using an  tag and javascript to initiate it.

<audio id="denied" preload="auto" controls="false">
    <source src="sound/denied.wav" />
 </audio>


And then through javascript, at the appropriate time:

$('#denied')[0].play()


Works fine on Chrome on my desktop. In Android 4.1.1, the sound will not play, unless I hit "play" on the HTML5 audio controls before javascript attempts to play it.

So basically the Android browser (stock or Dolphin) will not play the audio unless the user initiates it at some point before the javascript. Is this intended? Is there any way around this?

A:In my case this was an easy solution:

Copy & paste this in your chrome:

chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy


My web app has many page reload so I can't force the user to press a button every time; but it is for internal usage, so I can force the users to use chrome and configure that option.
