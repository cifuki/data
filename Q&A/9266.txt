Q:This question is no longer valid. But answers may still be useful for others, so I will leave it here.



Original question:

In a blogpost from 17 november, Google guys introduced long awaited granular dependency management (to cope with dex method limit). We have december 8th and I still cannot download the sdk (6.1 is the latest available), nor get the documentation on how to introduce granular dependency. Any news on this one? Or an idea how to get it before it's officialy released?

A:Note!

I will no longer be maintaining this answer, because Google is doing a very good job at doing the releases now. With a post on their Android Developers Blog, official release notes and often also a video on their YouTube channel with a short overview of what's new.

I'll leave the last two (as of writing) updates and the original answer. Please find the previous updates here

Original answer

They have just been released (see the highlights). You can find more information on how to use the granular dependencies here.

You will need to update your local Google Play Services repository using the SDK Manager provided by the SDK or use a plugin like Jake Whartons sdk-manager-plugin for Gradle which will automatically update it for you. It would look like this when building with Gradle:

Google Play Services repository outdated. Downloading update...

Edit 1

As of writing, the second link seem to be corrupt, as in, even though Using Android Studio is selected in the drop down menu, it doesn't show the information, at least for me. In order to see the information for Android Studio, select Using something else, then select Using Android Studio again.

Edit 3

Google just made a blog post about Google Play Services 6.5 and the 65k method limit. It contains the information of my post and more. I'll just quote one paragraph for anyone who comes across this information via SO instead of the blog post:


  Note: At the time of writing, the correct version to use is 6.5.87. As this is a very granular number, it will get updated quite quickly, so be sure the check the latest version when you are coding. Often people will use a \xe2\x80\x98+\xe2\x80\x99 to denote versions, such as 6.5.+ to use the latest 6.5 build. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s typically discouraged to use a \xe2\x80\x98+\xe2\x80\x99 as it can lead to inconsistencies.
