Q:I have seen some Apps and Websites who use Data from the Android Play store. E.g. Apps or Sites with a top Apps ranking etc. But how can you get the Data? From where I can parse it?

A:There's an unofficial open-source API for the Android Market you may try to use to get the information you need. Hope this helps.
