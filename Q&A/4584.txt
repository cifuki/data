Q:Here is my values\\strings.xml (the default file) and everything is self explanatory:


My question(s):


How can it be "not found in default locale" if I am editing the default locale (values\\strings.xml)?
How can it be a lint translation error if I set translatable="false"? In the values-pl\\strings.xml (and values-ru, values-iw folders as well) the strings don't exist even? it shouldn't anyway.
I can't seem to understand why I don't get the error for the Russian string.


(I would show the values-ru\\string.xml or values-pl\\string.xml here but there is nothing there of interest, since the strings are missing anyway...)

A:this happened to me too 

I do 2 things:


Verify entire file to see another translate not done ( I have ones in file en but in pt-br)
Clean, update gradle and quit and restart the Android Studio
