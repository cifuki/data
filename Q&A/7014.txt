Q:Can I run Android Studio and Android SDK emulator in a Microsoft hyper-v virtual machine? Please read carefully. 

I already use Hyper-V a lot for other purposes. Now I need to develop a app for Android. 

I've installed a new virtual machine (windows 10) and installed Android Studio. I cannot run the android emulator because it's lacking the 'intel HAXM software'. 

I read a lot about that it's not possible to install Hyper-V NEXT to Android Studio, but non of the post actually say anything about installing in a Hyper-V machine.

A:Refer to this link: 
How to run Android Studio on Windows without disabling Hyper-V

The solution (if you do not want to disable Hyper-V) is to use Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Android emulator, which is a free download here.

In order to use this with Android Studio, you need to run the emulator first. Then, in Android Studio, go to Run > Edit Configurations... and select Show Device Chooser Dialog under Deployment Target Options.

Run your project, and select the VS Emulator, ignoring the invitation to \xe2\x80\x9cTurn off Hyper-V\xe2\x80\x9d.
