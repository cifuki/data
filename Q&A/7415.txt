Q:i'm getting one issue in android app, I am trying to check already existing app, the app contains 

 implementation('com.squareup.picasso:picasso:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT') {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support'
    }


picasso library and 

using that library in a class, here is the code 

import com.squareup.picasso.Picasso;

    Picasso.with().load(url).placeholder(R.drawable.default_pic).into(imageView);


here is the error, Error:(49, 20) error: cannot find symbol method with()

and my android studio version is 3.0 RC1, is this is an issue ?

A:It looks like in the latest Picasso Snapshot that you are using the method with hast been renamed to get see related commit here: https://github.com/square/picasso/commit/e7e919232fe2b15772a7fcd9e15ead2304c66fae

so replace with() with get() and should work.

Since you are using a not yet officially released version, there are no release notes yet, and surprizes like that can happen ;-)

BTW: It seems to be a good name change to me, since a method named "with" but without parameter was a bit weird :-P
