Q:Samsung Galaxy S3 has an extrenal SD card slot, which is mounted to /mnt/extSdCard.

My question is: how to get this path by something like Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()? This will return mnt/sdcard, and I can't find API for external SD card. (Or removable USB storage on some tablets)

Thank you!

A:I have a variation on a solution I found here

public static HashSet<String> getExternalMounts() {
    final HashSet<String> out = new HashSet<String>();
    String reg = "(?i).*vold.*(vfat|ntfs|exfat|fat32|ext3|ext4).*rw.*";
    String s = "";
    try {
        final Process process = new ProcessBuilder().command("mount")
                .redirectErrorStream(true).start();
        process.waitFor();
        final InputStream is = process.getInputStream();
        final byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        while (is.read(buffer) != -1) {
            s = s + new String(buffer);
        }
        is.close();
    } catch (final Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    // parse output
    final String[] lines = s.split("\
");
    for (String line : lines) {
        if (!line.toLowerCase(Locale.US).contains("asec")) {
            if (line.matches(reg)) {
                String[] parts = line.split(" ");
                for (String part : parts) {
                    if (part.startsWith("/"))
                        if (!part.toLowerCase(Locale.US).contains("vold"))
                            out.add(part);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return out;
}


The original method was tested and worked with


Huawei X3 (stock)
Galaxy S2 (stock)
Galaxy S3 (stock)


I'm not certain which android version these were on when they were tested.

I've tested my modified version with


Moto Xoom 4.1.2 (stock)
Galaxy Nexus (cyanogenmod 10) using an otg cable
HTC Incredible (cyanogenmod 7.2) this returned both the internal and external. This device is kinda an oddball in that its internal largely goes unused as getExternalStorage() returns a path to the sdcard instead.


and some single storage devices that use an sdcard as their main storage


HTC G1 (cyanogenmod 6.1)
HTC G1 (stock)
HTC Vision/G2 (stock)


Excepting the Incredible all these devices only returned their removable storage. There are probably some extra checks I should be doing, but this is at least a bit better than any solution I've found thus far.
