Q:Is it possible to change the orientation of the genymotion emulator?
Is there a shotcut or setting to change this?

I've tried to google it but have not find it.
Any suggestion would be appreciated,thank you.

A:Two ways :


Button in the sidebar
CTRL + F11


Edit : 
And if it does not work, it's surely because the application in foreground is orientation locked.
