Q:I am trying to integrate a Google plus Login in my application as per the instruction provided by following link :
https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/android#install-sdk

I am following all the instructions perfectly.  And when I run the sample application on a real device provided in the android-sdk and click the signin button, it display a Toast message that An internal error occurred

What am I doing wrong?

A:This can happen when you haven't set the signature for the client ID in your API console project, or if you copied the wrong key value from keytool.  Doing so is documented in the steps of the quick start guide on steps 7, 8, 9, and 10.
