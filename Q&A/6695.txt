A:Create an implementation of OnCameraChangeListener, and pass an instance of it to setOnCameraChangeListener() of your GoogleMap. Your listener should be called with onCameraChange() whenever the user changes the zoom, center, or tilt. You find out the new zoom level from the CameraPosition object that you are passed.
