Q:I would like to implement a ExpandableListView which should be expandable only after all the values have been set up within the adapter. Also I would like to be able to disable the collapsing of the expander. 

Can I achieve this within an Android XML Layout?

A:You can define a OnGroupClickListener which returns true, like so:

expandableList.setOnGroupClickListener(new OnGroupClickListener() {
  @Override
  public boolean onGroupClick(ExpandableListView parent, View v,
                              int groupPosition, long id) { 
    return true; // This way the expander cannot be collapsed
  }
});
