Q:I'm trying to tint an image prior to Android API level 21. I've successfully tinted items using:

<android:tint="@color/red"/>


However, I can't seem to figure out how to do this through code on an ImageView:

Drawable iconDrawable = this.mContext.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.somedrawable);
DrawableCompat.setTint(iconDrawable, this.mContext.getResources().getColor(R.color.red));
imageView.setImageDrawable(iconDrawable);


I've tried setting the TintMode but this seems to make no different. Am I using the v4 compatibility class DrawableCompat incorrectly?

A:The simplest way to tint cross-platform (if you don't need a ColorStateList) is:

drawable.mutate().setColorFilter(color, PorterDuff.Mode.SRC_IN);


Don't forget to mutate the Drawable before applying the filter.
