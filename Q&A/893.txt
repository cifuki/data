Q:I have recently started to use Android Studio v0.1.1, And i can't seem to find LogCat... Is it gone? Or if not, how can I enable it?

If it is gone, is there any way to enable something similar to log my app behavior (and mainly crashes)?

A:I think I still can find logcat in my installation of 0.1.1

Try pressing Alt+6 on Windows or CMD+6 on Mac.
