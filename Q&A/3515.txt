  The connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occured  




I am currently trying to develop an application for Android in the latest release of Eclipse. When I try to build and run, the following comes up: 

[2011-02-17 17:08:03 - <ProgramName>] The connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occured.
[2011-02-17 17:08:03 - <ProgramName>] You must restart adb and Eclipse.
[2011-02-17 17:08:03 - <ProgramName>] Please ensure that adb is correctly located at 'C:\\<sdk-directory>s\\platform-tools\\adb.exe' and can be executed.


Now, I have updated the ADT plugin, I have the latest version of the Android SDK; adb.exe is, in fact, in the platform-tools directory and can be executed. I've tried everything I found on Google:


I tried adb kill-server and adb start-server
I tried to run it with an without an emulator started
I have the given directory in my PATH (I tried with just the platform-tools in the path and I tried with having both platform-tools and tools in my PATH).


Notes: I am running Windows 7. Also, I have previously tested apps in Eclipse. This error is new to me since upgrading the SDK.

A:I just got the same problem and to fix it, I opened the task manager and killed the adb.exe process, then I restarted Eclipse.
