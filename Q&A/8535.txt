Q:I have a Fragment that contains an Edit Text. When the Edit Text is pressed, the keyboard is being shown. When pressed the Save button in the upper corner, the application returns to the previous fragment, but the keyboard persists.

I would like the keyboard to be hidden when navigating to the previous fragment. 

Please, note that I tried this solution:
Close/hide the Android Soft Keyboard.

InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager)getActivity().getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(myView.getWindowToken(), 0);


I tried to use this in both fragments, in the onCreate method. 

I also tried to hide the soft keyboard in the layout: 

android:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysHidden"


None of these worked, unfortunately. 

I would have posted some pictures, but I do not have enough reputation yet. 
I would appreciate any constructive help and opinion and do not forget that "A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer." :)

Regards, 
Alexandra

A:Put the code that hides the keyboard in your "save button" click listener, and use this method to hide the keyboard:

    public static void hideKeyboard(Activity activity) {
        InputMethodManager inputManager = (InputMethodManager) activity
        .getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);

        // check if no view has focus:
         View currentFocusedView = activity.getCurrentFocus();
         if (currentFocusedView != null) {
             inputManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(currentFocusedView.getWindowToken(), InputMethodManager.HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS);
         }
     }
