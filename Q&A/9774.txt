Q:I was trying to create a file to save pictures from camera, it turns out that I can't create the file.
But I really can't find the mistake. Can you have a look at it and give me some advice?

private File createImageFile(){
        File imageFile=null;
        String stamp=new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd_HHmmss").format(new Date());
        File dir= Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);
        String imageFileName="JPEG_"+stamp+"_";
        try {
            imageFile=File.createTempFile(imageFileName,".jpg",dir);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.d("YJW",e.getMessage());
        }
        return  imageFile;
    }


And I have add the permission.

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>


The method always give such mistakes:


  open failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory)

A:The Pictures directory might not exist yet. It's not guaranteed to be there.

In the API documentation for getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(), the code ensures the directory exists using mkdirs:

File path = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(
        Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);
File file = new File(path, "DemoPicture.jpg");

try {
    // Make sure the Pictures directory exists.
    path.mkdirs(); 


...so it may be as simple as adding that path.mkdirs() to your existing code before you createTempFile.
