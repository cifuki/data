Q:I searched it on Stackoverflow but regarding flutter, I do not find any relevant solution, here and here  may be the same question but they are not for flutter.

I'm using JSON file and register in Pubspec.ymal but showing error and also when I use an image and register it, the same error also occurs. Maybe there is a formatting mistake in it, but I don't know what is the problem with it.this is the documentation I followed.


  Error on line 29, column 5 of pubspec.yaml: Expected a key while parsing a block mapping.
  assets:
      ^


This is my pubspec.yaml file

name: jsondata description: A new Flutter application.

  dependencies:  

  flutter:

  sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

  dev_dependencies:   

 flutter_test:

      sdk: flutter

    flutter:

    uses-material-design: true

      assets:

       - loadjson/person.json

A:Spaces are significant in YAML

assets is indented too far

flutter_test:
  sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
