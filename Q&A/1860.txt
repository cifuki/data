Q:I am using RecyclerView with GridLayoutManager and I have each item as CardView.

Unfortunately, the CardView here does not seem to change its background color. I tried in layout and programmatically as well but I have tried nothing seems to work.

I Have been struggling for quite a while. I appreciate if someone could help me out with this issue.

A:If you want to change the card background color, use: 

app:cardBackgroundColor="@somecolor"


like this:

<android.support.v7.widget.CardView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:cardBackgroundColor="@color/white">

</android.support.v7.widget.CardView>


Edit:
As pointed by @imposible, you need to include 

xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"


in your root XML tag in order to make this snippet function
