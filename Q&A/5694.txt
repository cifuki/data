Q:I would like to retrieve the incoming call's phonenumber and do something with it like the do
in http://blog.whitepages.com/2009/02/27/caller-id-by-whitepages-a-new-android-app-that-puts-telemarketers-on-alert/

Could you please help me because I can't find any information about this.
Where do i start and how do i get hold of the phonenumber?



Ok so currently my code looks like below. When I place the call the CustomBroadcastReceiver catches it and the log message is printed out. I can retrieve the telephone number from the bundle. But! I can't get hte CustomPhoneStateListener to work. As you can see I have registered my customPhoneState listener to the receiver but the log message never get's printed out from the CustomPhoneStateListener class. What am I my missing here?
Is my thinking correct? 



<receiver android:name=".CustomBroadcastReceiver">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE" /> 
        </intent-filter>
</receiver>

</application>
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="5" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />




public class CustomPhoneStateListener extends PhoneStateListener {

private static final String TAG = "CustomPhoneStateListener";

public void onCallStateChange(int state, String incomingNumber){

    Log.v(TAG, "WE ARE INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!");
    Log.v(TAG, incomingNumber);

    switch(state){
        case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_RINGING:
            Log.d(TAG, "RINGING");
            break;
    }   
}




public class CustomBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

private static final String TAG = "CustomBroadcastReceiver";

@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.v(TAG, "WE ARE INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!");
    TelephonyManager telephony = (TelephonyManager)context.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
    CustomPhoneStateListener customPhoneListener = new CustomPhoneStateListener();

    telephony.listen(customPhoneListener, PhoneStateListener.LISTEN_CALL_STATE);


    Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
    String phoneNr= bundle.getString("incoming_number");
    Log.v(TAG, "phoneNr: "+phoneNr);

}

A:Use PhoneStateListener. It has an onCallStateChanged handler; one of the supplied arguments you'll get is a String containing the incoming phone number.
