Q:I have created a custom view named Graphview . Here is the structure for the GraphView class.

public class GraphView extends View {

    public GraphView(Context context, float[] values, String title, String[] horlabels, String[] verlabels, boolean type) {
        super(context);
                ........
   }

   ..................
   .................
}


I have added the view in a tablerow using addview(). It is working fine. Now I want to set height and width for the GraphView. How to do that?

A:The easy way is to set the size programatically like that :

graphView.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(width, height));


This is fine if you know the exact size of the view. However, if you want a more flexible approach, you can override the onMeasure() method to measure the view more precisely depending on the space available and layout constraints (wrap_content, match_parent, or a fixed size).

You can find an example on how to override onMeasure() by looking at the android docs and the LabelView sample in your SDK directory.
