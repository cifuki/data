Q:I have a little problem compiling an android application using module dependencies in Android Studio.

So, I want my application to use the library 'slidingmenu' (link here).

Here is my application tree:


Application
slidingmenu (source files)
slidingmenu-maps-support (source files)


Here is a link to see what I mean.

This is the error I'm getting.


  Gradle: A problem occurred configuring project ':Application'.
  
  Failed to notify project evaluation listener.
  
  Configuration with name 'default' not found.


How do I specify a module dependency and where do I put the modules (inside Application or inside ApplicationProject?

Thanks!

EDIT 1:
Never mind! I got back to eclipse! Android Studio is just not ready for a true project development.

A:You should put your library modules inside the Application Project. In order to specify a module dependency, simply:


Right click on Application->Open Module Settings
Click on the '+' icon
Select the root directory for your library module you'd like to add.
Follow the prompts


Then, this module will show up in your project. Then, you need to add it to Application as a library dependency. Once again, in your Module Settings:


Select your Application module
Select the Dependencies tab on the right
Click the '+' icon on the bottom
Select Module Dependency
Select your desired library module
