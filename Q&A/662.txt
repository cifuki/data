Q:I have a TextView in my application. I want to align the text in it to the right. I tried adding:

android:gravity="right"


But this doesn't work for me.

What might I be doing wrong?

A:I think that you are doing this: android:layout_width = "wrap_content"
If this is the case, do this: android:layout_width = "match_parent"
