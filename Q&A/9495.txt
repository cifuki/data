Q:I cannot find how to change fragment's textview from an Activity. I have 4 files :

MainActivity.java
activity_main.xml
FragmentClass.java
frag_class.xml


frag_class.xml has textView, I want to change the text from MainActivity.java.
FragmentClass extends Fragment, this fragment is displayed in MainActivity
FragmentClass has:

public void changeText(String text){
 TextView t = (TextView) this.getView().findViewById(R.id.tView);
 t.setText(text);
}


and in MainActivity I tried this:

FragmentClass fc = new FragmentClass();
fc.changeText("some text");


But sadly this code gives me NullPointerException at fc.changeText("some text");
I've also tried changing the text directly from MainActivity with:

 TextView t = (TextView) this.getView().findViewById(R.id.tView);
 t.setText(text);


which Failed.

[EDIT]
The full code is here

A:@Lalit answer is correct but I see that you dont need to create a function like fragment_obj.updateTextView();. I set all my view as class level objects and was able to update the textview directly.

fragmentRegister.textViewLanguage.setText("hello mister how do you do");


Note: If you need to perform more than one action then having a function is the way to go.
