Q:My android project builds fine with lombok 1.16.0, but once I change my dependency to target 1.16.2, I get the following error everywhere I'm using a lombok annotation: 

Error:(20, 1) error: package javax.annotation does not exist

The Android SDK does not include all javax packages. What I'm wondering is if this is a bug in 1.16.2 or do I now have to add a dependency to javax.annotation?

Note: This is in Android Studio with Lombok plugin 0.8.8

A:You can disable the generation of javax.annotation.Generated by putting the following line in a lombok.config file in one of the top directories of your project:

lombok.addGeneratedAnnotation = false


See the configuration documentation for more information.
