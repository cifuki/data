A:Following Answer I am giving on the based on my personal experience.


First Suggestion ( Internal/Phone Memory )

When you are storing database in Internal Memory, then for the Performance it is very good. Because your Application will be installed in the Internal Memory, so while inserting 1000 Records and other record ,for the application it would be more easier to access the database. Application's performance will be very nice. But when it comes to Memory limitations, when Internal Memory will get filled more than enough then your device's performance will be down. So Internal Memory is best till medium level database.
Second Suggestion ( External Memory, SD Card )

When you are storing database in external Memory like SD Card, then for performance , application performance\xe2\x80\x99s will be bit slower than Internal Memory. However this won't be significant for medium level database. When there is very few data then performance will be same in both the  cases. Now when you are using External Memory, then you have large size of data storing. I do not think it will never get filled fully . But in case of large number of records performance will be down. Sometimes it may be possible that application crashes.
