Q:How can I determine whether a headset is plugged into an Android device or not?

A:When you say "headset", do you mean "wired headset"? If so, there's an intent to detect whether or not one is being plugged or unplugged: ACTION_HEADSET_PLUG.

To check the status, you can use AudioManager.isWiredHeadsetOn(), although that may return false if there is also a bluetooth headset, and audio is routed to that instead.
