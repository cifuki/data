Q:I'm debugging my Android application using the AVD (Android Virtual Device).  When I try to enter text in a text field, my characters are being interpreted as Chinese in the IME.

I don't know how I got into this mode or how to get out of it (I just want to enter alphabetic keys)?

Here's a screen shot:

A:If you were running monkey at some point, it probably changed the input method — it happens quite often.

You can change the input method by long-pressing on an input field and choosing Input Method → Android Keyboard.  I think you can also long-press on the bottom-left key on the virtual keyboard.

Note you can also disable the Japanese and other input methods from being activated entirely via Settings → Keyboard → untick the box next to each IME.
