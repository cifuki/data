Q:Is there a way for an Android user to browse the SQLite databases on his/her phone and view the data in the databases?

I use the SoftTrace beta program a lot. It's great but has no way that I can find to download the data it tracks to a PC.

A:The database for a specific app lives in /data/data/[packagename]/databases

The packagename is the package you define in your manifest, for instance /data/data/org.vimtips.supacount/databases/counts.db.

You can view it with adb shell and type sqlite3 /data/data/org.vimtips.supacount/databases/counts.db

Or you can pull it from the device to look at it with a third party utility, with a command like adb pull /data/data/org.vimtips.supacount/databases/counts.db ..

This assumes you have permission to view the database, which you might not have if you didn't write the app yourself... but in that case, is it actually a programming question?
