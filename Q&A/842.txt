Q:I am working on a cross-platform React Native mobile app. I am writing console.log statements as I develop. I want to see these logging statements in Chrome while I'm running the Android app in the default Android emulator. According to Facebook's docs I just need to "shake the device". How do I do this in the Android emulator?


  To access the in-app developer menu:
  
  On iOS shake the device or press control + \xe2\x8c\x98 + z in the simulator.
  On Android shake the device or press hardware menu button (available on older >devices and in most of the emulators, e.g. in genymotion you can press \xe2\x8c\x98 + m to >simulate hardware menu button click)
