A:For Android Studio projects you can do the following:

If you need to change net speed temporarily, then on an emulator toolbar, click three dots (settings), go to Cellular tab and configure the network speed there. You need to have a recent Android Tools.

If you want to set this speed permanently for some emulator image:


Open menu Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager
Select/create your emulator avd image, click Edit
Click Show Advanced Settings button
Set the desired net speed
Re-launch the emulator


OLD ANSWER (obsolete)

If you are working in Eclipse, go to Run->Run Configurations, select your run configuration and then go to "Target" Tab. There you will find a "Network Speed" combobox (under the "Emulator Launch Parameters" section).

If you are running emulator from command line, then you can use "-netspeed" cmd line parameter (run emulator -help-netspeed for overview of possible options)
