Q:In Eclipse I can run an emulator without HAXM but when I want to run the emulator without HAXM in Android Studio, I get an error.

Can I run the emulator without HAXM in Android Studio for  a device not supporting it?
And how?

A:The Android emulator is independent from Android Studio and Eclipse. 

HAXM is Intel's virtualization extension for Android Emulator on x86. You can use an emulator with the ARM image instead of HAXM provided that you installed it in the SDK manager.  

Check your SDK manager to see if you have an ARM image instead for the API level you want,  then go to the AVD manager and make a virtual device using ARM as the cpu.
