Q:Wherever I look, FrameLayout seems to be used as the FragmentContainer.
Why is FrameLayout always seen with Fragments?

A:You can basically use RelativeLayout or LinearLayout it will still work,but the answer of your question is in FrameLayout's documentation :


  FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display
  a single item. Generally, FrameLayout should be used to hold a single
  child view, because it can be difficult to organize child views in a
  way that's scalable to different screen sizes without the children
  overlapping each other. You can, however, add multiple children to a
  FrameLayout and control their position within the FrameLayout by
  assigning gravity to each child, using the android:layout_gravity
  attribute.
