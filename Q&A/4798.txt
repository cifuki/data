Q:My application has a Fragment inside its Activity. I would like to programmatically replace the fragment by another one from the current fragment itself.

For example, if I click on a button inside the fragment, the fragment should be replaced with another one, but the activity should remain the same.

Is it possible? If so, how to do it?

A:It's actually easy to call the activity to replace the fragment.

You need to cast getActivity():

((MyActivity) getActivity())


Then you can call methods from MyActivity, for example:

((MyActivity) getActivity()).replaceFragments(Object... params);


Of course, this assumes you have a replaceFragments() method in your activity that handles the fragment replace process.

Edit: @ismailarilik added the possible code of replaceFragments in this code with the first comment below which was written by @silva96:

The code of replaceFragments could be:

public void replaceFragments(Class fragmentClass) {
    Fragment fragment = null;
    try {
        fragment = (Fragment) fragmentClass.newInstance();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    // Insert the fragment by replacing any existing fragment
    FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
    fragmentManager.beginTransaction().replace(R.id.flContent, fragment)
            .commit();
}
