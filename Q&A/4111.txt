Q:Recently, I upgraded Android Studio from version 1.5 to 2.0 but since then I observe that the number of errors and warnings has increased. Most of the errors do not make sense. Can someone please help:

A:You can get rid of the meaningless warnings and errors by deleting the .idea folder that Android Studio 1.5 created and importing the the project into Android Studio 2.0 as a gradle project.  It will recreate the .idea folder automatically.
