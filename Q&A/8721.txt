Q:I am new to fingerprint authentication in smartphones. As we know Samsung S5 currently supports fingerprint scanner. Is it possible to develop a custom application that can use the scanner to authenticate a user? I just need to know the identity of the user and if he has been authenticated correctly. My app can then take it from there and integrate with backend.

A:Google has now announced a generic fingerprint API for Android that can be utilised by any custom apps for authorisation and not just the native Google apps. It looks like the future is just getting brighter!

Taken from the Android Developers page linked below:

"To authenticate users via fingerprint scan, get an instance of the new FingerprintManager class and call the authenticate() method."

However you must also include this permission:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />
