Q:I want to use the marquee effect on a TextView, but the text is only being scrolled when the TextView gets focus. That's a problem, because in my case, it can't.

I am using:

  android:ellipsize="marquee"
  android:marqueeRepeatLimit="marquee_forever"


Is there a way to have the TextView always scroll its text? I've seen this being done in the Android Market app, where the app name will scroll in the title bar, even if it doesn't receive focus, but I couldn't find this being mentioned in the API docs.

A:I have been facing the problem and the shortest solution I have come up with is to create a new class derived from TextView.
The class should override three methods onFocusChanged, onWindowFocusChanged and isFocused to make the TextView all focused.

@Override
protected void onFocusChanged(boolean focused, int direction, Rect previouslyFocusedRect) {
    if(focused)
        super.onFocusChanged(focused, direction, previouslyFocusedRect);
}

@Override
public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean focused) {
    if(focused)
        super.onWindowFocusChanged(focused);
}


@Override
public boolean isFocused() {
    return true;
}
