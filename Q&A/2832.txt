Q:I've noticed Android Studio (when running) uses greater than 100% CPU at all times, even when it appears there are no background processes that the IDE is running (indexing, etc). I might suspect this were something specific to my box, but some fellow developers are encountering this as well.

Often times the CPU usage is in the high 100s or mid 200s (see screenshots below). Has anyone encountered this as well? If so, are there any strategies or options within the IDE to correct this intensive use of system resources?

A:You can try the following options in the File Menu: 


File Menu -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart
Enable Power Save Mode by clicking on File -> Power Save Mode


Power Save mode only disable code insights and background tasks.
