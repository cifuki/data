Q:So right now in my app the URL I'm accessing has a redirect, and when this happens the WebView will open a new browser, instead of staying in my app. Is there a way I can change the settings so the View will redirect to the URL like normal, but stay in my app instead of opening a new browser?

Edit:

I want the redirecting URL, I just don't know how to create it, so the only way to get to that URL is through one that will cause a redirect to the one I want. 

For example: When you go here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/s/ref=is_box_/k=9780735622777 notice how it will redirect the URL to the actual product. In my app, if I open it in a new browser, it will do that just fine, however if I keep it in my app with a WebView, it will show up as though it's doing a search for k=9780735622777, like this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/s/ref=is_s_?k=k%3D9780735622777&x=0&y=0 . OR, it will open the view in the browser and show what is appropriate. However, I want to keep everything in my app.

A:Create a WebViewClient, and override the shouldOverrideUrlLoading method.

webview.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
        // do your handling codes here, which url is the requested url
        // probably you need to open that url rather than redirect:
        view.loadUrl(url);
        return false; // then it is not handled by default action
   }
});
