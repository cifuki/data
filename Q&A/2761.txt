Q:While testing my apps, I use emulators and my own phone to see if everything is working ok.  My apps are also writing data to shared preferences and a text file.

I can pull the data from my emulators through the DDMS in eclipse so I can read the data files on my computer, but when I try to open those folders through the DDMS on my phone, nothing happens.  I click the data folder and nothing happens.

My phone is rooted.  Is there any way I could pull the files from my phone?  I know that Android keeps these folders private, but there must be a way.  The emulator is just way too slow.

A:On rooted device you can do this:


Open cmd
Type adb shell
su
Press 'Allow' on device
chmod 777 /data /data/data /data/data/com.application.package/data/data/com.application.package/*
Go to the DDMS view in Eclipse


After this you should be able to browse the files on the device.

To get the databases:


chmod 777 /data/data/com.application.package/databases /data/data/com.application.package/databases/*




If it returns permission denied on su 

Go to Settings > Developer Options > Root access > Apps and ADB
