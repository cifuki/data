Q:I know from this question and answer on Super User Site running on localhost on desktop is unreachable on android device (PS: this question continues on the question in the link) that the command ng serve opens a bad configured webserver.

The question is how could I run my site on an Android device without deploying my site. I'll try to run the site on this url http://192.168.0.168:4200 using Angular-CLI.

A:try ng serve --host option as explained in this issue: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/1793  comment by intellix.


ng serve --host 0.0.0.0
Find your local ip address by following this
Navigate to <local ip adress>:4200 from any device on the same network.


otherwise try https://ngrok.com/ to open a tunnel from your local network to your computers localhost. Basically your computer forwards the 4200 port to an external ip and port that any device on the network can access.
