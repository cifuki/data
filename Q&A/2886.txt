Q:In my app I have a logout functionality. If user clicks logout it goes to home screen. Now I am  exiting my app by pressing back button. But what I want is I need to exit automatically(i.e Programmatically) as same like as back button functionality. I know by calling finish() will do the functionality. But the thing is it goes to the previous activity.

A:onBackPressed() is supported since: API Level 5   

@Override
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    if ((keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK)) {
        onBackPressed();
    }
}

@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    //this is only needed if you have specific things
    //that you want to do when the user presses the back button.
    /* your specific things...*/
    super.onBackPressed();   
}
