A:same problem happened to me, From this

I have faced the same issue, to solve it:

1- delete (or move) the projects folder (AndroidStudioProjects).

2- Run the Android-Studio (a WELCOME screen will started).

3- From Welcome Screen choose, "Configure -> Project Defaults -> Project Structure)

4- Under Platform Settings choose SDKs.

5- Select Android SDK -> right_click delete.

6- Right_click -> New Sdk -> Android SDK -> choose your SDK dir -> then OK.

7- Choose the Build target -> apply -> OK. enjoy
