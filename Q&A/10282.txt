Q:May I know what the differences between getInstalledApplications and getInstalledPackages? The documentation doesn't say much.

A:PackageManager.getInstalledApplications(int flags) will provide you information regarding the AndroidManifest's Application tag, and just about it. Forget about activities, receivers, services and go on.
PackageManager.getInstalledPackages(int flags), on the other hand, will provide you information regarding all AndroidManifest's elements, such as declared activities, services, receivers, meta-data


Both methods will provide info regarding whatever application, regardless they have or they have not declared an android.intent.category.LAUNCHER intent category in some activity.

In addition, both methods will retrieve one PackageInfo/ApplicationInfo per APK, or being more specific, for package name.
