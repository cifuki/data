Q:I am getting the following error when I compile my app:

[2014-05-07 21:48:42 - Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: Cannot merge new index 65536 into a non-jumbo instruction!


I am at the point that if I declare a new method anywhere in my package, I get this error. If I don't, the app compiles.

I would like to know what exactly (and accurately) does this error mean. My app is big, but I don't think its that big! So:


Does the error mean I have too many methods? public? static? package? members?
Is it related to the methods/members of my root package, or also to the included JAR libraries?
Is there a way to get more debug information about this?


I already know about that "jumbo" enabling flag addressed in the similar questions here in SO, however, I think jumbo mode is not available on the API level I'm targeting (ICS).

A:It's related to the number of methods of libraries included in the project. For example if you have tracking in your app, just Google Analytics is ~7000 methods.
In one of my projects using Lombok (2MB of JAR) gave me these problem. Solved getting rid of this library.
