Q:I am trying to develop for android and I want to add the adb to my PATH so that I can launch it really easily. I have added directories before by for some reason adb does not want to be found. This is very frustrating. Has anyone else had this problem before?

I created a file .profile and added the following to it.

export PATH = ${PATH}:/Users/simon/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools/
export PATH = ${PATH}:/Users/simon/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools


When I check my environment path I see the following:

/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools:/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools


So I know that it is added to my PATH variable. Now when I try to run adb I get that it is not found. 

-bash: ./adb: No such file or directory


This is very very frustrating. Could it be a problem with permissions? Has anyone had this problem with OSX and Android?

A:Why are you trying to run "./adb"? That skips the path variable entirely and only looks for "adb" in the current directory. Try running "adb" instead.

Edit: your path looks wrong. You say you get

/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools:/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools


You're missing the /Users/simon part.

Also note that if you have both .profile and .bash_profile files, only the latter gets executed.
