Q:I want to know if it is possible to run Xamarin on Ubuntu. I don't like java, so I want to make Android apps with C#.

Is a package for Ubuntu, because I haven't seen one so far?

Or...

Can I run Xamarin on Ubuntu using Wine?

Or...

Is there an alternative software (with the same capabilities) that runs on Ubuntu?

A:Xamarin has stated on several different occasions that they have no plans to support Xamarin Studio on Linux in the short term.
The main reasons are: 


They would have to create a self-contained Mono runtime to go along with the IDE, since different flavors of Linux would ship with different Mono support
The cost to support many versions of Linux would outweigh the benefits
Lack of commercial demand to pay for support
