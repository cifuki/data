Q:I am implementing a kiosk mode application and i have successfully made the application full-screen without status bar appearance post 4.3 but unable to hide status bar in 4.3 and 4.4 as status-bar appears when we swipe down at the top of the screen.

I have tried to make it full screen by


speciflying the full screen theme in manifest
setting window Flags ie setFlags
setSystemUiVisibility


Possible duplicate but no concrete solution found

A:We could not prevent the status appearing in full screen mode in kitkat devices, so made a hack which still suits the requirement ie block the status bar from expanding.

For that to work, the app was not made full screen. We put a overlay over status bar and consumed all input events. It prevented the status from expanding.

note:


customViewGroup is custom class which extends any
layout(frame,relative layout etc) and consumes touch event. 
to consume touch event override the onInterceptTouchEvent method of
the view group and return true

customViewGroup implementation

Code :

WindowManager manager = ((WindowManager) getApplicationContext()
            .getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE));

WindowManager.LayoutParams localLayoutParams = new WindowManager.LayoutParams();
localLayoutParams.type = WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_ERROR;
localLayoutParams.gravity = Gravity.TOP;
localLayoutParams.flags = WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE|

            // this is to enable the notification to recieve touch events
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL |

            // Draws over status bar
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_LAYOUT_IN_SCREEN;

    localLayoutParams.width = WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT;
    localLayoutParams.height = (int) (50 * getResources()
            .getDisplayMetrics().scaledDensity);
    localLayoutParams.format = PixelFormat.TRANSPARENT;

    customViewGroup view = new customViewGroup(this);

    manager.addView(view, localLayoutParams);
