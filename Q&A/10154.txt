Q:I've started getting a 

DEBUG/skia(xxxx): --- decoder->decode returned false 


issue on a few profile images from Facebook that I use in ImageViews.  Most work perfectly, but every once in a while I discover one that never works.

I am compiling my application against Android 1.6 for backward compatibility reasons.

I did some digging and discovered a number of threads on the issue.  I'm already using the FlushedInputStream discussed here: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6066

Bitmap b = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(new FlushedInputStream(is));
imageView.setImageBitmap(b);


Here's an example that's causing me trouble:
http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/hs269.snc3/23132_639284607_390_q.jpg

Can someone check out the image and help me figure out what's causing the trouble?

A:There is a bug in FlushedInputStream(is). it fails on slow connections but you can try my magical code to fix it.

Bitmap b = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(new FlushedInputStream(is));
imageView.setImageBitmap(b);


create a static class outside your method

 static class FlushedInputStream extends FilterInputStream {
        public FlushedInputStream(InputStream inputStream) {
            super(inputStream);
        }

        @Override
        public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
            long totalBytesSkipped = 0L;
            while (totalBytesSkipped < n) {
                long bytesSkipped = in.skip(n - totalBytesSkipped);
                if (bytesSkipped == 0L) {
                    int b = read();
                    if (b < 0) {
                        break;  // we reached EOF
                    } else {
                        bytesSkipped = 1; // we read one byte
                    }
                }
                totalBytesSkipped += bytesSkipped;
            }
            return totalBytesSkipped;
        }
    }


and here you go.. now you will not have any problem.
