Q:I have created a Git Repository on bitbucket. The repository is empty now. I have an Eclipse project, in my system, that I want to push(using Eclipse - EGit) into the repository I created. How do I do it?

I have no knowledge of doing this by command line, so, please, give me the details for doing this by using the GUI of Eclipse. Any links that might help, also are appreciated.

A:First, make sure you already installed EGit or other git control plugins on your Eclipse.
Second, add Git Source Control to your existing Android Eclipse Project (local) and create a local Git Repository for the Project, by following the steps below:  (or check this video)


  
  right click your project -> Team -> share project
  check the option of "Use or create repository in parent folder of project"
  select your project
  click the button of "create repository"
  hit "finish"
  right click your project -> Team -> Add to Index
  right click your project -> Team -> commit
  

Then push your Project (now is under local Git Source Control) to a Remote Repository such as GitHub.com or BitBucket.org, by following the steps below:  (or check this video)


  
  right click your project -> Team -> remote -> push
  type in the URL of the remote repository you are using
  type in username and password, then hit "next"
  click the button of "Add All Branches Spec"
  click "next"
  click "finish"
