Q:I am using Android's VIBRATOR_SERVICE to give a haptic feedback for a button touch.

 ((Vibrator) getSystemService(VIBRATOR_SERVICE)).vibrate(300);


Android Studio give me warning that method vibrate(interval) is deprecated I should use VibrationEffect for API>23. 

So I usedVibrationEffect's method createOneShot which takes 2 params: interval, and amplitude. 


I tried searching for it but got no clue about what to pass as amplitude, anybody got any idea about how to use it?

Update Added code

// Vibrate for 150 milliseconds
private void shakeItBaby() {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 26) {
        ((Vibrator) getSystemService(VIBRATOR_SERVICE)).vibrate(VibrationEffect.createOneShot(150,10));
    } else {
        ((Vibrator) getSystemService(VIBRATOR_SERVICE)).vibrate(150);
    }
}

A:Amplitude is an int value. Its The strength of the vibration. This must be a value between 1 and 255, or DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE which is -1.

You can use it as VibrationEffect.DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE
