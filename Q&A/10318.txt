Q:What are the minimal steps necessary (including retrieving the source code) to compile and run just the Dalvik virtual machine on Linux?

A:Dalvik runs on Android. The authors of Dalvik are only worrying about it running on Android, as far as we are aware.

Various groups have indicated they are working on getting Dalvik outside of Android. You are probably best off finding and talking to them.

In other words, there are no official instructions of the type you seek.

Sorry!
