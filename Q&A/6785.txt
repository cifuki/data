Q:I just recently downloaded the Android SDK. Downloading all the packages in the SDK Manager will take way too much time. So I'm wondering whether I should deselect all the platforms except the latest one. Or do I need all the platforms?
Thanks in advance.

A:Not at all. You just need to install those platforms which you are targeting for your apps and which you intend to test your app with. If I were you, I'd install:


API 24 (Multiple app windows, Notification enhancements, Multi-locale support)
API 23 (Runtime permissions toggling, Doze mode and BoringSSL)
API 21 (Massive changes, including Material Design)
API 19 (Many changes to various API methods)
API 18 (New features such as BLE, new API methods)
API 14 (Big overhaul - addressed several issues in Honeycomb)
API 11 (Quantum shift - native Fragments & Action Bar from API 11 onwards)
API 10 (Last of the "old" Android platforms - there are still people using this)


You should also install


SDK Tools 24.0.2
SDK Platform-tools 21
SDK Build-tools 21.1.2
Google Play Services SDK
Google USB Driver


Optional:


Offline documentation for each SDK Platform.
Platform source code - useful for a look under the covers.
