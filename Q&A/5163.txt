Q:Now on Android Studio 2.2 on new Preview mode, there are no more refresh button:




Image 1: Preview on Android Studio 2.2 (without refresh button)
Image 2: Preview on Android Studio 2.1 (with refresh button)



  Does anyone know how to display it again? Or with shortcut maybe?


Edit: If I change a drawable by example and that the change does not appear in the layout, the only method that works for me is closed and restart the project. If I close the layout and as I re-opens nothing happens. Same result using the "Synchronized" button.

A:Refresh feature is not removed, it is there; it's pretty simple to refresh:

Click on the preview screen to make sure preview window has the focus and press R. it should display the progress in the right-top corner while refreshing.

If it doesn't work for any reason,  switch to design tab and press R, it refreshes the layout instantly.
