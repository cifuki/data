A:To Completely Remove Android Studio from Windows:

Step 1: Run the Android Studio uninstaller

The first step is to run the uninstaller. Open the Control Panel and under Programs, select Uninstall a Program. After that, click on "Android Studio" and press Uninstall. If you have multiple versions, uninstall them as well.

Step 2: Remove the Android Studio files

To delete any remains of Android Studio setting files, in File Explorer, go to your user folder (%USERPROFILE%), and delete .android, .AndroidStudio and any analogous directories with versions on the end, i.e. .AndroidStudio1.2, as well as .gradle and .m2 if they exist.

Then go to %APPDATA% and delete the JetBrains directory.

Finally, go to C:\\Program Files and delete the Android directory.

Step 3: Remove SDK

To delete any remains of the SDK, go to %LOCALAPPDATA% and delete the Android directory.

Step 4: Delete Android Studio projects

Android Studio creates projects in a folder %USERPROFILE%\\AndroidStudioProjects, which you may want to delete.
