Q:After having imported an Eclipse project into Android Studio, I see two build.gradle files:

1 - <PROJECT_ROOT>\\build.gradle
2 - <PROJECT_ROOT>\\app\\build.gradle


The first version is shorter, the second version contains definitions for compileSdkVersion, etc.

What is the purpose behind having two separate files?  Are there separate build tasks?

A:<PROJECT_ROOT>\\app\\build.gradle is specific for app module.

<PROJECT_ROOT>\\build.gradle is a "Top-level build file" where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

If you use another module in your project, as a local library you would have another build.gradle file:
<PROJECT_ROOT>\\module\\build.gradle

For example in your top level file you can specify these common properties:

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.0'
    }
}

ext {
    compileSdkVersion = 23
    buildToolsVersion = "23.0.1"
}


In your app\\build.gradle

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion
    buildToolsVersion rootProject.ext.buildToolsVersion
}
