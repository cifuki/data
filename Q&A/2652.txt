Q:Having the source code attached to external libraries is awesome. Where do I find the source code for the v4 support package? Preferably, it would be a zip file which could be easily attached to the android-support-v4.jar in Eclipse.

A:After downloading the support package from the Android SDK Manager, you can find the source code of support package in folder <android-sdks>/extras/android/support/v4/src.
