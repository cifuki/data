A:edit

See comments below as to why, especially on different API versions (esp later ones), this isn't a foolproof way to see if you're list is at the top (padding etc). However, it does give you a start for a solution on devices below API 14: 

private boolean listIsAtTop()   {   
    if(listView.getChildCount() == 0) return true;
    return listView.getChildAt(0).getTop() == 0;
}


As far as my implementation years ago - this worked perfectly at the time.
