Q:I am looking for the source code of the android lock screen. It can be for any version of Android (1.5, 1.6, 2.0, etc).

I tried looking in the repository at: https://android.googlesource.com/, but it doesn't look like it's under platform/frameworks/base. Maybe it's closed source?

A:Do an actual full checkout of the source according to Google's directions.

As of Android 4.2, the keyguard source is at frameworks/base/policy/src/com/android/internal/policy/impl/keyguard. There's a mirror on GitHub you can look at online (I pegged this link to the JB MR 1.1 release in case the location changes again in a future release).

When this question was originally answered, Android 2.3 and lower had their lockscreen source at frameworks/policies/base/phone/com/android/internal/policy/impl.
You can also view these sources online in their GitHub mirror; that source is still kicking in the current repo, but hasn't been updated in several years.
