I have a List<Thing> and I would like to pass it to a method declared doIt(final Thing... things).  Is there a way to do that?

The code looks something like this:

public doIt(final Thing... things)
{
    // things get done here
}

List<Thing> things = /* initialized with all my things */;

doIt(things);


That code obviously doesn't work because doIt() takes Thing not List<Thing>. 

Is there a way to pass in a List as the varargs?

This is in an Android App, but I don't see why the solution will not apply to anything Java

A:Just pass things.toArray(new Thing[things.size()]).
