A:Taken from: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units:


  The em is simply the font size. In an element with a 2in font, 1em
  thus means 2in. Expressing sizes, such as margins and paddings, in em
  means they are related to the font size, and if the user has a big
  font (e.g., on a big screen) or a small font (e.g., on a handheld
  device), the sizes will be in proportion. Declarations such as
  'text-indent: 1.5em' and 'margin: 1em' are extremely common in CSS.


em is basically CSS property for font sizes.
