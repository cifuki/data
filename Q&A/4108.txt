Q:I'm about to build an Android application that will use a RESTful Web Service. I don't want to write the REST client by myself, as I want it to be as effective and stable as possible (this is the first time I'm using REST).

Are there any (free) frameworks or utilities avaibale for Android/Java that I can use in my project?

A:Restlet is an excellent REST framework and has an Android edition.
