Q:I know this question has been asked before and I have seen a plethora of solutions out there, yet none seem to work for me.  I was able to build my apk without issues until this error started cropping up.  I have tried cleaning my project, removing it from the workspace and reimporting it, removing "Java Builder" from my Builders for the project, building the project manually, reordering my java build path.  I have no visible compiler issues and no problems exist in my workspace.  

I did experience this issue before and solved it once by removing the project form my workspace and re-importing it and another time I solved it by removing "Java Builder" from my java build path.  None seem to work this time.  I currently have most of the settings set back to default (i.e. java build is checked again).

I am running windows 7 (64 bit) and using jdk1.6.0_21 via Eclipse 3.6.  

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I have lost loads of development time troubleshooting this already.

[Update] My locale is English & I have tried removing the debug.keystore, United States as related to issue 834

A:Please follow these steps; this might help you out:


Right-click your app project and go to Properties
Select Android from left-hand side list
Uncheck the "Is Library" checkbox


If your app project relies on library projects which are in your workspace, those of course need to have the "Is Library" box checked.
