Q:What unit of measure does Paint.setStrokeWidth() use and do I need to scale this value based on the current screen density?

It's a float value so I know it's not a number of pixels. It must be relative to something.

This is all the documentation says as of this writing:


  Set the width for stroking. Pass 0 to stroke in hairline mode. Hairlines always draws a single pixel independent of the canva's matrix.

A:The stroke width is defined in pixels (yes it's a float, and there's no problem with using fractions of pixels :)
