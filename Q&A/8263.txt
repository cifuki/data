Q:I have a Navigator in an Android react native application.

I'm using navigator.push() to navigate to a different page. It would seem natural that the back button would pop the navigator and to go back one page, but that's not what's happening (it quits the app).

Do the react-native Navigator really has no back button support, do I need to plug it myself with a BackAndroid?

A:Yes, you have to handle the back button yourself. I think the main reason for this is you may want to do different things with the back button instead of just moving back through the stack. I don't know if there are plans to incorporate back button functionality in the future though.
