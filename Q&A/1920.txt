Q:I am working on a project which have some charts (graphs), tick chart, candlestick chart and range chart. But the problem is, there is no library for that charts. I have got Google chart API for candlestick chart. But I don't want graph/chart in a webview.

Example: Android Candlestick Chart with Google Chart API
