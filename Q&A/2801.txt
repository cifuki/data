Q:I just changed the background of a ToggleButton, and now I'm looking to change the ON/OFF text that comes up with it.  What is the easiest way to do this?

A:You can use the following to set the text from the code:

toggleButton.setText(textOff);
// Sets the text for when the button is first created.

toggleButton.setTextOff(textOff);
// Sets the text for when the button is not in the checked state.

toggleButton.setTextOn(textOn);
// Sets the text for when the button is in the checked state.


To set the text using xml, use the following:

android:textOff="The text for the button when it is not checked."
android:textOn="The text for the button when it is checked."
