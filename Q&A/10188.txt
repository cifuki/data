Q:Can multi-touch events be tested on the Android Emulator? Or is there any way to test this without an actual device? I am using the 2.0 sdk and want to test zoom-in/zoom-out with two fingers.

A:UPDATE: 

Yes, now there is (not for the 2.x Android, but the latest ones).


  In case people still searching with this function, if you are using
  default emulator from android studio, for mac user you can hold
  command button, and for windows/linux i believe it is alt button while
  left clicking with your mouse \xe2\x80\x93 HendraWD


And for Linux, it's Ctrl + left click (however, I don't know if it's the same on Windows, so HendraWD may be right about that one)

Plus another thing you can do (with Android 4.0+) is pipe touch events through one device into the emulator. This is helpful if you only have one device, but would like to test those same touch events on other versions/dimensions of Android. (See http://tools.android.com/tips/hardware-emulation)

In any case, these are just workarounds, if multitouch is important for your app, I would still recommend that you go to an Android Developer user group with your laptop and ask for help to test your app on the spot. Your fellow developers can be super helpful with this. 

In my groups, we share phones all the time (especially since most of us don't own all the different Android handsets out there). And if you don't have an Android user group in your area, assuming you live in a large enough metropolitan area, consider possibly starting such a group yourself. You're most likely not the only one who will need help with this stuff.
