Q:Is there a way to change the name (Launcher App Label) of an app without creating a new project?

Note: Name of the App and The label shown on the Launcher Icon on Home Screen on Mobiles can be different.

Example: On the home page in my Mobile where my apps are, I have an icon and the name Foo, but I want to change the name to Bar. Can I do this?

A:Yes you can. By changing the android:label field in your application node in AndroidManifest.xml.

Note: If you have added a Splash Screen and added 

<intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
</intent-filter>


to your Splash Screen, then the Launcher Icon name will be changed to the name of your Splash Screen Class name.

Please make sure that you change label:

android:label="@string/title_activity_splash_screen"


in your Splash Screen activity in your strings.xml file. It can be found in Res -> Values -> strings.xml
