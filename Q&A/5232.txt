Q:So, I'll be getting my T-Mobile G1 within a month or so, and I'm excited to start developing for it.

Has anyone started using it yet? Is there a dev wiki or anything set up for it yet?

A:Google's android groups 


This is probably the best place to go. However, a good search on google will most likely take you to one of these discussion anyways. Here, you can discuss about your difficulties possibly with the core developers too.


Anddev.org 


They're probably the most active groups so far (as of Sun, April 20, 2008) online regarding the development and the interactive community around android. Apart from the official google groups and the irc channel at #android on irc.freenode.net, they're probably the best place to go or ask questions.

Development halted here but still some rather interesting things that have been done.


phandroid.com


Didn't see much development things


Androforge.net


A nice little repository, not a lot of files though.

I pulled it from my development wiki which hasn't been updated for a while but best of luck working with Android ... and T-Mobile G1
