Q:With each SDK, I have a solution of installing MIPS system image. 

What is it? What does it do and when will someone use it? What will happen if I do not install it?

A:What is it?


It is an emulator image that emulates a device that has a MIPS CPU, instead of an ARM or x86 CPU.


  What does it do and when will someone use it?


You will use it if you wish to emulate a device that has a MIPS CPU, instead of an ARM or x86 CPU.


  What will happen if I do not install it?


You will not be able to emulate a device that has a MIPS CPU, instead of an ARM or x86 CPU. The MIPS Consortium may cry. But, considering right now there are very few Android devices with MIPS CPUs on the market, not having a MIPS emulator is probably just fine.
