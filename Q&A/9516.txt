Q:I want to replicate the transitions as explained in Material design by Google.
This is the link for the preview, but basically the videos I care about are those two:


http://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/videos/animations-meaningfultransitions-hierarchical_transitions_topLevel_large_xhdpi.webm
http://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/videos/animation-meaningfultransitions-view_contact_large_xhdpi.webm


My question is what is the container of the UI? Is this a new Activity which onCreate has animations for each element or is it a fragment? 

In particular on the second example there is some movement on the 1st Activity so inside the  onClick is there an animation which also creates a 2nd activity? (note that the clicked name also moves, so this should not be a new activity)

In other words what the layout (+Activities, fragments) should be if I want to replicate this?

A:Maybe too late but I have found support library contains ActivityOptionsCompat: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/package-summary.html
It contains activity animations like scale up animations. Hope this helps.
