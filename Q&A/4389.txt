Q:So, seeing that the new Android L is out, I said I should give it a try. I installed the new ADT update from SDK tools and then from the updates. After Eclipse restart, I get the error that Android Dependencies failed to load because \\android-sdk\\tools\\support\\annotations.jar cannot be found. 

I checked the folder and it does not have the file.

Well, I said to myself that maybe the ADT update didn't go well so seeing that the new eclipse 4.4 is out I thought I could do a fresh install. So downloaded eclipse 4.4, installed the ADT tools and android sdk... and I get the same error.

Any ideas on how to fix this ?

  Please wait for an updated version within a day or two. Until then,
  your workaround is to do download one of:
  
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-linux.tgz
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-windows.zip
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zip
  
  
  and copy over the following files:
  
  
  tools/hprof-conv
  tools/support/annotations.jar
  tools/proguard
