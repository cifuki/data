Q:I need to move data from one table to another in my Android app

I would like  to use the following sql:

insert into MYTABLE2 select id, STATUS risposta, DATETIME('now') data_ins from  MYTABLE 2


Unfortunately in table MYTABLE2  there is an _ID column AUTOINCREMENT.
What could I do?

Thanks.

EDIT: 
this is my MYTABLE2 the, the table I would like to populate with data from another table:

CREATE TABLE "ANSWERS" ("_id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  AUTOINCREMENT  NOT NULL ,
"ID_QUESTION" INTEGER,"DATE_INS" DATETIME DEFAULT 
(CURRENT_DATE) , "ANSWER" INTEGER)

A:explicitly specify the column name in the INSERT clause,

INSERT INTO destinationTable (risposta, data_ins)
SELECT STATUS risposta, DATETIME('now') data_ins 
FROM   sourceTable
