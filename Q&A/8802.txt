Q:In Android 2.2 (Level 7) the function PowerManager.IsScreenOn() returns a boolean that is true if the screen is turned on and false if the screen is turned off. I am developing code for Android 1.5 (Level 3). How do I accomplish the same task in older versions of Android?

I do not want to turn the screen on or off in my code. I just want to know what it is.

A:You can accomplish this by setting up broadcast receivers for ACTION_SCREEN_ON and ACTION_SCREEN_OFF.
