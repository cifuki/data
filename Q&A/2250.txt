Q:What's the difference between Activity.runOnUiThread and View.post, could someone, please, explain?

A:There is no real difference, except that the View.post is helpful when you don't have a direct access to the activity.

In both cases, if not on UI thread, Handler#post(Runnable) will be called behind the scenes.

As CommonsWare mentioned in the comment, there is a difference between the two - when called on Ui thread, Activity#runOnUiThread will call the run method directly, while View#post will post the runnable on the queue (e.g. call the Handler#post)

The important point IMO is that both have the same goal, and for whoever use it, there should be no difference (and the implementation may change in the future).
