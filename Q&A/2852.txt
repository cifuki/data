A:you can use ALTER TABLE function on your onUpgrade() method, like this:

@Override
public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
  // If you need to add a column
  if (newVersion > oldVersion) {
     db.execSQL("ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN new_column INTEGER DEFAULT 0");
  }
}


Obviously, the SQLite will differ depending on the column definition.
