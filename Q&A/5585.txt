A:Problem solved!

It's happened because I call LayoutInflater.inflate([subViewOfViewPager], [ParentOfViewPager])

it should be:

LayoutInflater.inflate([subViewOfViewPager], [ParentOfViewPager], false))

More words:

It's happened because when called inflate with second parameter, view inserting as subchild of given ViewGroup, and then I try add this View to ViewPager. View can have only one Parent ViewGroup element. The third parameter sets attachToRoot to false to avoid this.
