Q:Is there a function like the "open declaration" in eclipse, that we can use in the new Android Studio?

Just like F3 button.

A:Here are more details to help you avoid asking the same question for all the other commands:

Press Ctrl + Shift + A, and search for the command you're looking for ("declaration") for example. This finds the command "Declaration - Goto by Reference action - Ctrl + B".

So you just need to put your cursor on the method you want to go to, and press Ctrl + B? You can also Ctrl + Click to achieve the same goal.

The most useful keyboard shortcuts are described in the Help - Tip of the day dialog box. Read them all.
