Q:I need to show an image by using the file name only, not from the resource id.

ImageView imgView = new ImageView(this);
imgView.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.img1);


I have the image img1 in the drawable folder. I wish to show that image from the file. 

How can I do this?

A:Labeeb is right about why you need to set image using path if your resources are already laying inside the resource folder ,

This kind of path is needed only when your images are stored in SD-Card .

And try the below code to set Bitmap images from a file stored inside a SD-Card .

File imgFile = new  File("/sdcard/Images/test_image.jpg");

if(imgFile.exists()){

    Bitmap myBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imgFile.getAbsolutePath());

    ImageView myImage = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imageviewTest);

    myImage.setImageBitmap(myBitmap);

}


And include this permission in the manifest file:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
