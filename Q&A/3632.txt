Q:I currently have a SearchView in the action bar of my app. When I click the search icon, the SearchView expands and the keyboard pops up as expected. Clicking the "X" in the SearchView box closes the SearchView as expected. However, when the SearchView is activated and I press the "back" button, my app is exited. This is the correct behavior, but what I am trying to do now is to capture back button press and just have it close the SearchView (not my app) when the SearchView is visible. Is there a way to invoke the SearchView OnCloseListener() programmatically on a back button press? For example, something like this:

// On a back button press, if we are currently searching,
// close the SearchView. Otherwise, invoke normal back button
// behavior.
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
   if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK) {
        if (isSearchViewVisible) {
            SearchView searchView = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.searchBox)
               .getActionView();

            // This method does not exist
            searchView.invokeClose();
            return true;
        }
    }
    return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
}

A:Based on @MarcinOrlowski answer, also you can use:

@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    if (!searchView.isIconified()) {
        searchView.setIconified(true);
    } else {
        super.onBackPressed();
    }
}
