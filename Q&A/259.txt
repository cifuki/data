Q:This is probably a pretty easy to answer question, but I can't find the solution myself after a couple hours of searching the documentation and Google. I set the orientation of my Android app to landscape in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

android:screenOrientation="landscape"


However, when I run the app in the simulator, it appears sideways and in portrait mode. How can I switch the emulator to landscape mode on a mac? It's running the 1.6 SDK.

A:Try:


ctrl+fn+F11 on Mac to change the landscape to portrait and vice versa.   
left-ctrl+F11on Windows 7.
ctrl+F11on Linux.


For Mac users, you only need to use the fn key if the setting "Use all F1, F2 etc. keys as function keys" (under System Preferences -> Keyboard) is checked.


left-ctrl+F11on Windows 7 
It works fine in Windows 7 for android emulator to change the landscape orientation to portrait and vice versa.
