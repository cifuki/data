Q:Dianne Hackborn mentioned in a couple threads that you can detect when a layout as been resized, for example, when the soft keyboard opens or closes. Such a thread is this one... http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/d318901586313204/2b2c2c7d4bb04e1b

However, I didn't understand her answer: "By your view hierarchy being resized with all of the corresponding layout traversal and callbacks."

Does anyone have a further description or some examples of how to detect this?  Which callbacks can I link into in order to detect this?

Thanks
