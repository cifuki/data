Q:I am seeing this error when I try to run "gradle build"

WARNING: Dependency org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.2.3 is ignored for the default configuration as it may be conflicting with the internal version provided by Android.
         In case of problem, please repackage with jarjar to change the class packages

/home/xrdawson/Projects/Foo/Bar/src/main/java/com/Foo/app/PixActivity.java:20: error: package org.apache.http.entity.mime does not exist
import org.apache.http.entity.mime.HttpMultipartMode;
                              ^


The end of my build.gradle looks like this:

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies { 
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
        compile "org.eclipse.mylyn.github:org.eclipse.egit.github.core:2.1.3"
        compile "com.madgag:markdownj-core:0.4.1"
//      compile "org.apache.httpcomponents:com.springsource.org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient:4.2.1"
        compile 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.2.3'
        compile "com.google.android:support-v4:r6"
    } 
}


Why is the compile process ignoring HttpClient, but then failing to compile?

A:I think the httpclient library doesn't include the mime parts, those are in httpmime. This is a transitive dependency of httpclient, but as that is ignored, it won't be taken into account.

Try adding this dependency:

compile "org.apache.httpcomponents:httpmime:4.2.3"
