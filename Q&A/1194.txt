Q:I keep seeing this message and not sure how to solve it for good.

Error:(43, 9) Attribute application@icon value=(@drawable/new_app_icon) from AndroidManifest.xml:43:9
    is also present at com.github.erizet.signala:signala-longpolling:0.20:7:18 value=(@drawable/ic_launcher)
    Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:icon"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:40:5 to override
:OpenBook:processDebugManifest FAILED
Error:Execution failed for task ':OpenBook:processDebugManifest'.
> Manifest merger failed with multiple errors, see logs


Tried adding android:replace="android:icon" to my manifest even with my icon.

I tried deleting the  android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher from the library but it keeps coming back when i build because its imported from maven

Any ideas ?

A:It seems to be the fault of the mainfest Merger tool for gradle.

http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/manifest-merger

Solved it by adding to my manifest tag xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"

Then added tools:replace="android:icon,android:theme" to the application tag

This tells the merger to use my manifest icon and theme and not of other libraries 

Hope it helps thanks
