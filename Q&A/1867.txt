Q:I want to read the text from a text file.  In the code below, an exception occurs (that means it goes to the catch block).  I put the text file in the application folder.  Where should I put this text file (mani.txt) in order to read it correctly?

    try
    {
        InputStream instream = openFileInput("E:\\\\test\\\\src\\\\com\\\\test\\\\mani.txt"); 
        if (instream != null)
        {
            InputStreamReader inputreader = new InputStreamReader(instream); 
            BufferedReader buffreader = new BufferedReader(inputreader); 
            String line,line1 = "";
            try
            {
                while ((line = buffreader.readLine()) != null)
                    line1+=line;
            }catch (Exception e) 
            {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
         }
    }
    catch (Exception e) 
    {
        String error="";
        error=e.getMessage();
    }

A:Try this :

I assume your text file is on sd card

    //Find the directory for the SD Card using the API
//*Don't* hardcode "/sdcard"
File sdcard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();

//Get the text file
File file = new File(sdcard,"file.txt");

//Read text from file
StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

try {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
    String line;

    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        text.append(line);
        text.append('\
');
    }
    br.close();
}
catch (IOException e) {
    //You'll need to add proper error handling here
}

//Find the view by its id
TextView tv = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.text_view);

//Set the text
tv.setText(text.toString());
