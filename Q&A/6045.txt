Q:In have a Motorola Xoom tablet and I would like to use it to develop some small Html / Css / JavaScript / jQuery applications. **Does anyone know a good IDE to do web development on Android?

I only need the IDE for: html, css, jQuery / JavaScript (other languages would be cool though).

Clarification: The development takes place on the tablet, so the IDE must run on the tablet. I would like to do some JSFiddle-like stuff when I'm travelling by train, that's why I need a offline editor.

A:You could use the online IDE. It's the Mozilla project that started out as Bespin a few years ago.

I've been playing with it for a while, and I am quite impressed with how well it works. And it hooks right into github.

There are even ways of running it in offline mode.
