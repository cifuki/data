Q:I want to pass a new, but different, Intent to an Activity. How do you differentiate between the new Intent and previous Intents? What kind of code goes into onNewIntent()? An example will be very helpful.

A:The new intent comes as part of onNewIntent(Intent). The original Intent is still available via getIntent().

You put whatever code you need to into onNewIntent in order to update the UI with the new parameters; probably similar to what you're doing in onCreate.

Also, you probably want to call setIntent(intent) in onNewIntent to make sure future calls to getIntent() within the Activity lifecycle get the most recent Intent data.
