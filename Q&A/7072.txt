Q:I have a device of which I don't know if it has a vibrator.

Is there a way to query for the availability of the vibrator?

A:The Vibrator class does just that. It's hasVibrator() method returns a boolean indicating if vibrating is supported.


Get an instance of the Vibrator class which is a system service.
Query the Vibrator class using the hasVibrator() method.


String vs = Context.VIBRATOR_SERVICE;
Vibrator mVibrator = (Vibrator)getSystemService(vs);

boolean isVibrator = mVibrator.hasVibrator();
