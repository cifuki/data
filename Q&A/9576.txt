Q:I used to change AppCompat status bar color with actionBarStyle, and creating a style with a background which is the color I want.

Now, with Material Design AppCompat, this method doesn't work anymore.

Can you help me? Thanks.

A:There's a new attribute called colorPrimary which you can define in your Theme. This will give you ActionBar or Toolbar a solid color.  

Following a little example:

<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light">
    <!-- colorPrimary is used for the default action bar background -->
    <item name="colorPrimary">@color/my_action_bar_color</item>
</style>


Please note: It has to be only colorPrimary, not android:colorPrimary, in every values-folder except the values-v21 one.

You can read more about customizing the Color Palette on developer.android.com.
