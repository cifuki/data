Q:I am using eclipse and I created a test android project and the package in the "gen" folder that contains R.java is currently called com.something.test (I thought I was just testing but build my whole app on it!)

This is referenced when loading the app and the phone sometimes displays it so I need to rename it.  I tried this by clicking refactor but it regenerated it again with the old name!

Can I rename it?

A:Right click your project, then Android Tools -> Rename Application Name:



Or, if you want to do it manually, go to your manifest file, change the package name, and make a Project Clean.
