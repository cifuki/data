Q:I have followed the Local Service example provided by Google, but my Context::bindService(...) always returns false and there is ServiceConnection::onServiceConnected is also never called.

I understand that Context::bindService() returns immediately, but my ServiceConnection object is never triggered.

I don't know if these apply


My activity is running inside a tabHost and I was wondering if that can affect service binding in any way.
The Service itself may have a problem, but I can call start service to the same service with the same Intent and it works as expected.


Does anyone have experience with this? Please help me out.

Thanks,
P.S. I am targeting Android 1.6

A:So I finally figured it out. It turns out that TabSpec cannot bind to activities


  Using getApplicationContext().bindService instead of just bindService on your
  activity solves the problem as it is using the higher level application context.


Hope this helps someone!
