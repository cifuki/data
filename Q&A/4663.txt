Q:I've created some composie UIs in my android apps and there are some ListView controls -among other controls- inside a view. Because of this, I have used "Activity" as my activity base class. 

Now I need to display a simple message like "No Item" when the ListView that is bound to my adapter is empty. I know this is possible when using ListActivity but I'm not sure what's the best approach for this?

A:You're looking for the empty view of a ListActivity:

ListActivity

If you're using ListView you can use the method setEmptyView():

setEmptyView
