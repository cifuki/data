Q:I download the latest Android Studio 2.0 from Android Develop Website.

But when I change a line of code and use the "instant run", instead of updating the changes, it prompt me "no changes to deploy".

This will happen on code changes and XML changes.

But when I restart Android Studio, things will works fine for once or twice and then "no changes to deploy" Come again!

I used my old SDK on Android Studio older version.
JDK is 1.7.0
Windows7 64

So, is anyone has this same bug?

A:A lot of people are having this issue as Instant Run is still quite buggy. The best thing to do would be to disable Instant Run entirely by Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Instant Run > Enable Instant Run
