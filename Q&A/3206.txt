Q:This tutorial uses a SimpleAdapter which works fine, but I need to update the arrays in the adapter when new data is entered.

Could you please guide me on how to update a ListView using something other than a SimpleAdapter?

A:Use a ArrayAdapter backed by an ArrayList. To change the data, just update the data in the list and call adapter.notifyDataSetChanged().
