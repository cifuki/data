Q:I'm on Eclipse for hours now and I didn't found a solution yet for my problem even after many searches on internet: I have no more R.java file on my projects.

On just created or on my old projects, i don't have R file anymore and I tried so many solutions (uninstall, re-install Eclipse, clean my project, check all my XMLs, fix problem with android tool and so on ...)

Please someone can tell me what to do in this case?

A:Hey If you just updated to ADT Rev 22 :


I had the problem too. There is a new component in the Tools folder called "Android SDK Build-tools" that needs to be installed. 

Step 1

Open the Android SDK Manager

Step 2

Select the newly added Build Tools and install. (If problem stays then go to Project Properties => Java Build Path => Order and Export and check Android Private Libraries, then clean and build project.

It may be necessary to repeat the process, restart the SDK Manager after the update and make sure it looks like this (all tools installed):
