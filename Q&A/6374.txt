Q:We all know how easily and safely to create a new Activity. Now I want to know how to remove an Activity from my project safely.

I've created some activity in my project and feel that they are now needless and I want to delete them. But if I delete manually these files:


The activity's XML file in the /layout folder
The activity's Java file in the /src folder
The <activity></activity> portion from the manifest file


Then,


Will no other data related that activity stays in my project? What are those?
Is there any simple removal procedure like creating an activity in Eclipse?

A:I found my answer. To remove an activity, let the name of the activity is activity:


Remove the activity.java file from src folder (java/your.package.name folder for AndroidStudio)
Remove the activity.xml file from layouts folder (layout folder for AndroidStudio)
Remove the activity.xml file from res/menu folder (this is an optional folder)
Remove the <activity></activity> block of the activity from the manifest file
If the <activity> block in the manifest file has a reference (usually in android:label tag) remove the referenced value (usually from values/strings.xml).


According to answers from @ojonugwa ochalifu and @Md Tarik Mahmud you should also right click on app folder then Refractor -> Remove Unused Resources
