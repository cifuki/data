Q:I'd like to find any unused resources in my Android project - this includes strings, ids, drawables, integers etc.

Does a tool to do this currently exist (preferably for Eclipse)?

A:If you use IntelliJ, which has Android support in the free community edition, you can do this by opening the generated R.java file (gen/R.java).  The unused resources will be marked with a warning for not being referenced anywhere in your project.

I'd be surprised if Eclipse doesn't do the same thing.
