Q:I'm using an android notification to alert the user once a service is finished (success or failure), and I want to delete local files once the process is done.

My problem is that in the event of failure - I want to let the user a "retry" option. and if he chooses not to retry and to dismiss the notification I want to delete local files saved for the process purposes (images...).

Is there a way to catch the notification's swipe-to-dismiss event?

A:DeleteIntent:
DeleteIntent is a PendingIntent object that can be associated with a notification and gets fired when the notification gets deleted, ether by :


User specific action
User Delete all the notifications.


You can set the Pending Intent to a broadcast Receiver and then perform any action you want.

  Intent intent = new Intent(this, MyBroadcastReceiver.class);
  PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this.getApplicationContext(), 0, intent, 0);
  Builder builder = new Notification.Builder(this):
 ..... code for your notification
  builder.setDeleteIntent(pendingIntent);


MyBroadcastReceiver

public class MyBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
      @Override
      public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
             .... code to handle cancel
         }

  }
