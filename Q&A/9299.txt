Q:I'm automating some things that involve the android keytool and jarsigner. The tool takes a keystore, the password for the keystore, the alias name, and the password for the alias / key, and I'm trying to find a way to explicitly check to see if the supplied password for the alias / key is correct.

Any ideas? Also, I need to check it without a jar file to sign - getting that file in my context is lengthy, so I want to abort sooner rather than later.

A:You can also check if the password is correct without attempting to change the password. I did it by listing the properties of the keystore with this command:

keytool -list -keystore <keystorefile> -storepass <passwordtocheck>
