Q:On recent android versions, number pickers use a blue divider when drawn (cf. image below).



I would like to change this color. Is there a working solution? or perhaps a library that package an updated version of NumberPicker that allows customizing the divider color?

I have tried android-numberpicker but I get an error (see below) at runtime due to some code from the library that tries to access to a resource id that does not exist.

android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Resource ID #0x0
        at android.content.res.Resources.getValue(Resources.java:1123)
        at android.content.res.Resources.loadXmlResourceParser(Resources.java:2309)
        at android.content.res.Resources.getLayout(Resources.java:939)
        at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:395)
        at net.simonvt.numberpicker.NumberPicker.<init>(NumberPicker.java:635)
        at net.simonvt.numberpicker.NumberPicker.<init>(NumberPicker.java:560)
        at net.simonvt.numberpicker.NumberPicker.<init>(NumberPicker.java:550)

A:Based on this (https://stackoverflow.com/a/20291416/2915480 although it's about DatePicker) there are several ways:


Write your own NumberPicker without mSelectionDivider and its affiliates or use backported by Vikram. In last case: 


download from lib from github
change drawable in res/drawable-xxx/np_numberpicker_selection_divider.9.png:


to transparent (or whatever) .9.png 
create np_numberpicker_selection_divider.xml shape line resource in res/drawable (with 0dp height or transparent color).

OR remove if (mSelectionDivider != null) branch from onDraw(Canvas) method in NumberPicker.java like here 

Use reflection to access private final field mSelectionDivider (details: https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/NumberPicker.java) - e.g. see modification here. 
I used reflection but it's not the best solution.
