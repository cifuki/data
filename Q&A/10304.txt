Q:The app I am currently working on has hundreds of images. At the moment I store them in the 'Drawable' folder. I was thinking about moving all of them to Assets folder. 

My question is: Is there any difference in performance when using both approaches?

A:I don't think so there is bit difference in performance of using these two folders, I think using drawable folder you can get easily images (All will be indexed in the R file, which makes it much faster (and much easier!) to load them.), and If you want to use it from asset then you have to use AssetManager then using AssetFileDescriptor you have to get those images. 


Assets can also be organized into a folder hierarchy, which is not
supported by resources. It's a different way of managing data.
Although resources cover most of the cases, assets have their
occasional use.
In the res/drawable directory each file is given a pre-compiled ID
which can be accessed easily through R.id.[res id]. This is useful to
quickly and easily access images, sounds, icons...
