Q:I am new to android development and I am programming a game. My game has cutsceens that play before each level starts, cutsceens which are done through videoview. My problem is, that upon an application pause, the cutsceen starts from the beginning again when resumed. 

    @Override
public void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    video.pause();
}
@Override
public void onResume()
{
    super.onResume();
    video.resume();
}


Our issue is that the video doesn't actually resume from where we paused it, but from the beginning.

A:You can use this

@Override
public void onPause() {
    Log.d(TAG, "onPause called");
    super.onPause();
    stopPosition = videoView.getCurrentPosition(); //stopPosition is an int
    videoView.pause();
}
@Override
public void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    Log.d(TAG, "onResume called");
    videoView.seekTo(stopPosition);
    videoView.start(); //Or use resume() if it doesn't work. I'm not sure
}
