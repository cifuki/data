Q:Question is

I get "HAX is not working and emulator runs in emulation mode", is this related to Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM) installation and running avd with cpu set to CPU Intel Atom (x86)? And even though it feels like AVD runs faster after i installed HAXM, does this message indicates that AVD performance is hindered. Should it be fixed and if so, how?

I am running on mac os x 10.9.1.

Listing what is installed on my system via android sdk manager:

Extras

Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM) AND I ALSO run dmg installer as well, and installed hot fix, after i found out about it.



AVD set up


Platform 4.4.2
API Level 19
CPU Intel Atom (x86)


Once i run avd:

(ruby-2.0.0-p353) .android   $ tools/emulator -avd 1AVD -wipe-data -no-boot-anim -cpu-delay 0


i get following and emulator eventually loads

emulator: The memory needed by this VM exceeds the driver limit.

HAX is not working and emulator runs in emulation mode

A:Yes it should be fixed, HAXM isn't working.
How much RAM is set for use inside your AVD configuration ?

768M is a good number for it, but most importantly this number has to be lower or equal to the memory usage you have set during the installation of HAXM. You can launch its installation again to modify it.
