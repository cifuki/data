Q:Is there any reason that the Android toolchain and development jars aren't in the Maven CEntral repository?  Is it really just that no one has done it?  or are there some licensing issues?  I mean it's all open source right?  (except for the Google APIs).

I'm tempted to put it up myself in a non central repo, but I just want to be sure that someone else hasn't done it yet and that I won't be corresponding or playing telephone tag with any lawyers as a result.

A:Google now has an official maven repository announced at Google IO 2017.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
          // Google Maven Repository
          url 'https://maven.google.com'
        }
    }
    ...
}
