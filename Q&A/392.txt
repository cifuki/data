Q:Is it possible to view Androidmanifest.xml file?

I just changed the extension of the apk file to zip. This zip file contains the Androidmanifest.xml file. But I am unable view the contents of Androidmanifest.xml. It is fully encrypted.

How can I view the Androidmanifest.xml file?

A:Yes you can view XML files of an Android APK file. There is a tool for this: android-apktool


  It is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd
  party, closed, binary Android apps


How to do this on your Windows System:


Download apktool-install-windows-* file 
Download apktool-* file 
Unpack both to your Windows directory


Now copy the APK file also in that directory and run the following command in your command prompt:

apktool d HelloWorld.apk ./HelloWorld


This will create a directory "HelloWorld" in your current directory. Inside it you can find the AndroidManifest.xml file in decrypted format, and you can also find other XML files inside the "HelloWorld/res/layout" directory. 

Here HelloWorld.apk is your Android APK file.
