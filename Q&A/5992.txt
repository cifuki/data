Q:I wish to simulate camera in the android emulator using the webcam. Basically I need to only take photos with the camera in the emulator (live preview is not needed i.e if it makes it any easier)

I followed the tutorial here which is the only one I could find that was close to my requirements 

But many of the libraries used in that tutorial(like android.hardware.CameraDevice) are not available in present sdk and are replaced by new libraries(like android.hardware.camera).

Any help on how to do this in the present sdk(2.1 or 2.2) would be much appreciated.

A:Update: ICS emulator supports camera.
