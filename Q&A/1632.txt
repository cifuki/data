Q:Can anyone help me to know about the Bundle savedInstanceState in onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) I am newbie in Android. I try to understand it from developer.android.com. But I am not able to understand. Can anyone simplify it?

A:If you save the state of the application in a bundle (typically non-persistent, dynamic data in onSaveInstanceState), it can be passed back to onCreate if the activity needs to be recreated (e.g., orientation change) so that you don't lose this prior information. If no data was supplied, savedInstanceState is null.


  ... you
  should use the onPause() method to write any persistent data (such as
  user edits) to storage. In addition, the method
  onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) is called before placing the activity in
  such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic
  instance state in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later
  received in onCreate(Bundle) if the activity needs to be re-created.
  See the Process Lifecycle section for more information on how the
  lifecycle of a process is tied to the activities it is hosting. Note
  that it is important to save persistent data in onPause() instead of
  onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) because the latter is not part of the
  lifecycle callbacks, so will not be called in every situation as
  described in its documentation.
