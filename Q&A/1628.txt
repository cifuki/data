Q:I have been trying for a few days now to make my layouts more efficient by converting from using several levels of nested LinearLayouts to one RelativeLayout and have come across a few problems that I haven not been able to find a workaround for...

I have searched the Android beginners group and this site and have not been able to find anything that would help me solve the problem.

I read on one of the blogs that you can combine layouts with merge and include tags. So what I have is a main layout file with a RelativeLayout root element.  Inside of that I have 5 include tags that reference 5 different xml layout files that each have a merge element for the root (all of my merge files are the same except for the ids in them). 

I am running into two problems, which I will explain after posting a simplified version of my layout code:

Sample Main Layout File:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:background="@drawable/translucent_gray" >

    <include 
        android:id="@+id/running_gallery_layout_id"
        layout="@layout/running_gallery_layout" />

    <include 
        android:id="@+id/recent_gallery_layout_id" 
        layout="@layout/recent_gallery_layout"
        android:layout_below="@id/running_gallery_layout_id" />

    <include
        android:id="@+id/service_gallery_layout_id"
        layout="@layout/service_gallery_layout"
        android:layout_below="@id/recent_gallery_layout_id" />

    <include
        android:id="@+id/process_gallery_layout_id"
        layout="@layout/process_gallery_layout"
        android:layout_below="@id/service_gallery_layout_id" />

</RelativeLayout>


Sample included merge file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<merge xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <TextView 
        style="@style/TitleText"
        android:id="@+id/service_gallery_title_text_id"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:gravity="left"
        android:text="@string/service_title" />

    <Gallery
        android:id="@+id/service_gallery_id"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_weight="1"
        android:layout_below="@id/service_gallery_title_text_id" />

    <TextView 
        style="@style/SubTitleText"
        android:id="@+id/service_gallery_current_text_id"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_toRightOf="@id/service_gallery_title_text_id"
        android:layout_above="@id/service_gallery_id" />
</merge>


I am running into two problems:

1) The android:layout_* attributes seem to be ignored when used in the include tag and all of the merged layouts are displayed on top of each other.  According to this post (http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/layout-tricks-reuse.html) "any android:layout_* attribute can be used with the <include /> tag"

2) Since I couldn't get this working I decided to try adding an android:layout_below attribute to the first TextView item in each merge layout file, meaning that each merge file would be referencing an id from another merge layout file... For the most part this actually worked and my layout looks fine.  However, I get an error on one of the android:layout_below attributes saying that it can't find the id I specified... I have double and triple checked the ids to make sure they were correct.  The weirdest part is that I used the AutoFill feature to put the id in the attribute in the first place.

If anyone has any suggestions or workarounds I will be more than happy to try them out.  Also, if anyone can think of a way for me to just have one merge xml layout file instead of 5 that would be greatly appreciated.  I couldn't find a way to do that because I need to have access to each item in the merge layout files at runtime...

A:There is an issue with the include tag. Check: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36908001

To fix it, make sure you overwrite BOTH layout_width and layout_height when including, otherwise everything will be ignored.
