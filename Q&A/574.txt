Q:So I installed the android sdk for Windows:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html   (the installation link) 

And ran into the path variable problem. So I fixed that by changing "PATH" in enviroment variables to include where my java.exe file is located from the JDK.  

But now when I open the android sdk manager, a cmd-like screen just briefly flashes on for half a second then disappears. I have no idea what's going on and how to get this thing working.

A:Make sure your java\\bin directory is in your path statement before the windows\\system32 directory. 
The SDK Manager uses java and it was finding the one in the system32 folder. 

In a CMD window, you can run 'where java'.
Don't forget to restart your CMD after changing the path variable for checking.

Hope this helps
