In my Android app I'am going to implement my strings with internationalization. I have a problem with the grammar and the way sentences build in different languages.

For example: 


  "5 minutes ago" - English
  
  "vor 5 Minuten" - German


Can I do something like the following in strings.xml?

<string name="timeFormat">{0} minutes ago</string>


And then some magic like

getString(R.id.timeFormat, dynamicTimeValue)


This behaviour would solve the other problem with different word orders as well.

A:Yes, just format your strings in the standard String.format() way.

See the method Context.getString(int, Object...) and the Android or Java Formatter documentation.

In your case, the string definition would be:

<string name="timeFormat">%1$d minutes ago</string>
