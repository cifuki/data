Q:Android Bluetooth Low Energy API implements 1 method to connect to the device connectGatt() but 2 methods to close the connection disconnect() and close().

Documentation says:


disconnect(): Disconnects an established connection, or cancels a connection attempt
   currently in progress.
close(): Application should call this method as early as possible after it is done with
     this GATT client.


The source code of BluetoothGatt.java shows that close() unregisters the application and disconnect() disconnect the client. However it does not say what that actually means. I mean, if there is only 1 way to connect to the client, why there are 2 ways to close/disconnect the connection?

A:With disconnect() you can later call connect() and continue with that cycle. 

Once you call close() you are done. If you want to connect again you will have to call connectGatt() on the BluetoothDevice again; close() will release any resources held by BluetoothGatt.
