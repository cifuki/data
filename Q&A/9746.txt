Q:Since Eclipse can run in Linux and this tablet has the new Honeycomb (Linux Kernel), can Eclipse IDE run in Android Honeycomb ?

I know that isn't pretty much comfortable coding in a tablet, but I'd want to use for UML modeling.

A:Android (despite its Linux roots) is far from capable of running Eclipse IDE as is. Not only is the hardware inadequate for supporting such a large application, but Android lacks a full Java SE JVM (Dalvik is a subset) and SWT (Eclipse UI framework) implementation for native Android UI controls does not exist. On Linux, SWT implementations exist only for GTK and Motif.

You may be interested in project Orion, which is an effort at eclipse.org to create Eclipse-like experience in the browser. I understand that people have been able to use Orion from a mobile browser on devices such as the one on the iPad.
