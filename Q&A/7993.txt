Q:I'm trying to set up location updates in my Android app using com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:12.0.0, but I'm getting the following error:


  LocationRequest constructor is marked as internal and should not be accessed from apps


My location updates request looks like this:

locationClient.requestLocationUpdates(
    new LocationRequest()
        .setInterval(5000)
        .setFastestInterval(1000)
        .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY),
    locationCallback,
    null
);


I have followed the docs and the example, which do it the same way. If I'm not supposed to call new LocationRequest(), then what is the proper way to do it?

A:Use static methodLocationRequest create ().

 LocationRequest locationRequest = LocationRequest.create();
 locationRequest.setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY);
 locationRequest.setInterval(5000);
 locationRequest.setFastestInterval(1000);
