Q:I want to know whether there is a method to access local files (say text files, web pages) of the filesystem in Android emulator.

I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 for Android development.

A:You can use the adb command which comes in the tools dir of the SDK:

adb shell


It will give you a command line prompt where you can browse and access the filesystem. Or you can extract the files you want:

adb pull /sdcard/the_file_you_want.txt


Also, if you use eclipse with the ADT, there's a view to browse the file system (Window->Show View->Other... and choose Android->File Explorer)
