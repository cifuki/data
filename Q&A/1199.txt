Q:I'm designing a view with multiple pages. I want edges of previous and next pages to be show like below and implement a 2 finger swipe to switch between pages.



I tried using ViewPager with negative page margin as suggested here but that only shows one of the edges on the screen, not both simultaneously.

Alternatively, is there any way i can position part of my view outside screen and then animate it giving it a ViewPager type effect. 

How should I go about it ? Thanks !

A:Quoting myself from a blog post on this subject:


  The third approach comes from Dave Smith, co-author of the well-regarded book Android Recipes. He went in a very different direction, using a custom container that disabled children clipping to show more than one page at a time.
  
  His published sample code shows the whole thing in action. His container (com.example.pagercontainer.PagerContainer) wraps the ViewPager and calls setClipChildren(false); on itself, so even though the ViewPager is focused on one selected page, other pages that have coordinates beyond the ViewPager bounds are still visible, so long as they fit within the PagerContainer. By sizing the ViewPager to be smaller than the PagerContainer, the ViewPager can size its pages to that size, leaving room for other pages to be seen. PagerContainer, though, needs to help out a bit with touch events, as ViewPager will only handle swipe events on its own visible bounds, ignoring any pages visible to the sides.
