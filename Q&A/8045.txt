Q:In Java I would do something like:

java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment ge = 
                      java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
Font[] fonts = ge.getAllFonts(); 


is there an Android equivalent?

A:Taken from Mark Murphy's answer on the Android Developers mailing list:


  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface.html
  
  There are only three fonts: normal
  (Droid Sans), serif (Droid Serif), and
  monospace (Droid Sans Mono).
  
  While there may be additional fonts
  buried in WebKit somewhere, they
  appear to be inaccessible to
  developers outside of WebKit. :-(
  
  The only other fonts are any TrueType ones you bundle with your application.


Edit: Roboto is a new font which came in with Android 4.0. You can use this library project to use it in all versions back to API level 4 https://github.com/mcalliph/roboto-text-view
