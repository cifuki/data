Q:I have an issue with importing a picture from the Album in Android, because the onActivityResult() method is never called.

This is the code that I wrote (called from a fragment not an activity):

Intent galleryIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,  android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI);
getActivity().startActivityForResult(galleryIntent, PICK_IMAGE);


And by the way, I have defined the onActivityResult() but it's never triggered:

@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    Log.d(TAG, "onActivityResult"); // not printed
}


Any idea what's wrong with this? 

Thanks!

A:To have onActivityResult() called in the fragment, you should call  the fragment's version of startActivityForResult(), not the activity's. So in your fragment's code, replace

getActivity().startActivityForResult(galleryIntent, PICK_IMAGE);


with

startActivityForResult(galleryIntent, PICK_IMAGE);
