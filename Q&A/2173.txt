Q:Over the last few months, I've published several revisions to my app. Unfortunately, I didn't keep copies of all the old APKs, and now I'd like to test upgrade from the old versions to my new version. Is there any way to download Google's copy of my old versions? The Google Play developer console shows my old APKs, but without a download link. I tried "Real APK Leecher", but that doesn't let you choose the APK version you want to download. And I'm not able to even temporarily reactivate the old version in the Developer Console since it complains that it's of an earlier version.

A:THE ANSWER IS OUTDATED. NOW THIS IS POSSIBLE, CHECK @tesla's AND @olleh's ANSWERS

No, unfortunately.

The Android Developer Console is a real disaster, everywhere you look there is something that needs to be fixed or improved, being this issue you mention one of them. Unfortunately for the  time being you're out of luck. Unless Google enables this, you cannot download old APKS's. I suppose you could recompile the old code, but I guess you don't have that either and that's why you are here :-)
