Q:My windows is on a 128GB ssd hard drive and its running out of space. the folder
C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Android has 2 folders android-sdk and sdk folders that use about 30GB of space.

Is it possible to move these folders to an external hard drive?

If it is possible what changes should I make in the android studio?

A:I do the same thing. In Android Studio go to Settings, select Appearance and Behaviour then System Settings then Android SDK

You can choose the SDK location at the top.

You'll need to copy/paste the files to that location to save yourself the downloading time.
