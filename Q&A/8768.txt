Q:After update to v23.2.0 recyclerview items have strange behavior: very big with empty space. After update to design library 23.2.0 menu overflow icon became black (app has dark action bar).

UPDATE
On my nexus 5 overflow icon & recycler view row are fixed, but on Galaxy Tab 4 overflow icon is still black.

UPDATE 2
If you have problems with empty spacing, fix layout parameters for your views (match_parent -> wrap_content), cause RecyclerView will now size itself based on the size of its contents.

  The RecyclerView widget provides an advanced and flexible base for creating lists and grids as well as supporting animations. This release brings an exciting new feature to the LayoutManager API: auto-measurement! This allows a RecyclerView to size itself based on the size of its contents. This means that previously unavailable scenarios, such as using WRAP_CONTENT for a dimension of the RecyclerView, are now possible. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find all built in LayoutManagers now support auto-measurement.
  
  Due to this change, make sure to double check the layout parameters of
  your item views: previously ignored layout parameters (such as
  MATCH_PARENT in the scroll direction) will now be fully respected.


UPDATE 3

A:The reason you are getting large open spaces is because of match_parent. It wasn't working correctly before, but now with the new release it is working differently. You just need to update to wrap_content instead of match_parent as that causes the layout to match the parent giving you the large spaces.
