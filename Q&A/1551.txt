Q:Is there a way to add a simple header/footer to a RecyclerView? 

Here you can see what I've got. The first Card touches the Toolbar

And here you can see what I want. 8dp Padding between the bottom and the Card. 

 

Methods I tried so far:

 Use a header view in my recyclerview. But I think it is very unefficient to do this for every recyclerview.

 use a 8dp top margin which results in the problem that the recyclerview has white bars on top/bottom when scrolling.

add a padding to the list item which results in different margins between the outer and inner cards.


I'm sure that there is a simple solution which I don't know so far.

A:Adding a top padding and setting clipToPadding to false will do the trick.
Something like this:

  <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
    android:id="@+id/recyclerview"
    android:paddingTop="8dp"
    android:clipToPadding="false"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
