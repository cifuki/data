Q:Hope all of you aware of this class, used to get notification token whenever firebase notification token got refreshed we get the refreshed token from this class, From following method.

@Override
public void onTokenRefresh() {
    // Get updated InstanceID token.
    String refreshedToken = FirebaseInstanceId.getInstance().getToken();
    Log.d(TAG, "Refreshed token: " + refreshedToken);
}


To use this as i want to implement FCM, I extended MyClass from FirebaseInstanceIdService

But, Showing that FirebaseInstanceIdService is deprecated

Does anybody know this?,
What method or class i should use instead of this to get refreshed token as this is deprecated.

I'm using : implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:17.1.0'

I checked the document for same there is nothing mentioned about this. : FCM SETUP DOCUMENT



UPDATE

This issue has been Fixed.

As Google deprecated the FirebaseInstanceService,

I asked the question to find the way and i get to know that We can get the Token from FirebaseMessagingService,

As before, when i asked the Question Documents were not updated but Now Google docs updated so for more info, Refer this google doc : FirebaseMessagingService

OLD From : FirebaseInstanceService  (Deprecated) 

@Override
public void onTokenRefresh() {
    // Get updated InstanceID token.
    String refreshedToken = FirebaseInstanceId.getInstance().getToken();
    Log.d(TAG, "Refreshed token: " + refreshedToken);
}


NEW From : FirebaseMessagingService

@Override
public void onNewToken(String s) {
    super.onNewToken(s);
    Log.d("NEW_TOKEN",s);
}


Thanks.

A:firebaser here

Check the reference documentation for FirebaseInstanceIdService:


  This class was deprecated.
  
  In favour of overriding onNewToken in FirebaseMessagingService. Once that has been implemented, this service can be safely removed.


Weirdly enough the JavaDoc for FirebaseMessagingService doesn't mention the onNewToken method yet. It looks like not all updated documentation wasn't published yet. I've filed an internal issue to get the updates to the reference docs published, and to get the samples in the guide updated too. 

In the meantime both the old/deprecated calls, and the new ones should work. If you're having trouble with either, post the code and I'll have a look.
