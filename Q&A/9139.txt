Q:I am integrating my application with google plus. I have installed google play services and signed in to my account. Also I could publish and plus one for what ever I want.

My problem

I can't change the text of the sign in button.

My code 

<com.google.android.gms.common.SignInButton
        android:id="@+id/share_button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
        android:text="Share on Google+" />


What I have tried? 


First, I tried adding this line to the xml 

android:text="Share on Google+"

Secondly, I tried to set the text programmatically, however it didn't work.


Any help would be appreciated.

Edit

If it is not possible, is there any way so I can use the same google sign in button on another button?

A:Here is the technique that I used:

protected void setGooglePlusButtonText(SignInButton signInButton, String buttonText) {
    // Find the TextView that is inside of the SignInButton and set its text
    for (int i = 0; i < signInButton.getChildCount(); i++) {
        View v = signInButton.getChildAt(i);

        if (v instanceof TextView) {
            TextView tv = (TextView) v;
            tv.setText(buttonText);
            return;
        }
    }
}
