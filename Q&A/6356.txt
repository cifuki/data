Q:I have 2 branches in my gitlab project. Now I'm on the master (default) branch. I want to change it to another base, this is what I tried:

When I go to VCS -> Git -> Branches, and click Checkout tag or revision I always get an error :


  pathspec 'my branch' did not match any files known to git


What should I do? All I want to do is to change the branch and do a pull request.

A:To checkout a different branch from within Android Studio:

Under VCS -> Git -> Branches you will see this screen



under Local branches you will see the local branches you can checkout. At the very bottom you see the currently checked out branch (in my case master). To checkout a different branch, select it and click Checkout.



In my example I only have one other local branch, named test. That is why it only shows that one.

After checking out a different branch, this window will pop up in the bottom of the screen





In order to get your remote branches to show up in Android Studio, you first need to fetch them:

VCS -> Git -> Fetch. After that, it will show up
