A:UPDATE (Jul 2015):

Since getRunningTasks() get deprecated, from API 21 it's better to follow raukodraug answer or Ed Burnette one (I would prefer second one).


There's possibility to check current tasks and their stack using ActivityManager.

So, to determine if an activity is the last one:


request android.permission.GET_TASKS permissions in the manifest.
Use the following code:

ActivityManager mngr = (ActivityManager) getSystemService( ACTIVITY_SERVICE );

List<ActivityManager.RunningTaskInfo> taskList = mngr.getRunningTasks(10);

if(taskList.get(0).numActivities == 1 &&
   taskList.get(0).topActivity.getClassName().equals(this.getClass().getName())) {
    Log.i(TAG, "This is last activity in the stack");
}



Please note, that above code will be valid only if You have single task. If there's possibility that number of tasks will exist for Your application - You'll need to check other taskList elements. Read more about tasks Tasks and Back Stack
