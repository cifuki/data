Q:How do you use SharedPreferences in a non-Activity class? I tried making a generic Preferences utility class and importing android.content.Context but Eclipse still wouldn't let me use getSharedPreferences().

A:SharedPreferences are related to context.
You can only reference it through a context.

You can simply pass context as a parameter to your class.
For example in the constructor.

In your activity do:

MyClass myClass = new MyClass(this);
