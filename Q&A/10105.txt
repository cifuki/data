Q:Currently I am using this code to see the divider lines:

medalsList.setDivider(new ColorDrawable(0x99F10529));
medalsList.setDividerHeight(1);


What is the default RGB color (as shown in the code above) used on a ListView that hasn't had its divider lines changed?

A:The default divider is determined by the listDivider item in the current theme. For the stock themes, the default divider is one of:


android:drawable/divider_horizontal_dark (Theme)
android:drawable/divider_horizontal_bright (Theme.Light)
android:drawable/divider_horizontal_holo_dark (Theme.Holo)
android:drawable/divider_horizontal_holo_light (Theme.Holo.Light)


Those drawables can be found in the platforms data folder of your sdk installation.
