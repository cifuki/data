Q:OS version: Ubuntu 14.04 LTE 64 Bit

Java JRE/JDK version: Oracle JDK 1.8.0_11

Project directory is on a NTFS based drive.

Whenever I try to clean my project I get something like below.


  :app:clean FAILED Error:Execution failed for task ':app:clean'.
  
  
    Unable to delete file: /media/DriveA/AndroidStudioWorkspace/DNA/app/build/intermediates/classes/debug/.../mechandising/MerchandizingActivity$3.class
  


When I try to delete the build folder manually I get the following error.


  Error when getting information for file
  '/media/DriveA/AndroidStudioWorkspace/DNA/app/build/intermediates/pre-dexed':
  Input/output error


I am unable to figure out whether its a Linux problem or a Studio problem. I don't face such a problem in Eclipse (Same Drive) so I am just considering it to be something wrong with my studio.

Any Suggestions??

A:I had the same problem.

You need to go to the source file directly. 
Close the studio and go to the path the issue is located at and delete the folder there.
