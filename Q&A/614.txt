Q:I would like to alter the layout based on whether the virtual keyboard is shown or not. I've searched the API and various blogs but can't seem to find anything useful.

Is it possible?

Thanks!

A:Note


  This solution will not work for soft keyboards and
  onConfigurationChanged will not be called for soft (virtual)
  keyboards.




You've got to handle configuration changes yourself.

http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html#HandlingTheChange

Sample:

// from the link above
@Override
public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);


    // Checks whether a hardware keyboard is available
    if (newConfig.hardKeyboardHidden == Configuration.HARDKEYBOARDHIDDEN_NO) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "keyboard visible", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    } else if (newConfig.hardKeyboardHidden == Configuration.HARDKEYBOARDHIDDEN_YES) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "keyboard hidden", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}


Then just change the visibility of some views, update a field, and change your layout file.
