Q:After adding new items in strings.xml, quite often they don't start working immediately in Android Studio's Preview. 


  Couldn't resolve resource @string/faq_customer_service


Preview looks like this: 



I've obviously tried to re-build the project, and even run gradle clean assembleDebug, but it doesn't seem to help. On emulator & real device the newly-added string resources do work.

Any trick to force Android Studio to reload the resources so that the correct texts show up in Preview?

A:The only reliable way I've found so far is reloading the project / restarting Android Studio.

Quickest way to do that is File → Invalidate caches / Restart... → Just Restart.

Feel free to post better solutions!
