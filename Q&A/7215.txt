Q:If I have a vector image in a program like Illustrator, how can I end up with the correct format for Android's VectorDrawable framework to use?

I found a tool to convert SVG to the VectorDrawable xml format: http://inloop.github.io/svg2android/
but it requires SVGs only use "path". 

Any ideas how to output files like that?

A:That tool only appears to currently support <path> elements.  So for example it doesn't support <rect>, <circle> etc.

If you are using primitives like this in your drawing, you need to convert them.  I forget the exact option you need to use, but it's probably something like "Convert to path".
