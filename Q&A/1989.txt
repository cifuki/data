A:You check this blog in the link below

ANDROID_ID

import android.provider.Settings.Secure;

private String android_id = Secure.getString(getContext().getContentResolver(),
                                                    Secure.ANDROID_ID); 


The above is from the link @ Is there a unique Android device ID?

More specifically, Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID. This is a 64-bit quantity that is generated and stored when the device first boots. It is reset when the device is wiped.

ANDROID_ID seems a good choice for a unique device identifier. There are downsides: First, it is not 100% reliable on releases of Android prior to 2.2 (\xe2\x80\x9cFroyo\xe2\x80\x9d). Also, there has been at least one widely-observed bug in a popular handset from a major manufacturer, where every instance has the same ANDROID_ID.

The below solution is not a good one coz the value survives device wipes (\xe2\x80\x9cFactory resets\xe2\x80\x9d) and thus you could end up making a nasty mistake when one of your customers wipes their device and passes it on to another person.

You get the imei number of the device using the below

  TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager)getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
  telephonyManager.getDeviceId();

Add this is manifest

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
