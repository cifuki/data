Q:We have an existing web site, and I've been asked to test its compatibility with mobile browsers.

I've installed the Android SDK onto my desktop PC. I'm able to view my localhost site in the emulator, and I have identified a number of glitches in the page layout which occur in the Android browser. 

But since none of these issues occur in any desktop browser, I've been struggling with how to debug them. For example, in Firefox, it's very easy to use Firebug to see what stylesheets have been appies and to adjust them on the fly to see how it affects the layout. But I haven't found a way to do anything similar on the Android emulator.

The question is, short of trial+error, how do I go about working out what is causing those layout issues? Does the Android browser (or the Android SDK) have any kind of tools that are useful for debugging CSS? If so, how do I use them?

[EDIT] I haven't found a solution to this, so I'm throwing open the doors to the bounty hunters...

A:Weinre is probably the closest to what you're looking for:

If what you're looking for is something that allows you to tweak layout in realtime it should make you happy.
