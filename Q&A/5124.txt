Q:This seems like a trivial problem, but is has me kind of stumped. I want to load an HTML string using Html.fromHtml(), and have any links in the string to be clickable and open in the browser.

Basic example:

textView.setText(Html.fromHtml("<a href=\\"http://www.google.com\\">This is a link</a>"));


With this snippet, the text is formatted as if it were a link (blue, underlined), but it's not clickable. I tried Linkify, but it only seems to work with links that are not HTML-based.

Any suggestions?

A:As I assumed, the solution was trivial:

textView.setText(Html.fromHtml("<a href=\\"http://www.google.com\\">This is a link</a>"));
textView.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance());


The second line somehow activates the link behavior, although I'm not quite sure how. The same question is addressed over at Google Code.
