Q:Code for sending sms that worked perfectly till Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) stopped working since 4.4 (KitKat)

I'm just preparing the text message for the user, but he needs to choose the number to send to

The code I have used is:

Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);         
    sendIntent.setData(Uri.parse("sms:"));
    sendIntent.putExtra("sms_body", smsText);

    activity.startActivity(sendIntent);


Since it stopped working I tried also the ACTION_SEND and ACTION_SENDTO Both didn't worked, I also tried the sendIntent.setType("vnd.android-dir/mms-sms");, again nothing worked.

I looked for several answers in stackoverflow answer 1 and answer 2, but both answers aren't dealing with the requirements I have.

What I would like to do:


Send sms with sms app only, not by all apps that serves the send intent
Prepare the text for the user
Let the user choose the phone number to send the message to


For moderators:
It is not a duplicate questions, since the questions, doesn't ask the exact same thing, the need here is to send sms with no phone number, and none of the questions and answers dealt with that.

A:I attached a code that solve the problem by doing the following:


Check the OS version
In case that older version (prior to KitKat), use the old method
If new API, check the default sms package. if there is any, set it as the package, otherwise, let the user choose the sharing app.


Here is the code:

if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) //At least KitKat
    {
        String defaultSmsPackageName = Telephony.Sms.getDefaultSmsPackage(activity); //Need to change the build to API 19

        Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        sendIntent.setType("text/plain");
        sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, smsText);

        if (defaultSmsPackageName != null)//Can be null in case that there is no default, then the user would be able to choose any app that support this intent.
        {
            sendIntent.setPackage(defaultSmsPackageName);
        }
        activity.startActivity(sendIntent);

    }
    else //For early versions, do what worked for you before.
    {
        Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
        sendIntent.setData(Uri.parse("sms:"));
        sendIntent.putExtra("sms_body", smsText);
        activity.startActivity(sendIntent);
    }
