Q:I updated the Android SDK tools from revision 11 to revision 12, and the emulator now fails to start.  When I try to run emulator.exe, I get:


  invalid command-line parameter: Files\\Android\\android-sdk\\tools/emulator-arm.exe.
  Hint: use '@foo' to launch a virtual device named 'foo'.
  please use -help for more information


The path to emulator.exe is C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-sdk\\tools.

How do I fix it?

A:As was previously suggested, it does seem to be caused by the fact that there is a space in the default installation path of the Android SDK: C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-sdk\\

There are a couple of possible solves, though-


move installation directories to paths that do not contains spaces (as already mentioned)... 
but simpler and possibly slightly less cumbersome is simply adjusting the path in Eclipse to use 8-dot-3 directory name(s). Since I'm running Win7, I have two Program Files directories, the second one being "Program Files (x86)" which is where the sdk installed. So the 8-dot-3 path is PROGRA~2. Thus, I simply changed the "SDK Location" value in the Android Preferences in Eclipse from C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-sdk\\ to C:\\PROGRA~2\\Android\\android-sdk\\ and everything now works fine.



  If you don't know the 8-dot-3 name of your desired path, just fire up a Command Prompt and execute "DIR /X"... the short name will be displayed next to each directory.
