A:Navigate to [Android SDK Folder] --> Extra --> Intel --> Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager
and double click on HAXM installer intelhaxm-android.exe (on Mac IntelHAXM_6.2.1.dmg) and install it manually.

If you do not have latest version of HAXM then you can open sdk manager in android studio and download it. 



Although, this should be installed automatically when you install Android Studio. See below.




  Answering @DougThompson Question: 
  What if HAXM installer not installing automatically ?




In that case, 


you can download HAXM installer from https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-intel-haxm.
Keep the installer at [Android SDK Folder] --> Extra --> Intel 
Extract and install it manually.


now you are done.
