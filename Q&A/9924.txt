Q:What mobile platform should I start learning?
What matters is:

A:I think 3-4 platforms have a future. But it depends on what platform do you like and how you like freedom in distributing your applications :)


Windows Phone 7


.NET and Silverlight
through Windows Phone Marketplace

Android 


Java 
through Android Market (fees) or like normal applications

iPhone 


Objective-C or Java (Developing iPhone Applications using Java)
through iPhone Market 
pay some fees ($99/year)
The Incredible App Store Hype
You need Mac (Mac OS) for development (thanks to ctacke)

Windows Mobile (my favorite)


C++ or .NET 
free distribution, just like normal applications
Microsoft have a market, too - here

Java 


J2ME or JavaFX
