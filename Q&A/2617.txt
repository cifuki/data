Q:I wrote a piece of code that will give the user a prompt asking them to press back again if they would like to exit. I currently have my code working to an extent but I know it is written poorly and I assume there is a better way to do it. Any suggestions would be helpful!

Code:

public void onBackPressed(){
    backpress = (backpress + 1);
    Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), " Press Back again to Exit ", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

    if (backpress>1) {
        this.finish();
    }
}

A:I would implement a dialog asking the user if they wanted to exit and then call super.onBackPressed() if they did.

@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    new AlertDialog.Builder(this)
        .setTitle("Really Exit?")
        .setMessage("Are you sure you want to exit?")
        .setNegativeButton(android.R.string.no, null)
        .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.yes, new OnClickListener() {

            public void onClick(DialogInterface arg0, int arg1) {
                WelcomeActivity.super.onBackPressed();
            }
        }).create().show();
}


In the above example, you'll need to replace WelcomeActivity with the name of your activity.
