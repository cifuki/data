Q:I have a situation in an Android app where I want to start a network activity (sending out some data) which should run every second. I achieve this as follows:

In the onCreate() I have the code:

tv = new TextView(this);
tv.postDelayed(sendData, 1000);


The sendData() function:

   Handler handler = new Handler();
   private Runnable sendData=new Runnable(){
    public void run(){
        try {
            //prepare and send the data here..
            handler.removeCallbacks(sendData);
            handler.postDelayed(sendData, 1000);    
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }   
    }
};


The problem come in like this: When user presses the back buttons and app comes out (UI disappears) the sendData() function still gets executed which is what I want.  Now when user re-starts the app, my onCreate() gets called again and I get sendData() invoked twice a second. It goes on like that.  Every time user comes out and starts again, one more sendData() per second happens.  

What am I doing wrong?  Is it my new Handler() creating problem?  What is the best way to handle this?  I want one sendData() call per second until user quits the app (form application manager).

A:Why don't you create service and put logic in onCreate(). In this case even if you press back button service will keep on executing. and once you enter into application it will not call
onCreate() again. Rather it will call onStart()
