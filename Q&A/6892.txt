Q:I'm trying to uploading my Android Project on github but I get this error when I try to push:

Push rejected: Push to origin/master was rejected


I made this steps:


VCS->Import into version control->Create new repository...
From the git bash in Project folder:

git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[project_name].git
Git->Add
Git-> Commit directory
Git-> Push

A:As suggested in the comments you should pull the changes first, if you are working on a new repository that could happened when you create your remote repo with a readme or a licence file. To pull the changes from the user interface you should use, VCS > Git > Pull then select the master branch (depends)



after that you can Git > Push without problem.
