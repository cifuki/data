Q:I have an ImageView with android:src set to a ShapedDrawable, namely a white circle. What I want is to colorize this ImageView in runtime responding to some events. imgView.setColorFilter seems to be solution, but after using this (tried different parameters) the image becomes invisible (I don't see it at the screen).

How to solve this? And are there better ways to have color circles?

A:Alright, I had a quick play with this and noticed your issue of the circles disappearing. Without you describing what exactly you tried, I assume you haven't tried setting the color filter to the Drawable itself yet? (as opposed to the ImageView, which only seems to work with BitmapDrawables).

The following statements work perfectly fine for an xml-declared ShapeDrawable with white as initial color:

ImageView redCircle = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.circle_red_imageview);
ImageView greenCircle = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.circle_green_imageview);
ImageView blueCircle = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.circle_blue_imageview);

// we can create the color values in different ways:
redCircle.getDrawable().setColorFilter(Color.RED, PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY );
greenCircle.getDrawable().setColorFilter(0xff00ff00, PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY );
blueCircle.getDrawable().setColorFilter(getResources().getColor(R.color.blue), PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY );


The ShapeDrawable for completeness: (I set the size on the ImageView, see below)

<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:shape="oval" >
    <solid android:color="@android:color/white" />
</shape>


And one of the ImageViews as example:

<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/circle_red_imageview"
    android:layout_width="40dp"
    android:layout_height="40dp"
    android:padding="5dp"
    android:src="@drawable/circle_white" />


Visual result:
