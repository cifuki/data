Q:I want to combine two intent flags as we do bellow in android

Intent intent = new Intent(this, MapsActivity.class);
intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK|Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);


I tried doing something like this but it didn't work for me

val intent = Intent(context, MapActivity::class.java)
intent.flags = (Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)

A:Explanation:

The operation that is applied to the flags is a bitwise or. In Java you have the | operator for that.


  As of bitwise operations [in Kotlin], there're no special characters
  for them, but just named functions that can be called in infix form.

Here a list of all bitwise operations for Int and Long


shl(bits) \xe2\x80\x93 signed shift left (Java's <<)
shr(bits) \xe2\x80\x93 signed shift right (Java's >>)
ushr(bits) \xe2\x80\x93 unsigned shift right (Java's >>>)
and(bits) \xe2\x80\x93 bitwise and (Java's &)
or(bits) \xe2\x80\x93 bitwise or (Java's |)
xor(bits) \xe2\x80\x93 bitwise xor (Java's ^)
inv() \xe2\x80\x93 bitwise inversion (Java's ~)


Solution:

So, in your case you only need to call or in between your arguments like so.

intent.flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
