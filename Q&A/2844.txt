Q:I've searched around on Google and came across this site where I found a question similar to mine in which how to include a image in a TextView text, for example "hello my name is [image]", and the answer was this:

ImageSpan is = new ImageSpan(context, resId);
text.setSpan(is, index, index + strLength, 0);


I would like to know in this code,


What am I supposed to type or do in the context?
Am I supposed to do something to the text.setSpan() like import or reference or leave it text?


If someone can break this down for me that would be much appreciated.

A:Try this ..

    txtview.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(
                    R.drawable.image, 0, 0, 0);


Also see this.. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html 

Try this in xml file 

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/txtStatus"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_gravity="center"
        android:drawableLeft="@drawable/image"
        android:drawablePadding="5dp"
        android:singleLine="true"
        android:text="@string/name"/>
