Q:I'm developing a social networking app and our users can connect their Instagram account to our service. I'd like to open Instagram profiles directly in their official Android app (if it is installed) but I can't find any way to do that. However, there is a page on their developer site about the exact same feature on iOS but this doesn't seem to work on Android at all. Everything I found on the web only suggests various ways to open links in a browser. Any suggestions?

A:I solved this problem using the following code.

    Uri uri = Uri.parse("http://instagram.com/_u/xxx");
    Intent likeIng = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);

    likeIng.setPackage("com.instagram.android");

    try {
        startActivity(likeIng);
    } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {
        startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW,
                Uri.parse("http://instagram.com/xxx")));
    }
