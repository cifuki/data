Q:I am not able to debug an app on my device (Asus Zenphone 2) after I updated android studio to 2.0. I keep seeing below message in debug tab right after I click on debug icon in Android studio.

Message in debug tab in Android Studio UI

---------------------------------------------------------------
Waiting for application to come online: packagename
Waiting for application to come online: packagename
Waiting for application to come online: packagename
Waiting for application to come online: packagename


I keep seeing Alert Dialog with the title "Waiting for Debugger" and Force close button all the time.

I searched but it seems only two results from google for that message.

I restarted Android studio, checked developer settings on phone...

Have anyone faced with this issue. Please help me. I cannot run the emulator, because my mac will be too lag. Thank you in advance.

A:I found the issue. See this image below:



First I select the second option, and it worked fine. But then don't know why I change to select first option. So, the debugger shows the message Waiting for application to come online forever. And I did not notice that, just thought another app prevent me debug or that was an issue with Android Studio 2.0.

So, just check to second option will solve my issue. Thank all.
