Q:I would like to play around with some ideas and develop a soft keyboard for Android to replace the default one.


Is there any general information about soft keyboard development for Android out there? Any best practices or guidelines?
Can I do with my keyboard application pretty much anything I could do with a normal Android application?
Can I do HTTP connections to synchronize keyboard data with a cloud DB and other phones I have?
Can I open other windows/screens from a key press, e.g. to display a custom input interface different to a normal QWERTY one. If that doesn't work, can I use a pop-up dialog instead?

About your questions:

An inputMethod is basically an Android Service, so yes, you can do HTTP and all the stuff you can do in a Service.

You can open Activities and dialogs from the InputMethod. Once again, it's just a Service.

I've been developing an IME, so ask again if you run into an issue.
