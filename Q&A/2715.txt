Q:I have a trouble finding a way how to parse JSONArray.
It looks like this:

[{"name":"name1","url":"url1"},{"name":"name2","url":"url2"},...]


I  know how to parse it if the JSON was written differently (In other words, if I had json object returned instead of an array of objects). 
But it's all I have and have to go with it.

*EDIT: It is a valid json. I made an iPhone app using this json, now I need to do it for Android and cannot figure it out.
There are a lot of examples out there, but they are all JSONObject related. I need something for JSONArray.

Can somebody please give me some hint, or a tutorial or an example?

Much appreciated !

A:use the following snippet to parse the JsonArray.

JSONArray jsonarray = new JSONArray(jsonStr);
for (int i = 0; i < jsonarray.length(); i++) {
    JSONObject jsonobject = jsonarray.getJSONObject(i);
    String name = jsonobject.getString("name");
    String url = jsonobject.getString("url");
}


Hope it helps.
