Q:This question already has an answer here:
    
        
            Is there a way to have a common section with buildConfigField and resValue in gradle?

I have a number of flavors in my app, and I want to set a boolean buildConfigField for a subset of them. Is there a way to avoid having to add the field to every flavor? Ideally my build.gradle would look like the following:

productFlavors {
    flavor1 {
    }

    ....

    flavor4 {
        buildConfigField "boolean", "DISABLE_SOMETHING", "true"
    }

    flavor5 {
        buildConfigField "boolean", "DISABLE_SOMETHING", "true"
    }

    ....

    flavor8 {
    }
}


So in my app I can just go

if (BuildConfig.DISABLE_SOMETHING) {
    //disable stuff
}


However, compilation fails when I try to build with, for example, flavor1, as it can't find the field. I don't want to have to remember to add this to every new flavor I create. Are there any ways around this?

A:You can use defaultConfig for this (inside android{})

defaultConfig {
  buildConfigField "boolean", "DISABLE_SOMETHING", "true"
}
