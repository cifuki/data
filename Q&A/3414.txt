Q:I am having a weird problem.I got this error after I updated Android Studio from 2.3.3 to 3.0..The problem is when I try to install apk file it says

App not installed.
The package appears to be corrupt.

I have tried generating apk in both debug and release version and tried to install but whenever I install apk it show the same message..

When I run the android project from android studio it is working.
May be the gradle problem but couldn't fix it.
Please help
