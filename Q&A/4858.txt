Q:Is it possible to add extra languages to Android? My current Android phone only supports English and Chinese language input. I would like to have Dutch also, as I can use it for word completion. The question on top of that is, how to switch easily between these languages in the text input (keyboard) GUI?

A:On android 2.2 you can input multiple language and switch by sliding on the spacebar. Go in the settings under "language and keyboard" and then "Android Keyboard", "Input language".

Hope this helps.
