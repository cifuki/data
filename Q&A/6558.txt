Q:I have a service which is binded to application context like this: 

getApplicationContext().bindService(
                    new Intent(this, ServiceUI.class),
                    serviceConnection,
                    Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE
            );

protected void onDestroy() {
            super.onDestroy();                  
            getApplicationContext().unbindService(serviceConnection);
        }


For some reason, only sometimes the application context does not bind properly (I can't fix that part), however in onDestroy() I do unbindservice which throws an error

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Service not registered: tools.cdevice.Devices$mainServiceConnection.


My question is: Is there a way to call unbindservice safely or check if it is already bound to a service before unbinding it?

Thanks in advance.

A:Try this:

boolean isBound = false;
...
isBound = getApplicationContext().bindService( new Intent(getApplicationContext(), ServiceUI.class), serviceConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE );
...
if (isBound)
    getApplicationContext().unbindService(serviceConnection);


Note:

You should use same context for binding a service and unbinding a service. If you are binding Service with getApplicationContext() so you should also use getApplicationContext.unbindService(..)
