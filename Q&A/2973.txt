Q:I am new to Android.  I am working in the Windows OS with the Eclipse IDE. My simple application has a spinner that populates a list from database column. When I click on the spinner Class, the file Editor says that source not found and the android.jar has no source attachment.

I downloaded the source code and placed it in this location:

android-sdk-windows\\platforms\\android-8 

Then, I attached this source by these steps:

right click the project => build path=> configure build path=> libraries => source attachment => give the path of the source code downloaded.

But, I didn't get any solution for my debug. Again, when clicking on the spinner it opens the debug that android.jar has no source attachment.

A:To attach source code for android.jar, you may follow the tutorial at the link below:

Make sure to choose the correct platform version. 

If you meet difficutly with spinner, try to get the sample code and see how it works:
