Q:By default, it seems that logcat will truncate any log message that it considers to be "too long".  This happens both inside of Eclipse and when running logcat on the command line using adb -d logcat, and is truncating some important debugging messages.  

Is there any way to increase the maximum string length supported by logcat to get it to stop truncating the debug information?  The official documentation implies that there may not be, but maybe logcat supports some additional options not mentioned there?

A:There is a fixed size buffer in logcat for binary logs (/dev/log/events) and this limit is 1024 bytes. 
For the non-binary logs there is also a limit:

#define LOGGER_ENTRY_MAX_LEN        (4*1024)
#define LOGGER_ENTRY_MAX_PAYLOAD (LOGGER_ENTRY_MAX_LEN - sizeof(struct logger_entry))


So the real message size for both binary and non-binary logs is ~4076 bytes.
The kernel logger interface imposes this LOGGER_ENTRY_MAX_PAYLOAD limit.

The liblog sources (used by logcat) also say:


  
  The message may have been truncated by the kernel log driver.
  


I would recommend you the nxlog tool which does not use the logcat binary, but due to the limitations in the kernel I doubt that it will solve your problem. Nevertheless, it might be worth a try. (disclaimer: I'm the author.)
