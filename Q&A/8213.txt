Q:I have a service that can be started and stopped from a button.

But within the service I want to register a reciever to listen for SMS broadcasts. I only want the service to listen for SMS while it is running. I tried registerReceiver(receiver, intentfilter) but this does not work. What am I doing wrong?

A:You must set permissions in the AndroidManifest file.

    <receiver android:name=".MySMSReciever"> 
        <intent-filter> 
            <action android:name=
                "android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED" /> 
        </intent-filter> 
    </receiver>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
