A:When using support library Bottom Navigation bar, its quite complex to show a badge/notification on menu items. 
However there are easy solutions to get it done. Such as 
https://github.com/aurelhubert/ahbottomnavigation

This library is more advanced version of Bottom Navigation bar. And you can set a badge on menu item simply using this code snippet. 

bottomNavigation.setNotification(notification, bottomNavigation.getItemsCount() - 1);


And you'll get following result
