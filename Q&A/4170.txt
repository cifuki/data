Q:I am developing an Android app and I'd like to start testing out push notifications.  From a code perspective, I'm all set.  My current challenge is that I simply do not know how to get a Google Cloud Messaging API key from Google.

There are loads and loads of tutorials and videos online showing how this can be done in about 10 seconds but Google has recently updated it's developer center and none of the tutorials seem to apply any more.  The current process seems very cumbersome and not at all similar to what I've seen online.

I realize that this barely passes as a programming question (if at all) but there is no way that I'm going to even begin to be able to develop anything without an API key from Google.

Is someone able to point me in the right direction?

That's yet more work for my next book update...

Bearing in mind that I am already set up with keys, and therefore may be seeing somewhat different stuff than would somebody with no keys:

Step #1: Log into https://cloud.google.com/console with your Google account

Step #2: In the navigation on the left, go into "APIs & auth > APIs"

Step #3: Find "Google Cloud Messaging for Android" and click the "OFF" button next to it (note: this might involve then agreeing to additional terms of service)

Step #4: In the navigation on the left, go into "APIs & auth > Registered apps"

Step #5: Wait a really long time, apparently.

Step #6: Click the red REGISTER APP button.

Step #7: Give the app a name and choose Web Application, then click Register

Step #8: Click the "Server Key" section for your server key
