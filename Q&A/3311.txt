Q:I'm trying to add google play services to my libGDX project in IntelliJ Idea. I've followed the setup guide here: https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup

which looks pretty straightforward. I just added those lines to my build.gradle in the corresponding section, so things look now like:

project(":android") {
    apply plugin: "android"
    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

    configurations { natives }

    dependencies {
        compile project(":core")
        compile "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-android:$gdxVersion"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi-v7a"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-arm64-v8a"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-x86"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-x86_64"
        compile "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d-platform:$gdxVersion"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi-v7a"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-x86"
        compile "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-freetype:$gdxVersion"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-freetype-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-freetype-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-armeabi-v7a"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-freetype-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-arm64-v8a"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-freetype-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-x86"
        natives "com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-freetype-platform:$gdxVersion:natives-x86_64"
        compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:11.2.0'
    }
}


Then I try to sync my gradle project in Idea just to get that "Failed to resolve" error.

Well, the setup guide also says "Be sure you update this version number each time Google Play services is updated", but the problem is that it seems nearly impossible to find that version number: my Google Play Services SDK version according to the Android SDK manager is "43", and so far I have been unable to correlate such "11.2.0" or whatever typical version string with the "43" version number. Not that the setup guide says nothing about that.

Anyway, I have tried a lot of things from the plethora of questions related to this to no avail. Specifically, I have to point out that I do have my Android SDK properly updated and I'm sure it is the one it's being used by Idea (I've already triple-checked this...):




I'm using the API level 26, but anyway the other defines do use the very same directory for the Android SDK. Moreover, I do NOT have any other android SDK installed at all in this laptop, so there's no question about Idea being using that one and that one only. 

Any ideas are more than welcome.

Thanks in advance!

A:I had the issue when I put jcenter() before google() in project level build.gradle. When I changed the order and put google() before jcenter() in build.gradle the problem disappeared

Here is my final build.gradle

// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
buildscript {

    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.3'


        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
