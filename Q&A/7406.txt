Q:I want to launch a specif application.

I know how to do Intents but I want to avoid the selection menu if there are multiple apps that can handle the intent, I want to go directly to a particular app. Hope this makes sense.

A:You use the package name / class directly, for example to create a new intent to call the twidroid program you'd use the followinglink text:

 Intent intent = new Intent("com.twidroid.SendTweet");


You'd probably want to put a try/catch around for a ActivityNotFoundException for when the application is not installed.
