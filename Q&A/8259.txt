Q:After I added some .png files into my Project Workspace drawable folder I refreshed my drawable folders in Eclipse and the newly added files showed up. But when I tried to access those resources using R.drawable.xyzimage, xyzimage although in the folder could not be resolved. 

So I did a Project Clean and guess what after this clean R.java is totally gone and all my classes accessing resources using R.java is showing all sorts of error and Eclipse won't let me run the code anymore. 

I have backup of my source code but I want to explore if R.java can be regenerated and how?

Thanks for all the help.

A:Try Project->Clean in Eclipse. In my limited experience if R.java is not being automatically created then there is an error somewhere in your xml. Triple check everything.
