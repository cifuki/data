Q:There are some conditions where my service could be attempted to be started when it should not be. In cases like this is it bad form to call stopSelf() while inside a onStartCommand() method? If so what is the best way to handle such a situation? Any resources will be greatly appreciated.

A:is it bad form to call stopSelf() while inside a onStartCommand() method?


Off the top of my head, I can't think of why that would be a problem.

stopSelf(), like a lot of stuff in Android, has no immediate effect. It puts a message on the message queue processed by the main application thread. The actual work of stopping the service will not even begin until sometime after onStartCommand() has returned.
