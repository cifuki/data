Q:I've found out that my R.java is never updated, so it doesn't contain information about my new resources, so I decided to delete it and thought that Eclipse would generate a new one. But that didn't happen, and I don't have R.java now. How can I regenerate one?

I'm using WindowsÂ 7. 

From one of the comments: "Doing Project -> Clean is what caused the problem for me. Cleaning deletes R.java...and for whatever reason the plugin is not regenerating the file."

A:This site suggests:


  if you run a clean on the project it should regenerate all the generated Java files, namely R. 


...and...


  In Eclipse, under the Project menu, is an option build automatically.
  That would help you build the R.java file everytime modifications are
  made. The Clean... option is also there under Project. 


This site suggests another solution.
