Q:I have just downloaded the Android SDK Command Line tools for Windows (26.0.2). I am attempting to download selected SDK components using \\tools\\bin\\sdkmanager.bat, as well as updating \\tools. The installation fails with the following message:


  Warning: An error occurred during installation: Failed to move away or delete existing target file: C:\\testinstall\\sdk\\tools
  Move it away manually and try again..


I don't see how I can remove \\tools manually because it contains \\bin\\sdkmanager.bat.

Screenshot of the sdkmanager command:



All other components appear to install without error. See below for the components specified in my package file:

A:Yeah that's quite funny. A way to do that is to copy the tools folder to another place (let's say C:\\temp\\). Then direct into the C:\\temp\\tools\\bin\\, open the cmd prompt there and run your update commands as such:

sdkmanager.bat --sdk_root=sdkRootPath --command


Where sdkRootPath is path to your original SDK folder (C:\\testinstall\\sdk\\). Once that is done, delete the C:\\temp\\tools\\ copied folder.
