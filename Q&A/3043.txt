A:I'll explain it in an easy way with steps:


First, you have install MAT ( download ) or use:


  brew cask install memoryanalyzer

In Android Studio open Android Device Monitor or DDMS.
Select your process "com.example.etc.."
Click Update Heap above the process list.
In the right-side panel, select the Heap tab.
Click in Cause GC.
Click Dump HPROF file above the process list.
When we downloaded the file HPROF, we have to open the Terminal and run this command to generate the file to open it with MAT.
Open terminal and run this command 



  ./hprof-conv path/file.hprof exitPath/heap-converted.hprof


The command "hprof-conv" is in the platform-tools folder of the sdk.


And ready and MAT can open and open the converted file ( heap-converted.hprof ) .
