Q:I know this question has been asked  here a few times before. But i haven't seen any possible solution yet.
Before i make the project 'Run as Android Application' , if i do not clean it, i receive the following error and have to restart Eclipse ... and clean again.

Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: Multiple dex files define
     Lcom/jstun/core/attribute/MessageAttributeInterface;


com.jstun.core... is a part of my src folder, of course i can't remove it. And even if i remove that package, another package will show up as an error like:

Unable to execute dex: Multiple dex files define
     Landroid/support/v4/app/ActivityCompatHoneycomb;


I've seen this error since updating to ADT 15, i'm using Eclipse Galileo on Ubuntu
Do you have any idea? Thanks for any reply!

A:This is a build path issue.


Make sure your bin folder is not included in your build path. 
Right click on your project -> go to properties ->  Build Path. 
Make sure that Honeycomb library is in your libs/ folder and not in your source folder. 
Include the libraries in libs/ individually in the build path. 

BTW, you may want to bring in the android-support-v4 library to get Ice Cream Sandwich support instead of the Honeycomb support library.
