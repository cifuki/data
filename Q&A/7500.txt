Q:What is the difference between Calendar.HOUR and Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY ?
When to use Calendar.HOUR and Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY ?
I am confused sometime Calendar.HOUR this works fine and othertime Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY this works fine. What they return in the form of int? 
I have read this documentation but not understood the difference.
Any suggestions
Thanks.

A:From http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#HOUR:


  Calendar.HOUR = Field number for get and set indicating the hour of the morning or afternoon. HOUR is used for the 12-hour clock. E.g., at 10:04:15.250 PM the HOUR is 10.
  
  Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY = Field number for get and set indicating the hour of the day. HOUR_OF_DAY is used for the 24-hour clock. E.g., at 10:04:15.250 PM the HOUR_OF_DAY is 22.
