A:Try putting this in your ExpandableListAdapter, listView is a reference to the ExpandableListView itself. And lastExpandedGroupPosition is a integer member variable defined inside your ExpandableListAdapter.

    @Override
    public void onGroupExpanded(int groupPosition){
        //collapse the old expanded group, if not the same
        //as new group to expand
        if(groupPosition != lastExpandedGroupPosition){
            listView.collapseGroup(lastExpandedGroupPosition);
        }

        super.onGroupExpanded(groupPosition);           
        lastExpandedGroupPosition = groupPosition;
    }
