Q:I am trying to release a new version of my app at Google Play Console.

I have one version which I didn't release and then I uploaded a new one to Beta that I want to release.

When I press on the "RELEASE TO PRODUCTION" button I get the following message:


  "To release to production, ensure that you don't have a draft release
  in production already"


If I try to "RELEASE TO PRODUCTION" the former version I get the same message. How can I break this loop? any ideas?

A:At some point you probably hit "Create release" while you were in the Production Management page then left the draft there. Go and Edit that draft and click "Discard" on it then you'll be able to move an app from Beta to Prod
