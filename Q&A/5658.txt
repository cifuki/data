Q:In several android styling tutorials parent style elements are used that i can not find in the android.R.style.* styles (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html).

A few examples are from the http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/04/customizing-action-bar.html action bar article. Nick uses parent styles like:

<style name="MyDropDownNav" parent="android:style/Widget.Holo.Light.Spinner.DropDown.ActionBar">
...
</style>


or 

<style name="MyActionBarTabStyle" parent="android:style/Widget.Holo.Light.ActionBarView_TabView">
...
</style>


Where do these parent styles come from? Is it possible to list all available parent styles?

Thanks.

A:As stated in the "Applying Styles and Themes" article:


  The Android platform provides a large collection of styles and themes
  that you can use in your applications. You can find a reference of all
  available styles in the R.style class. To use the styles listed here,
  replace all underscores in the style name with a period. For example,
  you can apply the Theme_NoTitleBar theme with 
  "@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar".
  
  The R.style reference, however, is not well documented and does not
  thoroughly describe the styles, so viewing the actual source code for
  these styles and themes will give you a better understanding of what
  style properties each one provides. For a better reference to the
  Android styles and themes, see the following source code:  
  
  
  Android Styles (styles.xml)  
  Android Themes (themes.xml)
  
  
  These files will help you learn through example. For instance, in the
  Android themes source code, you'll find a declaration for <style
  name="Theme.Dialog">. In this definition, you'll see all of the
  properties that are used to style dialogs that are used by the Android
  framework.
