Q:I am importing a project. It comes with errors in last activity file and these are the following entries in console:

[2013-04-04 12:00:59 - AndroidFragment] Unable to resolve target 'android-15'
[2013-04-04 12:10:31 - AndroidFragment] Unable to resolve target 'android-15'


I have fixed project setup and select the available target version by clicking on:

Project > Properties > Android > Project Build Target > Version 


But nothing happens.

A:Right click on your project.
Go to Properties.
Choose Android on the left side.
On the right, you can see a list of Android API versions. Choose the proper version (Android API 15).
Click Apply.


If you don't see the proper version, click on the Window menu, go to Android SDK Manager and download Android API 15 (Android 4.0.3). Repeat the steps above.

In the picture below, you can see API 16; not 15. You can download API 15 using Android SDK Manager. If you already have it, click the check box next to Android 4.0.3, click Apply and then OK. 



To download an SDK from the SDK manager in Eclipse, click on the Window menu, Android SDK Manager. You should see the following window. Check Android 4.0.3 which is API 15, and click Install.
