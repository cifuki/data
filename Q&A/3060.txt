Q:I have successfully rooted my Samsung Galaxy Mini (android 2.2.1) and thought, that I could change anything (as root usually can). 

I would like to change the hosts file on the android, to include some local addresses. However, I still get the message that I do not have permission to do that. I tried following options:


adb push /path/to/my/new/hosts /system/etc ... and  I got the response Read-only file system.
directly in the shell on the phone. But this didn't work either. I can do su in the console, but cannot change the file. 


Isn't it strange, that as super user I am not allowed to change some files?

A:You have root, but you still need to remount /system to be read/write

$ adb shell
$ su
$ mount -o rw,remount -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system


Go here for more information: Mount a filesystem read-write.
