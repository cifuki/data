Q:I am currently building a horizontal gallery of videos.

I'd like to make something like that with only one video centered and part of previous and next videos:


I first opted for a Gallery but its limitations made me look for something else. I'd like to show a page indicator and it is quite difficult to implement using a Gallery.

The second option was to go for a ViewPager from Android Compatibility library. I found a way to implement a page indicator over it. But now, how to partly show left and right pages?

A:I used a negative page margin to partly show the next and the previous pages. The fading edge property can be used to make previous/next page fade:

ViewPager examplePager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.exampleView);
examplePager.setPageMargin(-50);
examplePager.setHorizontalFadingEdgeEnabled(true);
examplePager.setFadingEdgeLength(30);


The lastest support package (revision 4, October 2011) is also required for this to work
