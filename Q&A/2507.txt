Q:I have a fragment in an activity that I am using as a navigation drawer.  It contains buttons that when clicked start new activities (startActivity from a fragment simply calls startActivity on the current activity).

For the life of me I can't seem to figure out how I would finish the current activity after starting a new one.

I am looking to achieve something like this in the fragment:

@Override
public void onClick(View view) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    if (view == mButtonShows) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(view.getContext(), MyNewActivity.class);
        intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
        startActivity(intent);
        finish();
    } 
}


But it seems Fragment.class does not implement finish() (like it implements startActivity(...)).

I would like the activity backstack cleared when they launch the 2nd activity. (so pressing back from the new activity would technically drop them back to the launcher)

A:When working with fragments, instead of using this or refering to the context, always use getActivity(). You should call

getActivity().finish();


to finish your activity from fragment.
