Q:I just recently launched an application on the Google Play Store, and I was exploring the developer console and saw the tab for Crashes and ANR.

What does ANR stand for?

Also, my app seems to have crashed on some of my friend's phone before, but there was no way for them to "report" such crashes. How should I enable such functions for users to report crashes for me to see in the developer console under the Crashes/ANR tab?

A:ANR stands for Application Not Responding.  If your app is doing a lot of work on the UI thread then you'll see one of those force close/wait dialogs.  That's ANR.

As for crash reporting, if your app is distributed through Google Play then crash reporting is built in.  When your app crashes, the user will get a dialog with the options "Force Close" or "Report."  The user has to press the Report option to send you the crash report, otherwise you may never know.

If you're not distributing through Google Play, you might want to consider a library like ACRA which will email you crash reports, upload them to a Google Docs spreadsheet, or you can write your own custom handler for dealing with crash reports.  

Details about ACRA can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/acra/

Below is a sampling of what these dialogs look like.  Close/report dialogs on the left and ANR on the right.  Android 3.0+ is on top with the older dialogs on the bottom.
