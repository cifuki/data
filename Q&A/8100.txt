Q:I'm using Android Studio (Beta) 0.8.7 and my logcat has been working fine for months. All of a sudden my logcat is unable to detect any app or package names. This means I cannot filter the messages for the particular app I'm testing which is very annoying. Typical logcat messages now look like this:



Notice the question mark (?) where the app/package name should be...

Originally I thought it was my device but I've tried it with another android device that I own and I get the same issue. This is what I've tried:


Restarting Android Studio and my computer
Killing and starting the ADB server from the terminal
Restarting the devices


Has anyone experienced this before? Help please as it is driving me a little crazy...

UPDATE: I tried my laptop which has android studio installed and it is doing the same thing! I'm about 95% sure that the app/package name should be there instead of the question mark because that's the way I remember it. Also with a question mark the logcat is unable to filter messages by the app's package name...I never had this problem in the past so it must have been working so I can't be going crazy...

A:Same problem here with Android Studio 1.0 RC2. The Device Monitor shows the application name but in Android Studio's logcat panel, the package name is always a question mark.

I fixed the problem by Checking Tools / Android / Enable ADB Integration and then restarting adb.

A simpler way to is to Debug any app, if ADB integration is disabled, Android Studio will prompt you to enable. 


  You have to enable ADB integration to launch debugging. Do you want to do that?


Click Yes, of course.
