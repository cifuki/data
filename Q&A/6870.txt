Q:I've been diving into Android development for a while, and now I want to use some project (helpshift) in my app. On the website they have some example apps in which the readme says: Run the following inside the /HelpshiftDemo folder.

android update project -t android-17 -p .


So I do this, but unfortunately this gives me an error saying -bash: android: command not found. I understand this, because "android" as such doesn't refer to anything on my laptop (Mac OSX). So I thought it is maybe referring to the adb. So I tried replacing android for the direct path to my adb:

/Users/kramer65/dev/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20130917/sdk/platform-tools/adb update project -t android-17 -p .


This gives me a humongous output with more information on adb, which is I guess not the expected result.

So my questions; what does android refer to, and how can I fix this on Mac OSX?

A:The android tool is located in the tools directory in your SDK. You need to add this to your PATH environment variable so that bash can recognize it.

You can do this by adding it to your PATH in your .bash_profile file. This file should be located in your home directory. Create if it doesn't exist using vi .bash_profile and add the following line to it:

export PATH=<path_to_android_sdk>/platform-tools:<path_to_android_sdk>/tools:$PATH


where <path_to_android_sdk> is to be replaced with the path to your SDK. For example: "/Users/me/android-sdk-mac_86/platform-tools"
