Q:I'm trying to run an ionic app on my mobile phone (Android 4.4.2).
USB-Debugging is activated.

When i run the command "ionic emulate android" everything works fine and the app is opend in the emulator.

But when I run the commad "ionic run android" I get following warning:

WARNING : No target specified, deploying to emulator

and the app is started on the virtual device...

Shouldn't the app run on my mobile phone? What am I doing wrong?
How can I specify the target?

P.S.: When I copy the .apk file to the phone I can run the app.

A:I had another developer tool opened (Chrome Inspect) and it "ate" the connection. In my case, just closing the Chrome Inspect panel and running ionic run android worked.
