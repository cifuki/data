Q:I have a vertical sliding drawer at the bottom of my app. When the soft keyboard opens, it pushes the tab for the drawer up, so it sits atop the keyboard. I actually want it to remain at the bottom of the screen, becoming hidden when the keyboard is shown. 

Anyone else run into this issue? Know how to fix it?

A:You can simply switch your Activity's windowSoftInputModeflag to adjustPan in your AndroidMainfest.xml file inside your activity tag.

Check the official documentation for more info.

<activity
   ...
   android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"> 
</activity>
