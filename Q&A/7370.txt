Q:For some reason my onPostExecute() is not called after my AsyncTask finishes.

My class decleration:

public class setWallpaperForeground extends AsyncTask<String, Integer, Boolean>

My onPostExecute():

protected void onPostExecute(Boolean result)

Everything works fine, my doInBackground() completes successfully and returns a Boolean but then it just finishes.

Thanks

A:Did you create your AsyncTask on the UI thread? Also add an @Override annotaiton on your onPostExecute() method to make sure you declared it correctly.
