Q:I've try to search and found this link, but Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D doesn't work.

I also use find Action Ctrl+Shift+A to find action about diagram and uml but found nothing.

I also search for the uml plugin,
but most of them didn't work with new version of intelliJ (I didn't try it I just read the comment).

A:I found a free plugin that can generate class diagrams with android studio.
It's called SimpleUML.

Update Android Studio 2.2+:
To install the plugin, follow steps in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/36823007/1245894

Older version of Android Studio
On Mac: go to Android Studio -> Preferences -> Plugins

On Windows: go to Android Studio -> File -> Settings -> Plugins

Click on Browse repositories... and search for SimpleUMLCE 
(CE means Community Edition, this is what android studio is based on).

Install it, restart, then you can do a right click on the folder containing the classes you want to visualize, and select Add to simpleUML Diagram.

That's it; you have you fancy class diagram generated from your code!
