Q:After updating Android Studio to 0.2.4 I can't get my project to deploy. There is a complete mismatch of the apk filename.

Waiting for device.
Target device: 0146B0020E010020
Uploading file
    local path: /home/martin/workspace/git/projectname/projectname/project/build/classes/debug/AppName.apk
    remote path: /data/local/tmp/com.xxx.xxx.android.projectname
Local path doesn't exist.


After reading some posts here, I changed the output path to the build/apk folder, but the issue remains. Instead of the created projectname-debug-unaligned.apk he is looking for the projectname.apk and I have no idea how and where I can tell him to change the name he is looking for. Any ideas?

PS: Yes I have read several posts which are shown in the list on the right side. The restart of the IDE worked for my coworker, but not for me.

Edit:

I stumbled from one issue to the next so I reverted back to the only downloadable version I could find: 0.2.0.

No disappearing UI elements, I can create new projects and, best of all, I can finally deploy the APK from the studio to my device again. I will try 0.2.5 as soon as it is released.

A:I originally saw this error after upgrading from 0.2.13 to 0.3. These instructions have been updated for the release of Android Studio 0.5.2. These are the steps I completed to resolve the issue.

1.In build.gradle make sure gradle is set to 0.9.0

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.9.0'
    }
}


2.In gradle-wrapper.properties make sure to use gradle 1.11

#Wed Apr 10 15:27:10 PDT 2013
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=http\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.11-all.zip


3.Sync project with gradle files by pressing the button to the left of the avd button



4.Try to build project again. If still having issues possibly try File > Invalidate Caches/Restart

NOTE: If you are using 0.9.+ and it gives Could not GET 'http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/android/tools/build/gradle/'. Received status code 401 from server: Unauthorized (happens sporadically) then change to 0.9.0. Also, you have to use build tools 19.0 or greater I believe so make sure you have those downloaded in sdk manager and use as buildToolsVersion in whichever gradle file holds that info.
