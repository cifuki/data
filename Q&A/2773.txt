Q:I would like to have an app include a custom font for rendering text, load it, and then use it with standard elements like StaticText. Is this possible?

A:Yes you can, you jsut can't define it into xml layouts. You need to use it dynamically each time. Check this tutorial for instance.

In case link is dead, here is a sum up of the stuff :  


Get a font file like times.otf
Drop it in your asset folder, inside a "fonts" folder
Get a reference of TextView with something like that:

TextView tv = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.myCustomTVFont);

Grab you font from the asset folder:

Typeface tf = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(), "fonts/times.otf");

Make your TextView look great:

tv.setTypeface(tf);
