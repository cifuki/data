Q:I have a library and a Android app using Gradle and Android Studio. I can include the library directly in the project as following

compile project(':library')


Because I don't want to mesh up with library source code, I want to publish the library into local repository so that I can use as

compile 'com.mygroup:library:1.0'


Any advise?

A:I just found a solution. In the build.gradle of the library project, add this

apply plugin: 'maven'

group = 'com.mygroup'
version = '1.0'

uploadArchives {
    repositories {
        mavenDeployer {
            repository(url: "file://[your local maven path here]")
            // or repository(url: mavenLocal().getUrl()) 
        }
    }
}


In the project folder, type following command

gradle uploadArchives
