Q:I'm trying to upgrade the Android SDK tools from revision 15 to revision 16. The update fails, claiming that a "folder failed to be moved":


  Failed to rename directory C:\\android-sdk\\tools to
  C:\\android-sdk\\temp\\ToolPackage.old01


I tried disabling my antivirus (as this problem has been reported by some people in 2009), and it didn't work. A fresh reboot didn't work, either. I'm encountering this problem on two different Windows 7 machines.

I did not encounter this problem upgrading from previous revisions all the way up to revision 15.

Anybody knows how I can circumvent this?

A:Extracted from here:


  INSTRUCTIONS:
  
  
  make a copy of the tools directory and call this new directory tools2.
  DO NOT USE 'SDK Setup.exe'.  
  Instead open up a cmd.exe window as administrator and run the following from this new tools2 directory (obviously the full path on your local machine
  will be different):
  J:\\android-sdk-windows>tools2\\android.bat update sdk
  
  
  Basically, as noted before in this thread, 'SDK Setup.exe' invokes
  tools\\android.bat, which makes it impossible for it to rename the
  tools directory thereafter.  It's a bit goofy and should never have
  passed QA validation..
