Q:I'm trying to register my android app following the steps in  https://developers.google.com/console/help/#installed_applications which leads me to follow 
http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html.

However, I'm not sure how to get the signing certificate fingerprint (SHA1). 

I first used the Eclipse ADT plugin to export and create the keystore/key.
Then, I tried doing keytool -list keystore mykeystore.keystore and it gives me a MD5 Certificate fingerprint.  Do I need to redo the signing (meaning I can't use the eclipse export wizard)? 

Can I use a debug certificate first?

A:Start an export process to create an apk for your app and use your production key. The very last page displays both your SHA1 and MD5 certificate fingerprints
