Q:I have a annoying problem with @Override annotations in Eclipse. Often when i import working projects on a new PC, Eclipse marks some of the @Override annotations as wrong. If i remove the annotations everything is fine and Eclipse also indicates that the methods are overriding the parents methods but adding the Override annotation causes the error again. I am currently working on an Android project so it might be a problem with Android and not with Eclipse..

A:This is most likely because you are switching between Java 1.5 and Java 1.6.  In 1.5 you couldn't mark interface implementations with @Override, but you can in 1.6.

A quick Google search turned up this good explanation of the difference in this annotation between the two versions: http://www.techienuggets.com/CommentDetail?tx=38155


  Semantics of @Override is different in
  JDK 1.5 and JDK 1.6. In JDK 1.5,  the
  @Override annotation is not allowed
  for implementations of methods 
  declared in an interface, while they
  are allowed in JDK 1.6. For more
  information, see:

  It is fact that the description of the
  Override annotation was not  updated
  in the JDK API docs. This has been
  reported as a bug:
