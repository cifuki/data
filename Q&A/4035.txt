Q:When I import an Eclipse project into Android Studio, I got this problem:

Gradle 'XNote' project refresh failed
    Error:Could not determine the class-path for interface com.android.builder.model.AndroidProject.

Anyone knows why it happened? Thanks!

A:Just now i am facing the same problem.

1.Check classpath in build.gradle file.
change to


  classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.0'



then go to gradle-wrapper.properties, and change distributionUrl



  distributionUrl=http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.3-all.zip


and then rebuild the project. its help for me...
