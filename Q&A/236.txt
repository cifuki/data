Q:How do you get the text of a TextView to be Justified (with text flush on the left- and right- hand sides)? 

I found a possible solution here, but it does not work (even if you change vertical-center to center_vertical, etc).

A:I do not believe Android supports full justification.

UPDATE 2018-01-01: Android 8.0+ supports justification modes with TextView.
