Q:I am writing an Android application which uses several 3D models. Such a model with textures can take up a lot of memory. I found out the manufacturer sets a limit on the heap size an application can use. For example my tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 P7310 can take up 64MB of memory.

Is there a way to increase this size of memory an application can use?

A:You can use android:largeHeap="true" to request a larger heap size, but this will not work on any pre Honeycomb devices. On pre 2.3 devices, you can use the VMRuntime class, but this will not work on Gingerbread and above.

The only way to have as large a limit as possible is to do memory intensive tasks via the NDK, as the NDK does not impose memory limits like the SDK.

Alternatively, you could only load the part of the model that is currently in view, and load the rest as you need it, while removing the unused parts from memory. However, this may not be possible, depending on your app.
