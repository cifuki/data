A:You need to set the paint object to FILL

Paint paint = new Paint();
paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);


Then you can draw whatever you want, and it will be filled.

canvas.drawCircle(20, 20, 15, paint);
canvas.drawRectangle(60, 20, 15, paint);


etc.

For more complex shapes you need to use the PATH object.
