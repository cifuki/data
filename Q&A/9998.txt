Q:I am using the TabHost in my application, I am using four Tabs in my application and I want to use the different Images in the TabHost when the Particular Tab is been Selected and not selected. I need to use to different Images for a particular tab each. 

When I Select any Tab the Image is little bright and when I switch to another Tab that bright Image becomes grey shaded. 

I have implemented the TabHost but I don know how to change the Images in the TabHost.

Can anybody help me in this.

Thanks,
david

A:If you wish to use different images for the selected and unselected states, then create 'selector' XML files in your drawables folder for each tab, e.g. tab1_selector.xml, tab2_selector.xml which should contain the following, replacing the drawable references to your images for selected and unselected states. i.e.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item
    android:state_selected="true"
    android:drawable="@drawable/tab1_selected_image" />
  <item
    android:state_selected="false"
    android:drawable="@drawable/tab2_unselected_image" />
</selector>


Then using the .setIndicator method as bharath wrote above you should reference your new xml drawable resource.
