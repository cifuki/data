Q:Google has just implemented a new look to their tabs in Google Play.

I know this can be done with ViewPagerIndicator, yet I wouldn't like to use another library in my application and bump the app's size by another MB or so.

I am currently using the android.support.v4.view.PagerTabStrip (like in the old Google Play), and I'm wondering if the new look can also be implemented using the android support library.

Thanks in advance.

A:Design Support Library (current method).

The Design Support Library includes the TabLayout widget which allows you to implement a Google Play-lie tabs:

<android.support.design.widget.TabLayout
    android:id="@+id/tabs"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />


and then initializing it:

TabLayout tabLayout = (TabLayout) findViewById(R.id.tabs);
tabLayout.setupWithViewPager(viewPager);


For a full example see the Cheesesquare app

PagerSlidingTabStrip Library

This is a ready-to-use library that you can find on Github.
