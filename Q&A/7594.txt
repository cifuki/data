Q:Is there an easy way to simulate low memory inside the emulator ?
I'm interested to perform resource cleanups similar to this post

A:Invoke ulimit command from the shell.  

ulimit -Sv 10000


This will set current memory limit to 10 000 Kb, so that all apps invoked from this shell afterwards won't be able to access more memory.
