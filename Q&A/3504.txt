Q:I'm currently trying to adapt my application to the new permissions model of Android M.

I'm collecting all the permissions I require, then run

Log.i("Permissions", "Requesting permissions: " + permissions);
requestPermissions(requiredPermissions.toArray(new String[requiredPermissions.size()]), requestCodeForPermissions);


requiredPermissions holds the permissions I need like android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.

That routine is definitely executed as I have the Log line in the logcat:

08-07 12:52:46.469: I/Permissions(1674): Requesting permissions: android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED; android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE


But the permissions dialog never shows, let alone is onRequestPermissionsResult() called.

What am I doing wrong? Based on some tutorials I found I'm not missing anything.
I only have the emulator for testing, no physical device. This is the about screen from settings:

It might be worth mentioning something else: If I try to open the overview of installed apps from the home screen I only get launcher3 has exited. I'm not sure if that might be related.

Does anybody have an idea why it's not showing?

A:I experienced the same issue but later I realized I forgot to add the permission to the manifest file. After adding the uses-permission tag, the system showed the dialog. Maybe helps someone.
