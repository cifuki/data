Q:I want to create an application based on bluetooth operation in android.I am using the following code

 BluetoothAdapter adapter=BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();


the adapter is returning null value, which means the android emulator is not having bluetooth capability. i am using android 2.1 the latest version of android.Anybody knows how to use the bluetooth from android emulator, please help me.

A:You can't. The emulator does not support Bluetooth, as mentioned in the SDK's docs and on several other places.

And you already discovered this yourself: "the adapter is returning null value, which means the android emulator is not having bluetooth capability"
