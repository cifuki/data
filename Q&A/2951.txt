Q:We all know about the Android Activity's life cycle and Fragment's life cycles. But is there anything equivalent for views ?

This could help, for instance, building custom views or give an in-depth look at a very common and often hidden graphic operation on Android.

Thanks in advance !

A:It isn't an official document, but this recently came up on Google+. The comments also have a good discussion with some detailed explanation.
