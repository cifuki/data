Q:I have followed the instructions here: 

The developers of this app have not set up this app properly for Facebook Login?

Made my app public and the circle is green so the app is public.

But when I try to login, I go to the Facebook app, it asks me to login which I do and then I get this message:

App Not Setup: This app is still in development mode, and you don't have access to it. Switch to a registered test user or ask an app admin for permissions.

BTW: I am the admin

Any help is much appreciated. I am using SeattleClouds and this happens on both iOS and android.
