Q:I'm trying to get the sample code of Android 'Google Maps Android API v2' working. I get the project built without errors. However, when I try to run the app on my Galaxy Nexus (connected with usb to my laptop), the app crashes immediately.


I filled in my own Maps API Key at the AndroidManifest.xml
I built against Android 4.1.2


This is the logging:

Unable to resolve superclass of Lcom/example/mapdemo/BasicMapActivity; (66) 
Link of class 'Lcom/example/mapdemo/BasicMapActivity;' failed

Does anybody have a hint how to solve this or what I might be doing wrong?

A:Follow the crib sheet very, very carefully:
https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19nQzvKP-CVLd7_VrpwnHfl-AE9fjbJySowONZZtNHzw

In particular, I think you need to:


Import the actual source for the "google-play-services_lib" project and link it as an Android library.

Do this through Project -> Properties -> Android -> Library, Add -> google-play-services_lib (you can right click on your project and choose Properties, then select Android).  
Do not add it as a dependent Project through the "Java Build Path" for your project, that didn't work for me.

Add the google-play-services.jar and android-support-v4.jar into a "libs" folder in the sample project, and add them as "External External JARs" in "Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Libraries".


I found this second step was necessary as I was hitting the exact same error as you when trying to use the sample code.  The first step was necessary to avoid a NoClassDefFoundError in com.google.android.gms.R$styleable in my real project. 

I also needed to do a Clean build and Uninstall the app from the device (from an earlier test attempt) before the sample code worked.
