Q:This my project: https://github.com/kenpeter/my_hak_news, which is a direct copy of https://github.com/grigio/HAgnostic-News.

Git clone https://github.com/kenpeter/my_hak_news, then run react-native run-android

Got this error:

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:installDebug'.
> com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: com.android.ddmlib.InstallException: Failed to finalize session : INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE: Package com.hagnosticnews signatures do not match the previously installed version; ignoring!


Relevant issue: https://github.com/grigio/HAgnostic-News/issues/1, I follow various ways, but not able to resolve this issue.

A:You need to uninstall it because you are using a different signature than the original. If it is not working it might be because it is still installed for another user on the device. To completely uninstall, go to Settings -> Apps -> HAgnostic News -> Options (the three dots on top right) -> Uninstall for all users
