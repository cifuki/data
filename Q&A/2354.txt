Q:I rarely do something for Android so I'm a bit confused. While back there were two type of installations - Android Studio and just Android SDK. I have IDEA so I don't need Studio. Typically I download SDK that have UI tool to download its components.

I just got https://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.3-linux.zip and I can't see UI SDK Manager in it. There is bin/sdkmanager shell script. But it's kinda inconvenient for my purpose because going through output of --list, copy-pasting packages names and running sdkmanager would take too much time.

What's the way of installing this quickly now ?

PS. I'm on Ubuntu 16.10 in case it matters.

PS2. I just tried sdkmanager "platforms;android-25" as per documentation but it gave no output after me agreeing to terms. Where did it install SDK files? Did it even install it? Amazing.

A:Looks like I'm not the only one who had to deal with this idiocy. The way to install it


Unpack zip to some /parent folder so it has /parent/tools. I extracted content of zip's tools to /androidsdk and it was mistake. Script couldn't find it.
Set ANDROID_HOME to /parent folder.
Run /parent/tools/android sdk to see SDK Manager's GUI.


Google, was it hard to leave script that does the above in installation zip so people don't need to waste 40 minutes googling around ?
