Q:I have a ListView which displays news items. They contain an image, a title and some text. The image is loaded in a separate thread (with a queue and all) and when the image is downloaded, I now call notifyDataSetChanged() on the list adapter to update the image. This works, but getView() is getting called too frequently, since notifyDataSetChanged() calls getView() for all visible items. I want to update just the single item in the list. How would I do this?

Problems I have with my current approach are:


Scrolling is slow
I have a fade-in animation on the image which happens every time a single new image in the list is loaded.

A:I found the answer, thanks to your information Michelle.
You can indeed get the right view using View#getChildAt(int index). The catch is that it starts counting from the first visible item. In fact, you can only get the visible items. You solve this with ListView#getFirstVisiblePosition().

Example:

private void updateView(int index){
    View v = yourListView.getChildAt(index - 
        yourListView.getFirstVisiblePosition());

    if(v == null)
       return;

    TextView someText = (TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.sometextview);
    someText.setText("Hi! I updated you manually!");
}
