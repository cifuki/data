Q:My guess it that the lightweight notifications in Android are called Toast because they popup like toast from a toaster.  Can anyone confirm this or provide a better explanation?  I am teaching a course on Android development and would like to edit the wiki, so I want to be sure to get it right.

A:Quoting wikipedia : 


  An ex-Microsoft employee of Google is
  credited with coining the term during
  the development of MSN Messenger,
  since Messenger's small notification
  windows slide upward into view, like
  toast popping out of a toaster
