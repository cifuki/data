Q:I've got an activity that I've replaced with a fragment.  The activity took an Intent that had some extra information on what data the activity was supposed to display.

Now that my Activity is just a wrapper around a Fragment that does the same work, how do I get that bundle to the Fragment if I declare the fragment in XML with the  tag?

If I were to use a FragmentTransaction to put the Fragment into a ViewGroup, I'd get a chance to pass this info along in the Fragment constructor, but I'm wondering about the situation where the fragment is defined in XML.

You can't.

However, you are welcome to call findFragmentById() on your FragmentManager to retrieve the fragment post-inflation, then call some method on the fragment to associate data with it. While apparently that cannot be setArguments(), your fragment could arrange to hold onto the data itself past a configuration change by some other means (onSaveInstanceState(), setRetainInstance(true), etc.).
