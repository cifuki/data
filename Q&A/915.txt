Q:I have a xml-layout file main with two textviews A/B and a view C.
I have two other xml-layout files option1 and option2.
Is it possible to load either option1 or option2 in run time via Java into C? If so, what function do I have to use?

A:You could replace any view at any time.

int optionId = someExpression ? R.layout.option1 : R.layout.option2;

View C = findViewById(R.id.C);
ViewGroup parent = (ViewGroup) C.getParent();
int index = parent.indexOfChild(C);
parent.removeView(C);
C = getLayoutInflater().inflate(optionId, parent, false);
parent.addView(C, index);


If you don't want to replace already existing View, but choose between option1/option2 at initialization time, then you could do this easier: set android:id for parent layout and then:

ViewGroup parent = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.parent);
View C = getLayoutInflater().inflate(optionId, parent, false);
parent.addView(C, index);


You will have to set "index" to proper value depending on views structure. You could also use a ViewStub: add your C view as ViewStub and then:

ViewStub C = (ViewStub) findViewById(R.id.C);
C.setLayoutResource(optionId);
C.inflate();


That way you won't have to worry about above "index" value if you will want to restructure your XML layout.
