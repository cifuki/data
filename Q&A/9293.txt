Q:Has anyone noticed the SwipeRefreshLayout in gmail. It changes color for every rotation in a single load iteration. Does anyone have any idea how to achieve it?

A:The documentation for SwipeRefreshLayout details the setColorSchemeResources() and setColorSchemeColors() methods that can be used to set the color scheme of your SwipeRefreshLayout

The docs state:


  Set the color resources used in the progress animation from color resources. The first color will also be the color of the bar that grows in response to a user swipe gesture.


You should note that setColorSchemeColors() should be used with specific colour values and setColorSchemeResources() should be used when you intend to use resource references to colours (e.g. R.color.red).

Please also note that setColorScheme(), the old way of completing this, is now deprecated.
