Q:In order to make a simple game, I used a template that draws a canvas with bitmaps like this:

private void doDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    for (int i=0;i<8;i++)
        for (int j=0;j<9;j++)
            for (int k=0;k<7;k++)   {
    canvas.drawBitmap(mBits[allBits[i][j][k]], i*50 -k*7, j*50 -k*7, null); } }


(The canvas is defined in "run()" / the SurfaceView lives in a GameThread.)

My first question is how do I clear (or redraw) the whole canvas for a new layout?
Second, how can I update just a part of the screen? 

// This is the routine that calls "doDraw":
public void run() {
    while (mRun) {
        Canvas c = null;
        try {
            c = mSurfaceHolder.lockCanvas(null);
            synchronized (mSurfaceHolder) {
                if (mMode == STATE_RUNNING) 
                    updateGame();
                doDraw(c);          }
        } finally {
            if (c != null) {
                mSurfaceHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(c);  }   }   }       }

A:How do I clear (or redraw) the WHOLE canvas for a new layout (= try at the game) ?


Just call Canvas.drawColor(Color.BLACK), or whatever color you want to clear your Canvas with.


  And: how can I update just a part of the screen ?


There is no such method that just update a "part of the screen" since Android OS is redrawing every pixel when updating the screen. But, when you're not clearing old drawings on your Canvas, the old drawings are still on the surface and that is probably one way to "update just a part" of the screen.

So, if you want to "update a part of the screen", just avoid calling Canvas.drawColor() method.
