Q:Android Studio 2.0 Preview 4


I am using to use BringToFront to get a TextView to display in front of the other controls.

The Doc's bringToFront() say you have to call requestlayout invalidate. Which I do, but doesn't work.

tvLevel.bringToFront();
tvLevel.requestLayout();
tvLevel.invalidate();


I am using this TextView inside a android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout

However, the following code does work. But only supports API 21 and above. But I need to support API 16.

  if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
      tvLevel.setTranslationZ(4);
      tvLevel.invalidate();
  }


Or by setting the xml attribute property android:translationZ("4dp") works. However, only for API 21

     * Change the view's z order in the tree, so it's on top of other sibling
     * views. This ordering change may affect layout, if the parent container
     * uses an order-dependent layout scheme (e.g., LinearLayout). Prior
     * to {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT} this
     * method should be followed by calls to {@link #requestLayout()} and
     * {@link View#invalidate()} on the view's parent to force the parent to redraw
     * with the new child ordering.
     *
     * @see ViewGroup#bringChildToFront(View)

    public void bringToFront() {
        if (mParent != null) {
            mParent.bringChildToFront(this);
        }
    }


according to this  You may missing the line:

((View)myView.getParent()).requestLayout();


and it will work, Check it out.!
