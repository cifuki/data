Q:I want to install a file using the Windows command line. First I want to build after compiling all the .jar files to create an .apk file for an Android application without using Eclipse.

Does anyone know how this can be done without the use of Eclipse & only by making use of command line.

A:You can use the code below to install application from command line

adb install example.apk


this apk is installed in the internal memory of current opened emulator.

adb install -s example.apk


this apk is installed in the sd-card of current opened emulator.

You can also install an apk to specific device in connected device list to the adb.

adb -s emulator-5554 install myapp.apk


Refer also to adb help for other options.
