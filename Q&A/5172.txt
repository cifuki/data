Q:I'm not very experienced with Maven in combination with Android yet, so I followed these instructions to make a new Android project. When the project has been created, I get the following error message: 


  Project 'xxx-1.0-SNAPSHOT' is missing required source folder:
  'src/test/java'


When I try to add a new source folder with New->Other->Java-Source Folder with src/test/java, I get another error message:


  The folder is already a source folder.


But I don't have any src/test/java folder in my project. How should I deal with that? What's the clean way to setup the project, because I assume that there is something missing in this instruction. So what is the Maven way to let src/test/java appear?

I'm using Eclipse Juno, m2e 1.1.0, Android Configuration for m2e 0.4.2.

A:I realise this annoying thing too since latest m2e-android plugin upgrade (version 0.4.2), it happens in both new project creation and existing project import (if you don't use src/test/java).

It looks like m2e-android (or perhaps m2e) now always trying to add src/test/java as a source folder, regardless of whether it is actually existed in your project directory, in the .classpath file:

<classpathentry kind="src" output="bin/classes" path="src/test/java">
  <attributes>
    <attribute name="maven.pomderived" value="true"/>
  </attributes>
</classpathentry>


As it is already added in the project metadata file, so if you trying to add the source folder via Eclipse, Eclipse will complain that the classpathentry is already exist:



There are several ways to fix it, the easiest is manually create src/test/java directory in the file system, then refresh your project by press F5 and run Maven -> Update Project (Right click project, choose Maven -> Update Project...), this should fix the missing required source folder: 'src/test/java' error.
