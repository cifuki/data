Q:This is not like other questions:

I already have installed:


ADT
Samsung Kies 3 (because I have a Samsung Galaxy S5)
Google USB Driver


I already have configured:


Developer options in my device enabled
USB Debugging enabled


My computer and Kies recognizes my device, but adb doesn't!

I'm using Windows 7 Professional 64-bits

Could anyone help me, please?

A:The problem was that windows does not recognize the device driver, therefore is needed install it manually. The way I solved this:

1. Open Device Manager and locate your device under \xe2\x80\x9cOther devices\xe2\x80\x9d.


2. Right click on your device and then click on \xe2\x80\x9cUpdate driver software\xe2\x80\x9d.

3. Now click on \xe2\x80\x9cBrowse my computer for driver software\xe2\x80\x9d option.


4. In next screen, click on the option \xe2\x80\x9cLet me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\xe2\x80\x9d.

5. Now select \xe2\x80\x9cShow All Devices\xe2\x80\x9d option and click the next button.



6. Now click on \xe2\x80\x9cHave Disk\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d button. A window will pop up, click the browse button and browse to following location: D:\\android-sdk-windows\\extras\\google\\usb_driver and select android_winusb.inf file.

Note: If you installed / extracted the Android SDK to a different location, browse to that location instead of D:\\

7. In next screen, select \xe2\x80\x9cAndroid Composite ADB Interface\xe2\x80\x9d and click the \xe2\x80\x9cNext\xe2\x80\x9d button.



8. Confirm installation by clicking \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cInstall\xe2\x80\x9d if you see any warning messages appear in Windows.

9. Android ADB drivers on Windows will now be installed for your device. You will see a confirmation message.
