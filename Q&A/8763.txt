Q:I've done some tests while integrating the new Google Play Games with fake scores, now I need to reset the leaderboards before publishing my game!

I found this REST API:
https://developers.google.com/games/services/management/api/?hl=en#Scores

But this seems to be related only to web games, not Android games:
"Use the Google Play game services REST API to set and retrieve game services data from your web game"

Thanks!

A:I ended up switching all my leaderboards in the Developer Console to use "lowest scores are best" instead of the previous "highest scores are best" and this seems to have reset the old scores that were saved. It's a bit of a hack but very useful. You could probably switch back again and everything would still be cleared.
