Q:I have recently shifted to android studio. I would like to know how I can test my apps in Bluestacks app player. I had already had the bluestacks connected and working with eclipse using adb connect localhost:5555 but it doesn't seem to work with android studio. Didn't find any help anywhere. If anyone has done this, please help.

A:Steps to connect Blue Stack with Android Studio


Close Android Studio.
Go to adb.exe location (default location: %LocalAppData%\\Android\\sdk\\platform-tools)
Run adb connect localhost:5555 from this location.
Start Android Studio and you will get Blue Stack as emulator when you run your app.
