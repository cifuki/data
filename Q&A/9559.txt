Q:I usually create projects with Eclipse and import them into Android Studio, because I hate the project structure AS gives me. In it\xc2\xb4s module settings, I have the possibility to create artifacts which allow me to output the built apk to a certain path.



Now I have created a Gradle project directly with AS and it seems that those projects have quite less options than eclipse projects. I don\xc2\xb4t find anything to output my apk and I don\xc2\xb4t find any apk inside my project folder after building.



How do I get my unsigned apk out of the build process??

A:Use 

Build > Make Project


to build an apk file from Android Studio.

You can get your unsigned apk under the below path

$YOUR_PROJECT/$YOUR_MODULE/build/apk


unsigned apk files will have "unsigned" text in their names.

[ UPDATE ] : 

In Recent release of Android Studio you will not get apk file on sysncing or Make Project. There are two other methods in order to get the apk file


Run the app
Execute assemble Task from Gradle panel present in right hand side of Studio window or from embedded terminal window on bottom(in project Root)


gradlew assembleDebug(or whatever build varient you want a build for)

and the update new apk path will be

$YOUR_PROJECT/$YOUR_MODULE/build/outputs/apk
