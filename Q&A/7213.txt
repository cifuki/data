Q:Chrome mobile has recently added the ability to add to home screen, similar to iOS. This is cool but it doesn't support it as well as iOS - it doesn't support window.navigator.standalone so you can't detect whether you are running as a standalone app.

The reference says:


  How can I detect if the app is running as an installed app?
  
  You can\xe2\x80\x99t, directly.


Notice it says "directly". My question is can we do it indirectly? Is there some tricky way to make an educated guess?

A:This answer comes with a huge delay, but I post it here just for other people who are struggling to find a solution.

Recently Google has implemented the CSS conditional display-mode: standalone, so there are two possible ways to detect if an app is running standalone:

Using CSS:

@media all and (display-mode: standalone) {
    /* Here goes the CSS rules that will only apply if app is running standalone */
}


Using both CSS and Javascript:

function isRunningStandalone() {
    return (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches);
}
...
if (isRunningStandalone()) {
    /* This code will be executed if app is running standalone */
}
