Q:Why do we use the sqlite data base in android.I am developing an android application where the data  is to be fetched from the server and do some data calculation and show it on the UI.

Is it good  for me to fetch the data into the sqlite DB and update the UI on regular interval from the sqlite  in evry 20 minutes or will it be good to sent the Http get request to the server and update the data from teh response on the UI.

I wanted to know which one will be better and why?Why to involve sqlite DB?
The data corresponds to some 40X40 table data on which some heavy mathematical processing is to be done and then displayed on the UI(similar to Stock market application) and data needs to be cleared   after every 12 hours.
plz advice
Rgds,
Raul

A:It is good to use database in your case.

Pros:


If your application gets closed the in memory data will be lost, but after that you will be able to restore the state from the database if you have one
Especially for the case of complex calculations it is good to store the result once in the database and not recalculate it multiple times on demand
The database will untie your UI from the internet connection and thus you will be able to display results even if there is not internet connection
Using database you will be able to fetch the updated data from a background service, without impacting your UI
Organizing your data in database usually makes it a lot easier to manage all the application data.


Cons:


Adding database will require a bit of additional effort on your side


As you can see my list proves you SHOULD use database in your case. Maybe I am biased, but at least I provide you with things to consider.
