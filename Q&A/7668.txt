Q:I am trying to use a Fragment in a FragmentActivity like so:

TutViewerFragment viewer = (TutViewerFragment)    
getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.tutview_fragment);


And my TutViewerFragment extends Fragment. However I am getting an error:


  Cannot cast from Fragment to TutViewerFragment.  


I really don't understand why this is happening.  Why can't it be cast?

A:You are extending the wrong Fragment class. Import android.support.v4.app.Fragment instead of android.app.Fragment.
