Q:I have been on this problem for a couple hours. After downloading a repository from github, the only error in any .xml file is:

No resource found that matches the given name '@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light'


The code is very straightforward, but there is not one straightforward answer I have found, on how to alleviate the error.

here is the code (in file res/values/styles.xml): 

<style name="AppBaseTheme" parent="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light">
    <!-- API 14 theme customizations can go here. -->
</style>


The project is located at: https://github.com/erikswed/InstaChatX
I am on Windows, using Eclipse Kepler

A:What are the steps for that? where is AppCompat located?

Download the support library here:

http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html

If you are using Eclipse:

Go to the tabs at the top and select ( Windows -> Android SDK Manager ). Under the 'extras' section, check 'Android Support Library' and check it for installation.



After that, the AppCompat library can be found at:

android-sdk/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat


You need to reference this AppCompat library in your Android project.

Import the library into Eclipse.


Right click on your Android project.
Select properties.
Click 'add...' at the bottom to add a library.
Select the support library
Clean and rebuild your project.
