Q:I have a GPS app that already requests ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in the manifest, now I want to add a library (MoPub)  that requires ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION.

Am I correct in assuming that ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION is enough, and I can leave out ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION from my manifest?

A:https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/strategies.html#Permission


  Note: If you are using both NETWORK_PROVIDER and GPS_PROVIDER, then you need to request only the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission, because it includes permission for both providers. (Permission for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION includes permission only for NETWORK_PROVIDER.)


In short: yes, you don't need ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION if you've already defined ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.
