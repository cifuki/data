Q:I just try to write a bash shell for my Android Phone.
When I want list all the files in my Android Phone. I found that the Android shell terminal doesn't support find command.
So I just want to know which is the best way to travel the sdcard files?

A:I might be wrong but "find -name __" works fine for me. (Maybe it's just my phone.)
If you just want to list all files, you can try

adb shell ls -R /


You probably need the root permission though.

Edit:
As other answers suggest, use ls with grep like this:

adb shell ls -Ral yourDirectory | grep -i yourString


eg.

adb shell ls -Ral / | grep -i myfile


-i is for ignore-case. and / is the root directory.
