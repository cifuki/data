Q:Is there a way to extract and view the content of an .apk file?

A:Actually the apk file is just a zip archive, so you can try to rename the file to theappname.apk.zip and extract it with any zip utility (e.g. 7zip).

The androidmanifest.xml file and the resources will be extracted and can be viewed whereas the source code is not in the package - just the compiled .dex file ("Dalvik Executable")
