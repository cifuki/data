Q:I have been using genymoton for quite some time now.

Could someone pls. tell me if there is a way by which I can access the files present in the sd card of genymotion emulator?

Currently I have to upload them to google driver and then download on windows.

A:You can use shared folder for that. It is well explain on this Google+ post.

Here is the brief:


  
  Go to your VirtualBox VM setting / Shared folder tab
  Add a shared folder with the folder you want to shared, and check the "auto mount" option
  Start your VM as usual from the Genymotion software
  Your shared folder is available in the /mnt/shared directory (multiple shared folders are supported)
