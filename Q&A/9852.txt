Q:I will be using a local JSON file with some data. My question is where is the best/proper way to store the file and how should I access it and it's contents? 

I have worked with json through http before but not a local one.

A:There are so many ways, 


You can store your JSON file in assets folder and read them like this - https://stackoverflow.com/a/19945484/713778
You can store it in res/raw folder and read the same as show here - https://stackoverflow.com/a/6349913/713778


For basic JSON parsing, Android's in-built JSONObject should work - https://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONObject.html

For more advanced JSON parsing (json-java mapping), you can look at GSON library - https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/
