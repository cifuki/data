I need to download a web page on an android app and I am having a hard time deciding whether to use the android apache http client or java's URLConnection.

Any thoughts?

A:For most things I'd say that HttpClient is the way to go.  However there are some situations and edge cases where I'd fall back to a URLConnection.  Examples of edge cases here and  here

EDIT
A similar question has been asked before: httpclient vs httpurlconnection.  I would assume that HttpUrlConnection is somewhat faster as the HttpClient is built on top of the standard Java libraries.  However I would find HttpClient code much quicker and easier to write and maintain.  According to a comments below, the core elements of HttpClient have been performance optimised.  

If performance is a major concern your best bet is to write two clients, one using each method, then benchmark them both.  If you do this, please let us know the results.
