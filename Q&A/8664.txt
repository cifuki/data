Q:The Design Page of Android Developers Site has a category about colors. Color | Android Developers

There are good looking colors and they gratefully provide a download link for the color swatches. I don't know how to use them. The downloaded .zip contains the following files:


Android-ics.aco
Android-ics.ase
Android-ics.gpl
NOTICE.txt
values.txt


Does anybody know how to use these files? I guess I need a program to extract the color values?

Edit: OK it looks like it is an Adobe Color suite file. Does anybody know a free program to use these files?
