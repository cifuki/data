Q:in my app I use XML defined vertical dotted line.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rotate xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:fromDegrees="90"
    android:toDegrees="90">
<shape

    android:shape="line">
    <stroke

        android:width="1dp"
        android:color="@color/light_gray"
        android:dashWidth="2dp"
        android:dashGap="4dp"
        />
</shape>




When I am nitpicking my layout in Android Studio, the line is rendered properly dotted, as it should, but problem comes out when I run the app on real device. The line is just solid with no gaps..Do you know where could be the problem? I tried many different devices including those running latest 4.3 Android..It look everywhere the same:/

A:This is most likely related to hardware acceleration: Dashed lines are not supported in GL mode.

Its documented here:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=29944

Turn off your HW-acceleration in your AndroidManifest.xml like this:

android:hardwareAccelerated="false"


or:

myView.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null)
