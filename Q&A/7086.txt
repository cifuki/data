Q:I have seen a lot of mobile phone apps that just open a web page without the controls. Just the page.

I am looking for guidance and links to start something simple like this.

A:If I understand what you're asking for, on Windows Phone 7 you cannot get such an application approved in the Microsoft Marketplace. Section 2.10 of the Application Certification Requirements for Windows Phone says "Your application must have distinct, substantial and legitimate content and purpose. Your application must provide functionality other than launching a webpage."

A colleague of mine recently had a similar style application rejected by Apple for just that reason.

I think that on both platforms you may have been able to get these kinds of applications accepted in the past, but no longer.
