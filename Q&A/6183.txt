A:In the android studio(or more generally in the Intellij IDEA) you can specify inspection code that you want to analyze from Analyze->Inspect Code... and then define the scope of your code.
You can see the result for my code in the below picture:



In Declaration redundancy you can see that "someMethod" is declared unused. Also, in Probable bugs you can find variable i is never used.
