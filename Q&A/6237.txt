Q:I'm trying to start a Service from my Activity to look out for changes on a web page, it's a private app so I don't bother the battery life...

But I'd like to pass data from my Service to my Activity... I can't seem to find a way to call the Activity from my Service. How can I achieve this?

A:As Alex indicated, you can bind to the service and pass some sort of listener or callback to the service to use on events.

Or, you can use a broadcast Intent, perhaps using methods like setPackage() on the Intent to limit the scope of the broadcast.

Or, you can use createPendingResult() to create a PendingIntent that you pass as an Intent extra to the service -- the service can then use that PendingIntent to trigger onActivityResult() in your activity.

Or, you can use a ResultReceiver.

Or, you can use a Messenger.

(admittedly, I have not tried those latter two approaches, but I think they will work here)
