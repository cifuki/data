Q:So, I have an imageview that should display an arbitrary image, a profile picture downloaded from the internet. I want this the ImageView to scale its image to fit inside the height of the parent container, and a set max width of 60dip. However, if the image is tall ratio-wise, and doesn't need the full 60dip of width, the ImageView's width should decrease so the view's background fits snugly around the image.

I tried this, 

<ImageView android:id="@+id/menu_profile_picture"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:maxWidth="60dip"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:layout_marginLeft="2dip"
    android:padding="4dip"
    android:scaleType="centerInside"
    android:background="@drawable/menubar_button"
    android:layout_centerVertical="true"/>


but that made the ImageView super large for some reason, maybe it used the intrinsic width of the image and wrap_content to set it - anyway, it didn't respect my maxWidth attribute.. Does that only work inside some types of containers? It's in a LinearLayout...

Any suggestions?

A:Ah, 

android:adjustViewBounds="true"


is required for maxWidth to work. 

Works now!
