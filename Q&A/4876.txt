Q:I can finally ask a question to get my points up.  

In android studio, I want to be able to override the method, however I do not know the keyboard shortcut.  Does anyone know?

A:You can not remember all shortcuts :)
Android Studio(actually Intellij)
has a solution 

quick command search : ctrl+shift+A



if you have more memory here it is CTRL + O
