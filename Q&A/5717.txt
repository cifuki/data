Q:Is there any way in Android to draw a filled rectangle with say a black border. My problem is that the canvas.draw() takes one paint object, and to my knowledge the paint object can't have a different color for the fill and the stroke. Is there a way around this?

A:You draw a rectangle with the color of the border and the size of the rectangle plus the border, you change the color of the paint and draw again the rectangle with the normal size.
