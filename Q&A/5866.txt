Q:Immediately after publishing a new version of an application on Google Play, I get a burst of new crashes from an unknown device called "unknown Full Android on Emulator".

Here is a screenshot from Crashlytics after the application was uploaded to Google Play. This crash did not come from a real device.

Does anyone know what this emulator is?

Crashlytics console:



A similar pattern of crashes can be seen in this screen clip from the Splunk console:

A:Since soon after publishing a new version I see crashes almost only from this device, I'm guessing it's a Google Play new app publishing flow, where they monkey test your app.

I'm seeing crashes from Debug activities that can't be opened in the UI, but can be accessed via a direct intent, so I'm also guessing this monkey test goes over the manifest, launches random activities directly, and plays with them.
