Q:I am launching activities from the main activity in my app using the call startActivityForResult(intent, ACTIVITY_TYPE), and they are all working but one.  

This one, when called, launches the activity as desired, but in the log I can see that onActivityResult() is immediately being triggered.  The activity shows up but RESULT_CANCELED is immediately returned to onActivityResult().  

I then interact with the activity, press a button which calls finish(), and onActivityResult() is not called this time (because apparently a result has already been returned).

Does this make sense to anyone?  Has anyone seen this behavior before?

A:You can't use startActivityForResult() if your activity is being launched as a singleInstance or singleTask. standard or singleTop launch mode will fix the problem.
