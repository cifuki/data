Q:I am playing a sound file using this code inside a broadcast receiver activity:

notification.sound = Uri.parse("android.resource://emad.app/raw/seven_chimes");


I would like to detect when this file has finished playing.

I tried a loop like this but I think this is only good for the media player because it always = false even though I made sure the sound file was still playing:

/*
 * Stay here until the chime sound is finished.
 */
   while (manager.isMusicActive()){
   }


Can you show me what I should use instead of manager.isMusicActive()?

A:You can use the MediaPlayer class and add a Completion listener to be activated when the sound finishes playing 

MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(this,Uri.parse("android.resource://emad.app/raw/seven_chimes"));

mp.setOnCompletionListener(new OnCompletionListener() {

    @Override
    public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {
        performOnEnd();
    }

});

mp.start();
