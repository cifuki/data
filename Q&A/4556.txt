Q:I was working on a project, and then I got a prompt to update Android Studio. After I did that, I started getting this error when trying to run my app


It says  


  The project may need to be synced with Gradle files


How do I solve this?

A:Clicking the button 'Sync Project With Gradle Files' should do the trick:

Tools -> Android -> Sync Project with Gradle Files

If that fails, try running 'Rebuild project':

Build -> Rebuild Project

EDIT

Starting with Android Studio 3.1, you should go to:

File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files
