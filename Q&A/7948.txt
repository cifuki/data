Q:I was wondering, what is the common method being used to save Enum to SharedPrefereces? Currently, I'm using gson to convert enum to String, and then save it to SharedPrefereces.

    Gson gson = new Gson();
    // country is an enum.
    String json_country = gson.toJson(country);
    sharedPreferences.edit().putString(COUNTRY, json_country);


I was wondering, is this a good way? Is there any better way?

A:You can assotiate your enums with integers and store simple int, look this:

Cast Int to enum in Java (second answer) - also in same way you can do enumToInt
