Q:When I downloaded the Git project OsmAnd and went to compile it,
Eclipse returned these errors:

[Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: GC overhead limit exceeded
[OsmAnd]     Conversion to Dalvik format failed: 
             Unable to execute dex: GC overhead limit exceeded


Google and Stackoverflow said that I must change -Xms40m -Xmx384m in eclipse.ini. 
Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: Java heap space.
I cleaned project and restarted Eclipse, but it did not help.

I found this link: Tips for Android developer: \xe2\x80\x9cConversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: null\xe2\x80\x9d
But I do not know which .jar from my project to change the input in.
If anyone can help, I can send the project to them.

A:It can be fixed by changing the VM values in Eclipse.ini.  Set the values to 512 and 1024 as below:

openFile
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
512M
-showsplash
org.eclipse.platform
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.5
-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m
