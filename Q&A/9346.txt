Q:I noticed that the following permissions were automatically added when i use the following in my build.gradle file

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.5.0'


This did not occur with the earlier versions of the play-services.
does anyone have a solution to remove these unwanted permissions?

I am only using the ads function (INTERNET and ACCESSNETWORK_STATE).
I got no need for the LOCATION and USE_CREDENTIALS permissions.
How do you remove these unwanted permissions?

I noticed that the 'manifest-merger-xxx-debug-report.txt' file contains the following

A:When you use

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.5.0'


This implies you are using every feature of Google Play Services, including location services. If you only need a particular API, you should be using the selective APIs.

In the case of ads, you can use solely:

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:7.5.0'
