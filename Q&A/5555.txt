Q:I want to set my application to full screen view. I got the idea to set it in an individual activity using FullScreen and NoTitlebar, but i want to set it in my Manifest XML file for the whole application not for each activity... Is this possible?

Help me... Thanks.

A:To set your App or any individual activity display in Full Screen mode, insert the code 

<application 
    android:icon="@drawable/icon" 
    android:label="@string/app_name" 
    android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen">


in AndroidManifest.xml, under application or activity tab.
