Q:I have implemented a custom dialog for my application. I want to implement that when the user clicks outside the dialog, the dialog will be dismissed.
What do I have to do for this?

A:You can use dialog.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true); which will close the dialog if you touch outside of the dialog.

Something like,

  Dialog dialog = new Dialog(context)
  dialog.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true);


Or if your Dialog in non-model then,

1 - Set the flag-FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL for your dialog's window attribute

Window window = this.getWindow();
window.setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL,
WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL);


2 - Add another flag to windows properties,, FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH - this one is for dialog to receive touch event outside its visible region.

3 - Override onTouchEvent() of dialog and check for action type. if the action type is
'MotionEvent.ACTION_OUTSIDE' means, user is interacting outside the dialog region. So in this case, you can dimiss your dialog or decide what you wanted to perform.
view plainprint?

public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)  
{  

       if(event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_OUTSIDE){  
        System.out.println("TOuch outside the dialog ******************** ");  
               this.dismiss();  
       }  
       return false;  
}
