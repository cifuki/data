Q:I'd like to put a "Rate This App"-link in an Android App to open up the app-listing in the user's Google Play store app on their phone.


What code do I have to write to create the market:// or http://-link open in the Google Play store app on the phone?
Where do you put the code?
Does anyone have a sample implementation of this?
Do you have to specify the screen where the market:// or http:// link will be placed, and which is the best to use - market:// or http://?

A:I open the Play Store from my App with the following code:

    Uri uri = Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + context.getPackageName());
    Intent goToMarket = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);
    // To count with Play market backstack, After pressing back button, 
    // to taken back to our application, we need to add following flags to intent. 
    goToMarket.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY |
                    Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT |
                    Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK);
    try {
        startActivity(goToMarket);
    } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {
        startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW,
                Uri.parse("http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=" + context.getPackageName())));
    }


This will launch the Play Store with your App page already opened. The user can rate it there.
