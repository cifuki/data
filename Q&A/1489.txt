Q:I've just discovered Realm and wanted to explore it in more detail so I decided to create sample application and having a mess around with it. So far so good.

However, one thing I haven't been able to work out just yet is how to view my database in the Realm Browser. How can this be done?

A:Currently the Realm Browser doesn't support accessing databases directly on the device, so you need to copy the database from the emulator/phone to view it. That can be done by using ADB:

adb pull /data/data/<packagename>/files/ .

That command will pull all Realm files created using Realm.getInstance(new RealmConfiguration.Builder().build()) . The default database is called default.realm.

Note that this will only work on a emulator or if the device is rooted.
