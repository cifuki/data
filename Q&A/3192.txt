Q:I have just downloaded latest android studio from official android site and installed it. But I am getting this error instead of having Intel X 86 Emulator accelerator. What can cause this error

emulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration!
Please ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable.
CPU acceleration status: HAX kernel module is not installed!

A:If you are running a modern Intel processor make sure HAXM (Intel\xc2\xae Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) is installed:


In Android SDK Manager, ensure the option is ticked (and then installed) 
Run the HAXM installer via the path below:  

your_sdk_folder\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\\intelhaxm.exe
or
your_sdk_folder\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\\intelhaxm-android.exe



This video shows all the required steps which may help you to solve the problem.

For AMD CPUs (or older Intel CPUs without VT-x technology), you will not be able to install this and the best option is to emulate your apps using Genymotion.  See: Intel's HAXM equivalent for AMD on Windows OS
