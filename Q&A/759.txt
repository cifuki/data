Q:When upgrading my project to the latest version of Google Play Services (v4.0, released on Halloween 2013), you are now supposed to add a new tag into the AndroidManifest.xml file.

<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
    android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />


Unfortunately, when I try doing that, I then get this compile error:

android-apt-compiler: /blahblah/AndroidManifest.xml:409: error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'value' with value '@integer/google_play_services_version').


I can then navigate to the file at google-play-services_lib/res/values/version.xml and view the raw integer for that symbol:

<integer name="google_play_services_version">4030500</integer>


And then insert it back into my AndroidManifest.xml:

<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
    android:value="4030500" />


Doing this works absolutely fine and I can then compile and run the project and app just fine. But it's definitely an undesirable fix with obvious upgradability issues.

Any ideas?

A:For everyone using Eclipse, this is how you should do it.


  Eclipse -> import -> existing android code -> browse -> navigate to google-play-services_lib FOLDER (android-sdk/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject).


Then, on your project


  control click -> properties -> android -> libraries, add -> select the project you just imported -> ok
