Q:I am new to android application development and I am learning little bit. I am in a hard mission for sending push notification ( cloud messaging ) from my web server ( PHP ) to android application ( just a "helloworld" ). I did some "googling" and few of my doubts are


Google is sending notification using our "device id" right ?
Is there any code needed in our application other than adding some permission in out manifest for receiving notification ?
We have to register user's device id to "local database" in order to send notification am I ?


Please help me
Plus can any one please show me a code sample or documentation for sending a simple notification from PHP server ?

Thanks in advance

I don't have much knowledge about C2DM. Use GCM, it's very easy to implement and configure.
