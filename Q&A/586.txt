Q:referencing the play-services via gradle stopped working for me - boiled it down - even the sample I used as a reference in the first place stopped working:

I fear that just the version increased but that raises 2 questions: 
 #1) what is the new one?
 #2) why is the old version gone?

A:Check if you also installed the "Google Repository". If not, you also have to install the "Google Repository" in your SDK Manager.

Also be aware that there might be 2 SDK installations - one coming from AndroidStudio and one you might have installed. Better consolidate this to one installation - this is a common pitfall - that you have it installed in one installation but it fails when you build with the other installation.
