Q:I have used the following code to create a temporary file in my android app:

public File streamToFile (InputStream in) throws IOException {
    File tempFile = File.createTempFile("sample", ".tmp");
    tempFile.deleteOnExit();
    FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(tempFile);
    IOUtils.copy(in, out);
    return tempFile;
}


Now the problem is Cannot resolve symbol 'IOUtils'. I did a little bit of googling and discovered that for  using IOUtils I need to download and include a jar file. I downloaded the jar file from here(commons-io-2.4-bin.zip). I added the jar named commons-io-2.4.jar from the zip to my bundle and when I tried to import it using:

import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;


It is showing error Cannot resolve symbol 'io'. So I tried to import it like:

import org.apache.commons.*


But still I am getting the error Cannot resolve symbol 'IOUtils'.

Question 1 : Why am I getting this error? How to resolve it?

Question 2 : Is there any way to create a temp file from an InputStream without using an external library? Or is this the most efficient way to do that? I am using android studio.

A:For Android Studio:


File -> Project Structure... -> Dependencies
Click '+' in the upper right corner and select "Library dependency"
In the search field type: "org.apache.commons.io" and click Search
Select "org.apache.directory.studio:org.apache.commons.io:


Happy coding :)
