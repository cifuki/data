Q:So I'm getting really frustrated with android and the fact half the stuff doesn't work when you roll back the API Level past 11. Why isn't it easy and well done like iOS?!

The Problem
I am using ObjectAnimators to animate the transitioning between Fragments. They work fine in anything with API Level 11 and above. As soon as I change the build target to less than 11 I get problems with it saying it can't found the resource identifiers for attributes such as propertyName and valueType in the xml file.

The Question 
What should I use instead to animate my Fragment transitions that will work on API Levels > 7.

Thanks in advance.

A:I suggest using http://nineoldandroids.com/ , its from the same maker of the ActionBarSherlock project, it introduces a support ObjectAnimator that works from API 1 onwards.
