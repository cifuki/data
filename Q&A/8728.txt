Q:This question already has an answer here:
    
        
            What is the point of the diamond operator (<>) in Java 7?

I'm using Android Studio and I write this :

List<Button> buttons = new ArrayList<Button>();


I have this message :


  Explicit type argument Button should be replaced by <>


I'm curious, why would it be better to use diamond instead ?

List<Button> buttons = new ArrayList<>();


EDIT :
I don't agree with the duplicate at all ! I saw that answer before and it compares explicit argument to no argument at all, whereas I compare explicit argument to implicit argument !

A:It is less verbose, consider the following

Map<String,List<String>> map = new HashMap<String,List<String>>();


vs 

Map<String,List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();


I think you would go for the second option
