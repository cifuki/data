Q:I want to add an image file into json object . Is it possible to add image file into json object?

I tried below code but its not working ? Because i want to send that json object to the server then server will read my image file and store into that database.

JSONObject test = new JSONObject();
test.put("photo",new File(// Here i set image uri));


So when I print this json object it only show me the image path where the image stored. I want file for sending it to server.

A:You will need to read the bytes from that File into a byte[] and put that object into your JSONObject.

You should also have a look at the following posts :


ByteArray in JSON
Binary Data in JSON String. Something better than Base64
BSON library for java


Hope this helps.
