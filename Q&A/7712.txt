Q:When using a SwipeRefreshLayout in combination with a overlay mode ActionBar, the loading animation will be displayed behind the actionbar, making it almost invisible.

Is there anything I can do to show it on top of the actionbar?

A:In the Material Design version of the appcompat-v7 library (v21.0.0), SwipeRefreshLayout gets a method to set the Progress View offset.

https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.html#setProgressViewOffset(boolean,%20int,%20int)


  public void setProgressViewOffset (boolean scale, int start, int end)
  
  The refresh indicator starting and resting position is always positioned near the top of the refreshing content. This position is a consistent location, but can be adjusted in either direction based on whether or not there is a toolbar or actionbar present.
  
  Parameters
  
  scale   Set to true if there is no view at a higher z-order than where the progress spinner is set to appear.
  
  start   The offset in pixels from the top of this view at which the progress spinner should appear.
  
  end     The offset in pixels from the top of this view at which the progress spinner should come to rest after a successful swipe gesture.
