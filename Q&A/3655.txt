Q:I recently downloaded Android Studio to develop Android applications (I'm coming from Eclipse), and I am having issues using external libraries and/or external JAR files alongside my own project. NOTE: the following tests were conducted on a new application project created from scratch in Android Studio.

Example 1: JAR Import.


Download a fresh copy of the Admobs SDK from Google.
Copy the library jar GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1.jar to the project's /libs/ folder.
In the project explorer, right click on the newly added library.jar and click on 'Add as Library'.


Technically at this point everything works, imports work just fine, the layout editor shows a preview of the AdView widget and all that. The only problem is that it doesn't compile successfully.

Log from console:

Gradle: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':APITests:compilePaidDebug'.
> Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip'.


I tried running gradlew compileDebug --stacktrace, and the problem seems to be that the despite being able to import the classes successfully in both the code & design editor, at compile time, it cannot resolve the imports. Here's the relevant part of the log: (full stacktrace here)

java:6: error: package com.google.ads does not exist
import com.google.ads.AdRequest;    
java:7: error: package com.google.ads does not exist
import com.google.ads.AdView;
java:11: error: cannot find symbol
AdView mAdView;
symbol:   class AdView
location: class MainActivity
java:22: error: cannot find symbol
mAdView = (AdView)this.findViewById(R.id.adView);
symbol:   class AdView
location: class MainActivity
java:23: error: cannot find symbol
mAdView.loadAd(new AdRequest());
symbol:   class AdRequest
location: class MainActivity
5 errors
:Test:compileDebug FAILED


But again, the imports work well in the editor, and the dependency is there:



It's also worth noting that without attempting to add a library/JAR, the projects compiles just fine.

I then tried editing the build.gradle file to include the new lib like this:

dependencies {
compile files('libs/android-support-v4.jar', 'libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1.jar')
}


This time, it did compile successfully, but the app now forces closes, as apparently, it cannot find a specific class from the lib in the application package.

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.google.ads.AdView" on path: /data/app/com.foo.test-1.apk


Any ideas?

A:So, 

Steps to follow in order to import a JAR sucesfully to your project using Android Studio 0.1.1: 


Download the library.jar file and copy it to your /libs/ folder inside your application project. 
Open the build.gradle file and edit your dependencies to include the new .jar file: 


compile files('libs/android-support-v4.jar', 'libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1.jar')


File -> Close Project
Open a command prompt on your project's root location, i.e 'C:\\Users\\Username\\AndroidStudioProjects\\MyApplicationProject\\'
On the command prompt, type gradlew clean, wait till it's done. 
Reopen your application project in Android Studio. 
Test run your application and it should work succesfully.
