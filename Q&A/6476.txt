Q:I'm trying to install Android Studio on a 64-bit Fedora 21 system.

I got the JRE and JDK pre-requisites installed, unpacked the Android Studio installation, and from its "bin" directory issued "sh studio.sh" to complete the installation.

The Setup Wizard failed with message "Unable to run mksdcard SDK tool" and suggested that 32-bit libraries might be needed.

A:(This answer is for an Ubuntu distribution)

If you are running the 64-bit Ubuntu, the following fix should solve your problem:

sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 lib32stdc++6




UPDATE:

For Ubuntu 15.10 and 16 (Provided by tony gil and briankip) : 

sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32stdc++6


This also works on GNU/Linux Debian 9 (Stretch) x86_64.
