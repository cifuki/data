Q:My app is using JSoup to download the HTML of a message board page (let's say in this case it is a page containing the posts of a given thread). I'd like to take this HTML, strip out unwanted items, and apply custom CSS to style it to be 'mobile' in a WebView.

Should I inject the styles into the HTML as I process it (since I will be processing it anyway) or is there a good way to add a CSS file to my app's assets and simply refer to it. I figure the latter would be ideal, but unsure how to go about it.

I see hints in WebView's loadDataWithBaseURL that you can refer to local assets, but not sure how to utilize it.

A:You could use WebView.loadDataWithBaseURL

htmlData = "<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" type=\\"text/css\\" href=\\"style.css\\" />" + htmlData;
// lets assume we have /assets/style.css file
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL("file:///android_asset/", htmlData, "text/html", "UTF-8", null);


And only after that WebView will be able to find and use css-files from the assets directory.

ps And, yes, if you load your html-file form the assets folder, you don't need to specify a base url.
