Q:When I add android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar or another android.support.v7.widget.* there are rendering problems. 

But Support Library is up to date. And I complied in dependecies properly. I can import them in MainActivity.java

What is the problem?

A:I don't know if this will help or not, but I was creating a test project (direct from the wizard, no custom code) and getting this error. Trying to modify the project structure and find the missing class didn't help. 

The build failed with the following error:

***rendering problems

The following classes could not be found
android.support.v7.internal.widget.ActionBarOverlayLayout*** 

Obviously it's not the final solution, but changing the Theme in design view from the base "project theme" to anything else allows it to build.
