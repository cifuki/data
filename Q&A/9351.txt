Q:I'm using ThreeTen-Backport library for my Android project (because java.time is not yet implemented in android development).  

When I write LocalDate today=LocalDate.now(); or LocalTime time=LocalTime.now(); I get the following exception:

Caused by: org.threeten.bp.zone.ZoneRulesException: 
  No time-zone data files registered   
      at org.threeten.bp.zone.ZoneRulesProvider.getProvider(ZoneRulesProvider.java:176)
      at org.threeten.bp.zone.ZoneRulesProvider.getRules(ZoneRulesProvider.java:133)

      at org.threeten.bp.Clock.systemDefaultZone(Clock.java:137)
      at org.threeten.bp.LocalDate.now(LocalDate.java:165)


The same line of code works well in another java project I have, which uses the native java.time library.  

I searched for a possible solution but couldn't find anything useful: one solution suggested I need to use another jar that includes the time-zone rules and other suggested that there might be two or more ThreeTenBP-libraries inside the classpath.
Those cases don't match my case.

Inside the build.gradle file, at the dependencies section, I've tried few configurations:  


At first, I used - compile 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.0.3'
Then, I tried -
compile 'org.threeten:threetenbp:1.0.3'
After that, I tried -
compile 'org.threeten:threetenbp:1.3.1'
Currently, I use compile 'org.threeten:threetenbp:1.3.2'


I don't know what is wrong with that line of code and how to fix it.
The LocalDate.now() and LocalTime.now() methods should work without specifying a time zone.

A:For Android project you should use 

implementation 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.0.3'


Make sure you call AndroidThreeTen.init(this); before using the classes from the library. This will read the time zones data (included in the library). You can initialize the library in your Application class in the onCreate method just like it is recommended in the README.
