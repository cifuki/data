Q:I'm wondering how vector drawing in Android with the Shape class may resemble another vector drawing standard.

Since Shape is a Drawable, and Drawables are usually defined as XML, it sounds a lot like the vector drawing commands in SVG.

My question is this: Has anybody created an XSLT transformation, or other mechanism, for converting an SVG drawing description into Android Shapes?
