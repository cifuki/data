I set visibility to invisible like this on Android:

myImageView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);


And then to make it visible:

myImageView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);


Now I don't know if myImageView is visible or not, how can I check it like this:

if (myImageView IS VISIBLE) {
    Do something
} else {
    Do something else
}


How can I do that? What do I have to write within the brackets?

A:Although View.getVisibility() does get the visibility, its not a simple true/false. A view can have its visibility set to one of three things.

View.VISIBLE
The view is visible.

View.INVISIBLE
The view is invisible, but any spacing it would normally take up will still be used. Its "invisible"

View.GONE
The view is gone, you can't see it and it doesn't take up the "spot".

So to answer your question, you're looking for:

if (myImageView.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {
    // Its visible
} else {
    // Either gone or invisible
}
