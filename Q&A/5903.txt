Q:When I start up my Android ADT most if not all of my projects have a red exclamation next to them. And when I try to build and run them I get an error: 

"google-play-services_lib] Unable to resolve target 'android-9'"

I am not sure what this means as I am up to date with my updates with my Android SDK manager.

I have tried restarting eclipse. I have tried downloading another Android SDK and running from there but still the same error.

Please help guide me into the right direction.

A:Actually downloading the latest ADT bundle for Eclipse gives the same error when trying to import the google_play_services_lib (17). http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download

Open the SDK Manager, click obsolete (so API 9 shows up), and grab API 9.  This is really something that seems like a simple oversight and should be fixed.  Hope this helps others.
