Q:I have an activity which has a fragment.

XML:

 <fragment android:name="com.example.androidcalculator.ResultFragment"
            android:id="@+id/result_fragment"
            android:layout_weight="1"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content" />


And I want to call a method from ResultFragment from a method in the Activity, but getSupportFragmentManager "doesn't exist":

FragmentManager fragMan = getSupportFragmentManager();


How can I resolve this?

A:Your activity doesn't extend FragmentActivity from the support library, therefore the method is not present in the superclass

If you are targeting api 11 or above, you could use Activity.getFragmentManager instead.
