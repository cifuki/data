Q:Is there a base-64 decoder and encoder for a String in Android?

A:See android.util.Base64

It seems that this was added in API version 8 or android 2.2 so it will not be available on the older platforms.

But the source of it is at android/util/Base64.java so if needed one could just copy it unchanged for older versions.
