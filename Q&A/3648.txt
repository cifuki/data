Q:I made a stupid mistake by upgrading my SDK version to r15 as the android repository was not loading. How do I revert back to my older version r10? 
Or is sticking with the newer version better? I'll have to upgrade my ADT Plugin as well then. 
Thanks a lot.

A:Anyway, for those who want to downgrade Android SDK Tools to a previous version, it can be possible following these steps: 


Find your Android SDK folder
Locate the "tools" subfolder and rename it to "tools1" (just to keep a backup copy of the original tools folder)
Likewise, rename platform-tools to platform-tools1
Download from google repository the SDK Tool version you want to downgrade to (for instance: http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r22.6.2-macosx.zip) and unpack it.
The ZIP file you downloaded contains a tools folder that has to be moved to your Android SDK folder.
Likewise, download the platform tools (for instance: http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r19.0.1-macosx.zip), and extract it in your SDK folder.


That's it.
