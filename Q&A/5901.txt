Q:I was working on an android tutorial and it wanted me to import the library from another project .The import worked and the project works correctly. But I noticed that doing that messed up several of my other projects (the ones that use Android 2.1) by apparently messing with the build path. Now instead of seeing "Google APIs [Android 2.1]" under the gen folder I see "Unable to get system library for project". 

I verified the following:

I right-clicked the project and went to Properties I see that the correct Project Build Target is checked(Google APIs [Android 2.1]), but "Unable to get system library for project" is still shown above the assets folder and below gen and Android Dependencies. Cleaning all projects doesn't help. 

How can I fix this problem?
is there a way to fix this issue globally or do I have to do it one by one?

A:I had the same problem.  Try  


Right click on your project  
Go to properties  
Click the Android section  
Select a different target api (assuming one is already selected, as mine was - otherwise, select the one you want and jump to step 9)  
Click OK  
Do steps 1-3 again  
Select your original target api  
Click OK  
Clean and build your project  


Worked for me, anyway.

Derived the solution from: 
"Unable to get system library for project" after I upgraded to Android SDK 2.3 and ADT 8.0
