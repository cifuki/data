Q:I know the absolute path of an image (say for eg, /sdcard/cats.jpg).  Is there any way to the content uri for this file ? 

Actually in my code I download an image and save it at a particular location. In order to set the image in an ImageView currently I open the file using the path, get the bytes and create a bitmap and then set the bitmap in the ImageView. This is a very slow process, instead if I could get the content uri then I could very easily use the method    ImageView.setImageUri(uri)

A:Try with:

ImageView.setImageURI(Uri.fromFile(new File("/sdcard/cats.jpg")));


Or with:

ImageView.setImageURI(Uri.parse(new File("/sdcard/cats.jpg").toString()));
