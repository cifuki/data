Q:I would like to read the content of a file located in the Assets as a String. For example, a text document located in src/main/assets/

Original Question
I found that this question is mostly used as a 'FAQ' for reading an assets file, therefore I summarized the question above. Below is my original naive question

I'm trying to read a assets file as string, I tried like 20 answers here but they don't work for me.

I have a file in my assets folder: data.opml, and I have to put the content in a string. I send it like:

 OPML.importFromFile(string, MainTabActivity.this);


And receive it like:

 importFromFile(String filename, Context context); 


Something that did work (but it's not a assets file):

 OPML.importFromFile(new StringBuilder(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString()).append(File.separator).append(fileNames[which]).toString(),MainTabActivity.this);


I've tried:

 AssetFileDescriptor descriptor = getAssets().openFd("data.opml");
 FileReader reader = new FileReader(descriptor.getFileDescriptor());
 And also:
 InputStream input = getAssets().open("data.opml");
 Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(input, "UTF-8");


Maby I'm doing something wrong, but it just won't work because it the project gives errors (respectively: OPML is not capable for the arguments filereader and reader) , If somebody knows how to do this, it would be very appreciated!

A:getAssets().open() will return an InputStream. Read from that using standard Java I/O:
Java:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
InputStream is = getAssets().open("book/contents.json");
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ));
String str;
while ((str = br.readLine()) != null) {
    sb.append(str);
}
br.close();


Kotlin:

val str = assets.open("book/contents.json").bufferedReader().use { it.readText() }
