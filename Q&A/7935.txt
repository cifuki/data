Q:When trying to upgrade Android SDK Tools to revision 16, I am getting the following error:


  Failed to rename directory C:\\android-sdk-windows\\tools to
  C:\\android-sdk-windows\\temp\\ToolPackage.old01.
  
  Done. Nothing was installed.




Nothing I try to do, including providing FULL permissions (in addition to the special permissions it already had) to Administrator, helps.

Also, I don't know of anything that is accessing those directories.

How do I fix this problem?

A:This is how I fixed it in Windows 7:

Make a copy of the \\tools folder, name it something like \\copy.  So you should have c:\\android-sdk-windows\\copy.  Now run android.bat from the \\copy folder with Admin privileges.  This should prevent the issue with items currently being open in the \\tools folder.
