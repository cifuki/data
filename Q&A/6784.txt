Q:I've been looking through the documentation for ProgressBar class and found these attributes:


android:progressBarStyle
android:progressBarStyleHorizontal
android:progressBarStyleLarge
android:progressBarStyleSmall


These four parameters are supposed to be a reference to some style as I take it. So the question is, what are these for? Style for the progress bar is set via android:style attribute and a reference to the global style attributes.

Documentation doesn't say anything helpful, searched the Web, found nothing.

A:The four attributes that you mention can be applied to a ProgressBar's style like so:

style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleHorizontal"


The style constant android:progressBarStyleHorizontal is your typical incremental progress bar:



While the other three are varying sizes of the same circular progress bar:

style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleSmall"




style="?android:attr/progressBarStyle"




style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleLarge"




Update:

According to adamp's comments:


  These are attributes of the theme that
  point at themed styles you can use for
  progress indicators...They are not attributes for ProgressBar itself.
