Q:As per my research, there is a significant difference in the concept of backstack and how they exist:

Activity


When an activity is placed to the backstack of activities the user
can navigate back to the previous activity by just pressing the back
button.
Activity can exist independently.


Fragment


When an fragment is placed to the activity we have to request the
instance to be saved by calling addToBackstack() during the fragment
transaction.
Fragment has to live inside the activity


Are there any additional differences?

A:Those are two completely different things:

An Activity is an application component that provides a screen, with which users can interact in order to do something. More details:

Whereas a Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity.
