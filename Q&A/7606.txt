Q:My screen is dead and I want to unlock my phone so I can access it through Kies to backup my pictures.

I locked the phone through Android Device Manager setting an easy password (was hoping for an Unlock option once I locked it) and tried various methods to unlock it for example:

adb shell input text 1234


Since I don't know what the lock screen look like I'm not sure of the correct inputs to unlock it.

I know the phone is on and that it responds to adb. I am also able to run apps on it through Eclipse.
It's a Samsung Galaxy S5 with Android 5.0.

A:If you have to click OK after entering your passcode, this command will unlock your phone:

adb shell input text XXXX && adb shell input keyevent 66


Where


XXXX is your passcode.
66 is keycode of button OK.
adb shell input text XXXX will enter your passcode.
adb shell input keyevent 66 will simulate click the OK button
