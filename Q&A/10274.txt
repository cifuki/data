A:You should update your Virtual Device that's all, if you are not looking to see new feature then you can click on "Continue" button.

When you update it then you will have a fresh Virtual Device then there you  need to install the other third party apps which if you installed in your current virtual device like Google Apps (Play Store, Google+ etc)

  We regularly add new features to Genymotion. These new features cannot work on virtual devices created with a previous version of Genymotion. This is why you see an annoying popup when you try to run them from a new Genymotion version. But rejoice! Today is the last day you will have to do it. In this release, we have introduced a wizard that automatically migrates old devices to new ones. So please, for the last time, delete your current virtual devices and create new ones using our new 2.2 Genymotion version. Next time, you will be able to automatically convert them.




If you are using the free version, you can't use update on a virtual device (it's only for paid version). So what you need to do is remove that device from your list and re-download or add that same virtual device from the list again. This should solve to stop that popup.
