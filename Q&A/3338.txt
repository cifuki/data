Q:I have a linear layout that is contained inside a relative layout. 
It is set in the XML file to be to the right of another linear layout (this works fine).
In some cases I want to change the relative position of the layout during the onCreate of the activity so I need to modify the "to the right of" param to relate to another layout.
I tryed this:

    RelativeLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams;

    layoutParams = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) linearLayoutToMove
            .getLayoutParams();
    layoutParams.addRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF,
            R.id.new_ref_LinearLayout);


But it does not work :o(

Any clues ?

A:You can't remove a rule because all rules are always stored in a fixed-size java array. But you can set a rule to 0. For example

layoutParams.addRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF, 0);
layoutParams.addRule(RelativeLayout.BELOW, R.id.new_ref_LinearLayout);


EDIT (thanks to Roger Rapid):

As of API level 17, the class RelativeLayout.LayoutParams has the following method:

public void removeRule(int verb) 


So you can remove a rule using the following line of code:

layoutParams.removeRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF);


And you will get exactly the same result as when 'adding' a zero-rule as:

layoutParams.addRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF, 0);
