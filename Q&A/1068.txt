Q:I am trying to connect to an IIS6 box running a godaddy 256bit SSL cert, and I am getting the error :

java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.


Been trying to determine what could be causing that, but drawing blanks right now.

Here is how I am connecting :

HttpsURLConnection conn;              
conn = (HttpsURLConnection) (new URL(mURL)).openConnection();
conn.setConnectTimeout(20000);
conn.setDoInput(true);
conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.connect();
String tempString = toString(conn.getInputStream());

A:The solution of @Chrispix is dangerous! Trusting all certificates allows anybody to do a man in the middle attack! Just send ANY certificate to the client and it will accept it!

Add your certificate(s) to a custom trust manager like described in this post: Trusting all certificates using HttpClient over HTTPS

Although it is a bit more complex to establish a secure connection with a custom certificate, it will bring you the wanted ssl encryption security without the danger of man in the middle attack!
