Q:Unbelievably enough, I couldn't find an answer when Googling for this very basic question!

I noticed that since I upgraded from Eclipse Helios to Eclipse Juno and updated the Android SDK, Eclipse places a file called ic_launcher-web.png in the project root whenever I create a new Android project. The file is the same as the application icon selected in the project creation dialog, but what does it do? As mentioned, it's in the project root, not in any of the /res/ folders. So is it included in the finished .apk file, and what is it's purpose?

A:It's for the Play Store, which accepts 512x512 high-resolution icons:


  
  High Resolution Application Icon (Required):

It is not used in your actual app or the launcher, so it is not packaged in the APK.
