Q:Im trying to pass data between two fragmens in my program. Its just a simple string that is stored in the List. The List is made public in fragments A, and when the user clicks on a list item, I need it to show up in fragment B. The content provider only seems to support ID's, so that will not work. Any suggestions?

A:I think communication between fragments should be done via activity. And communication between fragment and activity can be done this way:
