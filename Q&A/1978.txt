Q:I want to exclude some file paths from ProGuard. Example com.myapp.customcomponents

How can I do this?  I hate to be placing -keep flags for every single custom component file I have in this directory.

I have tried the following but it doesn't work:

-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.*

A:You don't specify in what way it doesn't work. Your configuration keeps the names of all public classes in the specified package:

-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.*


The following configuration keeps the names of all public classes in the specified package and its subpackages:

-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.**


The following configuration keeps the names of all public/protected classes/fields/methods in the specified package and its subpackages:

-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.** {
  public protected *;
}
