Q:So, i have cloned the tutorial app repo from ionic. I ran

ionic start conference sidemenu


and then i added a simple $http.get('myserver')(I tried with ngResources too). 

It worked perfect on chrome, I got all the data back but on angular i only got null data and 404 status on any request I tried to do.

Note: I tried with my hosted server and with a local one. Both fail on Android. 
Server is a node.js REST API.

Nothing is printed on the console, so the request does not even get to the server.

Has anyone experienced that or could tell me how can I debug Android apps built with Ionic?

EDIT 1: I don`t know why do you need it but here it is

$http.get('http://server.com/route').success(function (data) {
            //handle success
        }).error(function (data, status) {
            // handle error
        });

A:The thing is that there were some major changes in Cordova 4.0.0:


  Major Changes
  [...]
  -  Whitelist functionality is now provided via plugin (CB-7747) The
     whitelist has been enhanced to be more secure and configurable
     Setting of Content-Security-Policy is now supported by the framework
     (see details in plugin readme) You will need to add the new
     cordova-plugin-whitelist plugin Legacy whitelist behaviour is still
     available via plugin (although not recommended).


So I installed the Cordova Whitelist plugin. And added 

<allow-navigation href="http://*/*" />


in my config.xml file.
