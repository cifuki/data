Q:I want to write an Android app and I've started this morning by loading JDK, eclipse, SDK etc, all from the adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20130219 from http://developer.android.com.

The issue for me right now: 


  [2013-02-27 13:36:26 - Test2] Android Launch!
      [2013-02-27 13:36:26 - Test2] adb is running normally.
      [2013-02-27 13:36:26 - Test2] Performing com.example.test2.MainActivity activity launch
      [2013-02-27 13:37:27 - Test2] Launching a new emulator with Virtual Device 'droidX2'
      [2013-02-27 13:37:27 - Emulator] PANIC: Could not open: droidX2  


I've been sifting though posts on the web all morning about AVD and I haven't seen one that didn't involve the path being messed up and the .ini not found. I don't think I've got a path issue. AVD is looking for files on D:\\USERS\\XXX\\.android\\avd and that's where the files are. So don't understand why the emulator can't open. 

I've done the most basic things like remove and re-install everything, read the notes at orace etc. Basically I'm stuck. Any suggestions here?

adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20130219 was what I loaded on Windows 7 (32bit).

I'd settle for testing on the mobile that's connected to the PC but I can't get that to work either!

Any direction appreciated.

A:This has been asked a few times already, try these:


  Create a environment variable called: ANDROID_SDK_HOME and set it to
  C:\\Users\\Administrator Open Eclipse > Window > Preferences and click
  in Run/Debug and String Substitution Add a new variable called:
  user.home and set it to C:\\Users\\Administrator Create an AVD and run
  it.


Original answer by Colin

an android project member says here:


  As a work-around, you can define the environment variable
  ANDROID_SDK_HOME to point to the directory containing your .android
  directory. The emulator and SDK Manager will pick it up properly.
