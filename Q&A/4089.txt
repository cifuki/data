Q:A call to getLocationOnScreen() or getLocationInWindow() both give me a top/Y coordinate that is about ~30px (status/notifications bar's height) too far down.  The left/X coordinate is dead on.  

As I hinted above, I believe the difference is because of the status/notification bar...  I could be wrong.  I think I can solve this if I can determine the size of the notification bar but, I'm having trouble doing just that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A:I ended up solving this issue by determining the height of the status/notification bar like so:

View globalView = ...; // the main view of my activity/application

DisplayMetrics dm = new DisplayMetrics();
this.getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(dm);
int topOffset = dm.heightPixels - globalView.getMeasuredHeight();

View tempView = ...; // the view you'd like to locate
int[] loc = new int[2]; 
tempView.getLocationOnScreen(loc);

final int y = loc[1] - topOffset;
