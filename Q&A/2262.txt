Q:How can custom headers be set for a Volley request? At the moment, there is way to set body content for a POST request. I've a simple GET request, but I need to pass the custom headers alongwith. I don't see how JsonRequest class supports it. Is it possible at all?

A:It looks like you override public Map<String, String> getHeaders(), defined in Request, to return your desired HTTP headers.
