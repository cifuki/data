Q:I am modifying my app to be able to catch if a user tries to publish without having the facebook app installed (required for SSO).  Here is the code I am using:

try{
    ApplicationInfo info = getPackageManager().
            getApplicationInfo("com.facebook.android", 0 );
    return true;
} catch( PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e ){
    return false;
}


The problem is, it is always catching an error.  According to the question here, I need to request the appropriate permission but I don't know what permissions I need to request.

Is my problem a permission one or something else?

A:com.facebook.android is the package name for the Facebook SDK. The Facebook app's package is com.facebook.katana.
