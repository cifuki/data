Q:This question is identical to How to shut down Android emulator via command line.

However, after attempting the suggested solution from the first answer adb emu kill has not proven successful for me.

I am automating unit tests for an android application. My bash script runs on a headless machine. It creates an android device using android create avd and executes emulator with the -no-window attribute. It then compiles the test project, connects to the emulator using adb, installs the project and executes my tests. This all works fine.

Now I need to terminate the emulator process, and just like the referenced post, I am only able to do this using kill -9. 

The Google tutorial Managing AVDs from the Command Line only mentions how to stop emulators within a GUI environment. 

Any help is appreciated.

A:Maybe try using adb kill-server it should work for you?

or

adb -s emulator-5554 emu kill, where emulator-5554 is the emulator name.

For Ubuntu users I found a good command to stop all running emulators (Thanks to @uwe)

adb devices | grep emulator | cut -f1 | while read line; do adb -s $line emu kill; done
