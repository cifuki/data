Q:I am new to Android development and bought a cheap Huawei Sonic (U8650 apparently) so I could test my first attempts at making an app on an actual device.

However, whenever I try to use 'adb logcat' or 'adb shell' then 'logcat' on the device I get:

Unable to open log device '/dev/log/main': No such file or directory


I have already enabled Usb debugging in Settings -> Developer.

I just don't know enough about Android to know if this is something I can even fix.

I have found two other questions with similar problems:

/dev/log/main not found

??-?? ??:??:??.???: INFO/<unknown>(<unknown>): Unable to open log device '/dev/log/main': No such file or directory

...but they both turned out to be using some kind of non standard kernel that had logging disabled. Mine is a stock phone out of the box.

It's a very cheap but snappy Android 2.3 phone, so hopefully it wasn't a total waste of money.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A:Dial this: *#*#2846579#*#* 
Service menu will appear. 
Go to "ProjectMenu" -> "Background Setting" -> "Log Setting" 

Open "Log switch" and set it to ON.  
Open "Log level setting" and set the log level you wish.

Reboot the phone.
