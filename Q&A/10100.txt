Q:I have an ionic/cordova project using:

cordova-android@6.2.0
cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview@2.3.0
cordova cli 6.4.0
ionic 1.3.3


When I try to add the Android platform, I get the following output

================

$ ionic platform add android@6.2.0

Adding android project...


Creating Cordova project for the Android platform:

    Path: platforms/android
    Package: com.ionicframework.name
    Name: name
    Activity: MainActivity
    Android target: android-25

Subproject Path: CordovaLib

Android project created with cordova-android@6.2.0



  Error: cordovaProject.projectConfig.getFileResources is not a function

A:It seems this issue is related to a bug in cordova-android@6.2.0, as confirmed here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12633

I have now updated my system to cordova-cli - cordova@6.5.0 and cordova-android@6.2.1, and it seemed to work.

Update to version 6 of cordova cli with:

npm install -g cordova@6


And then add the correct version of cordova-android

cordova platform add android@6


Not directly related to this issue, but once I got it working, my system did complain about the gradle path not being set when I tried building my app, and so I followed the steps here: https://gradle.org/install#with-homebrew, and now all builds successfully.
