Is there any possible way to debug or run android apps from eclipse to my Sony Tablet S over wifi rather than USB without rooting the device? 

There are ways to do it, if the device is rooted. However, I am seeking the solution in a device that is not rooted.

A:Disconnect device from usb then tell it to listen on 4455

adb tcpip 4455


restarting in TCP mode port: 4455


connect to the device using a specified ip:port. my device is using wifi

adb connect 192.168.1.103:4455


connected to 192.168.1.103:4455


now do normal adb commands over tcp like

adb shell
when your done, you can put it back in USB mode
adb usb
restarting in USB mode
