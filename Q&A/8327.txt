Q:I know similar question to this one has been asked a numerous times, and surfing through SO I partially found an answer, but not complete, and android docs don't really help. Obviously I know how they work and have used shared preferences many times before, but I am wondering at what point ( how many ) is too much, I've read people had ~ 100KBS stored without any problem. Long story short -- 
Did someone actually had problems with too many data stored in shared preferences and what was problem, does data get deleted or?

** this is only a question out of curiosity, I already have my large values stored in SQL DB, just wondered what would be and if there would be any problems if someone for some reason stored everything in shared preferences

A:Since SharedPreferences are stored in an XML file, and therefore lacks the strong transaction support of SQLite, I would not recommend storing "100KBS" in SharedPreferences.

That being said, the lowest size limit that I am aware of will be your amount of free heap space, as SharedPreferences reads that entire XML file's contents into memory.
