Q:I have link of my other apps in my latest app, and  I open them in that way.

Uri uri = Uri.parse("url");
Intent intent = new Intent (Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri); 
startActivity(intent);


this codes opens the browser version of google play store.

When trying to open from my phone, the phone prompts if I want to use a browser or google play and if I choose the second one it opens the mobile version of google play store.

Can you tell me how can this happen at once? I mean not ask me but directly open the mobile version of google play, the one that I see while open it directly from phone.

A:You'll want to use the specified market protocol:

final String appPackageName = "com.example"; // Can also use getPackageName(), as below
startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + appPackageName)));


Keep in mind, this will crash on any device that does not have the Market installed (the emulator, for example). Hence, I would suggest something like:

final String appPackageName = getPackageName(); // getPackageName() from Context or Activity object
try {
    startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + appPackageName)));
} catch (android.content.ActivityNotFoundException anfe) {
    startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=" + appPackageName)));
}


While using getPackageName() from Context or subclass thereof for consistency (thanks @cprcrack!). You can find more on Market Intents here: link.
