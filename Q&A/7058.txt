Q:I created some project using the light theme and now I want to change it to dark and I can't figure out how to do that. BTW, I'm not asking on how to do it in code, just how to change the project's default theme.

A:In the AndroidManifest.xml, under the application tag, you can set the theme of your choice. To customize the theme, press Ctrl + Click on android:theme = "@style/AppTheme" in the Android manifest file. It will open styles.xml file where you can change the parent attribute of the style tag.

At parent= in styles.xml you can browse all available styles by using auto-complete inside the "". E.g. try parent="Theme." with your cursor right after the . and then pressing Ctrl + Space.

You can also preview themes in the preview window in Android Studio.
