Q:I have a list view connected to a database, showing a all the entries. I want a menu to show up if the user long clicks a item in the listview(database entry), showing options to edit or delete the entry. how can i do this. 

Till now, I have tried using a onItemLongClick listener and a toast in it showing the id of the view long clicked.

@Override
public boolean onItemLongClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view,
        int position, long id) {

    String res = Long.toString(id);
     Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, res, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
     toast.show();

    return true;
}

A:Instead of using onItemLongClick you can use 

public void onCreateContextMenu(final ContextMenu menu, 
                    final View v, final ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {
 ...
}


where you setup the options for edit and delete or whatever you need to.

The actions for the item selected from the context menu can be processed in

public boolean onContextItemSelected(final MenuItem item)
