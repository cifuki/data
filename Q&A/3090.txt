Q:Does anyone know if the heap size on Android phones is a constant value according to what is set in the OS version or if this is a setting which the phone producers can decide on?

Is the heap size proportional to the amount of RAM on the phone?

I've only found articles where people say that the heap size of an application is 16M. However, these articles are a bit old. From what I see, as an example, heap sizes vary from around 20M up to 24M on one specific model. This phone has 768M of RAM.

Technically, it is a setting which the phone producers can decide on. Android is open source. I do not recall the Compatibility Definition Document spelling out heap size requirements, though I haven't looked recently.

No, it tends to be based more on screen resolution, as higher-resolution screens tend to want to manipulate larger bitmaps, so Google makes heap size recommendations that, hopefully, device manufacturers will abide by.

Searching StackOverflow on [android] "heap size" turns up this answer.
