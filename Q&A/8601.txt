Q:I have a string that is built out of three parts. The word I want the string to be (changes), a seperating part (doesn't change) and the last part which changes. I want to delete the seperating part and the ending part. The seperating part is " - " so what I'm wondering is if theres a way to delete everything after a certaint part of the string.

An example of this scenario would be if I wanted to turn this: "Stack Overflow - A place to ask stuff" into this: "Stack Overflow". Any help is appreciated!

A:For example, you could do:

String result = input.split("-")[0];


or

String result = input.substring(0, input.indexOf("-"));


(and add relevant error handling)
