Q:I have a Macbook Pro 13 inch with OS X Yosemite [Memory 8 GB, Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB]. I am trying to setup Genymotion as Android Emulator.
I installed Oracle VirtualBox first from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads [VirtualBox-5.0.0-101573-OSX.dmg], and then Genymotion for personal use from Genymotion [genymotion-2.5.0.dmg]. 

But I get the following error - 



I checked all the previous answers on StackOverflow and the Google search results, and I did the following, but none of them solved the problem.

1. 
(a) 


  sudo /Library/Startupitems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart


OR
(b)


  sudo /Library/Application\\ Support/VirtualBox/LaunchDaemons/VirtualBoxStartup.sh restart


Since my /Library/Startupitems/ is empty, I tried option (b).

2. 
Open VirtualBox -> Preferences -> Network, Under "Host-only Networks", I deleted the one that was listed.
Under "Nat Networks", there is an Active network called "NatNetwork", which is checked.

3. 
vboxmanage is added to path & has nothing under hostonlyifs

Terminal:

$ which vboxmanage
/usr/local/bin/vboxmanage

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin: <others>

$ vboxmanage list hostonlyifs
## no output - prints nothing


These are all I found through Google Search. How do I get the Genymotion working for Yosemite ? 

{ If possible, please provide a solution that is not too technical, since I am new to Mac, and it might also help people using Mac for the first time. I know this is not a new question on StackOverflow. But none of the previous posts had helped me. }

Thanks for your help.

A:I had the problem that VBoxManage was installed at /usr/local/bin/ which was not in the path for GUI apps.
I did:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/VBoxManage /usr/bin/VBoxManage
