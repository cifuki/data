Q:In reference to these questions : 

Adding gradient effect to TextView in a ListView generates NPE

and

How to change color and font on ListView

I would like to know how to go about setting the background of a TextView in a ListView with gradient effect?

In one of the questions above, I ended up having the gradient effect added to the text in the TextView. And after skimming through the second question, it seems I can add only fixed background colors.

How do I go about adding gradient to background? Should I make a CustomListAdapter?

A:You just need to create a drawable resource (see an example below), and add it to the layout you created for your ListItem.  

The drawable (in your res\\drawable folder - name it whatever - listgrad.xml for ex) could look like:

<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:shape="rectangle">
    <gradient
      android:startColor="@color/gradient_start"
      android:endColor="@color/gradient_end"
      android:angle="-270" /> 
</shape>


The you would add it to the layout for your list item (the layout.xml file you define for this) like this code snippet:




<TextView
        android:id="@+id/ranking_order"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:background="@drawable/list_grad"
        />
...
