Q:I created one android application project in eclipse and whenever I tried to run that application its throwing an error message saying AndroidManifest.xml file is missing. what is the reason for this ? 

I am using eclipse with android-sdk and ADT version is 20. in SDK manager I installed android 2.2 API level only.. Is this is the problem for that error ?

A:Delete bin folder in project and your library dependencies. Then re-run application.
