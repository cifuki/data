Q:I just updated cordova + ionic in my app, after that i installed successfully Android-SDK v22 via Android SDK manager. 

But after the running command:

cordova build android 


I always get the following message:

Running command: /Users/peter/workspace/myapp/platforms/android/cordova/build 
[Error: Please install Android target: "android-21".

Hint: Open the SDK manager by running: /Users/peter/adt-bundle-mac/sdk/tools/android
You will require:
1. "SDK Platform" for android-21
2. "Android SDK Platform-tools (latest)
3. "Android SDK Build-tools" (latest)]
ERROR building one of the platforms: Error: /Users/peter/workspace/myapp/platforms/android/cordova/build: Command failed with exit code 2

I tried also 

cordova platform rm android 
cordova platform add android 


But with the same result:

I tried to find a few hours any working solution, but with luck.

Thanks for any advice.

A:I just had the same problem.
I had to change the target: 

# Project target.
target=android-22


This should be done in two files:

myApp/platforms/android/project.properties
myApp/platforms/android/CordovaLib/project.properties

Also the manifest should be updated:

<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="14" android:targetSdkVersion="22" />
