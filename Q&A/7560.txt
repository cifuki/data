Q:I want to implement a "Google instant" like list in my app. Having an editText on top and a list below it, that is updated every time the user types in a new character.

Can you point me to the right direction? Is there any widget or anything that I could use or do I have to drop the list and recreate it each time the users types something?

Thanks in advance
Mike

A:Perhaps you are looking for an AutoCompleteTextView?
