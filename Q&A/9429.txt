Q:I am trying to add an onTouchEvent to a View, but I then see the deprecation support on this link: https://developer.android.com/sdk/support_api_diff/26.0.0-alpha1/changes/android.support.v4.view.MotionEventCompat.html.



It says, they are all deprecated. So what code should be used to replace the MotionEventCompat functions?

A:You can instead use the MotionEvent object directly to achieve the same. 

Please see the example & comparison as below:

public boolean onTouch(MotionEvent motionEvent) {
    // previously you would do this
    final int action = MotionEventCompat.getActionMasked();
    // now you would do this
    final int action = motionEvent.getActionMasked();
}


I think you are confused, as some of the Android documentation has yet to update their sample code, so some of their sample code is still using the deprecated methods. 

For more info, please read here.

Hope this helps.
