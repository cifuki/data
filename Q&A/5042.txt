Q:I have 7 devices plugged into my development machine.

Normally I do adb install <path to apk> and can install to just a single device.

Now I would like to install my apk on all of my 7 connected devices. How can I do this in a single command? I'd like to run a script perhaps.

A:You can use adb devices to get a list of connected devices and then run adb -s DEVICE_SERIAL_NUM install... for every device listed.

Something like (bash):

adb devices | tail -n +3 | cut -sf 1 -d " " | xargs -iX adb -s X install ...


Comments suggest this might work better for newer versions:

adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -iX adb -s X install ...


For Mac OSX(not tested on Linux):

adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I {} adb -s {} install ...
