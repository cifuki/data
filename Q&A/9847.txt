Q:After updating my ADT plugin to version 17 I'm getting a warning massage saying 


  Avoid hardcoding the debug mode; leaving it out allows debug and release builds to automatically assign one


There wasn't such message before the update. 

How can I avoid this warning message ?

A:Yup, just noticed this too. I removed the debuggable attribute from the manifest, and I can now both run the app in debug mode and export it to a market-ready APK file without changing any code.

Slick!
