Q:How can I install an application without any developer tools (Eclipse, Android SDK tools)?

I've compiled and created an .apk file. Now I am gonna send this apk file to my friend.

He is not an Android developer; he doesn't know how to use Eclipse or the SDK.
And I don't want to publish my application to android market.

Is there a way to launch the application on a real device without publishing it or having access to a machine with the SDK?

A:You can deploy the .apk file on your local server(apache or jboss) with a static IP to make the file available for download. Now just open the download link of the apk file in your mobile browser. The device will automatically start the installation after the download completes.
