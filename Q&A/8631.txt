Q:I'm working with the Android NDK, and since it does not currently support the STL, I was wondering if there are any brilliant people out there who have had success with this, or know which is better suited for the Android platform: uSTL or STLPort.

EDIT:
Looks like another option may be CrystaX .NET. 

From their website:


  ...customized distribution of Android
  NDK r3 which I have rebuilt from
  official sources. Support of C++
  exceptions, RTTI and Standard C++
  Library added.
