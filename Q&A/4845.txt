Q:I am using Plurals to simplify my code.  e.g., I used to have 

<string name="cat">Cat</string>
<string name="cats">Cats</string>


Using Plurals instead of multiple strings, I now have

<plurals name="cats">
    <item quantity="one">Cat</item>
    <item quantity="other">Cats</item>
</plurals>


However, I used to retrieve strings to use as titles or summaries in my XML.
e.g.,

android:title="@string/cats"


Having removed that string in favor of a Plural, I am now unsure how to retrieve my string from XML.  I did make a naive attempt with

android:title="@plurals/cats"


but this just gives me @1234567890 instead of Cats (or Cat).

Anyone know if it is possible to retrieve a string out of a Plural from XML?

A:You have to set it by code:

...setText(yourContext.getResources().getQuantityString(R.plurals.cats, catsCountVar));
