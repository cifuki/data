Q:In different Kotlin examples for Android I see toast("Some message...") or toastLong("Some long message"). For example:

view.setOnClickListener { toast("Click") }


As I understand it is an Extension Function for Activity.

How to define this toast() function and where (in what place) to be able to use it through the project?

A:It can be an extension function for Context:

fun Context.toast(message: CharSequence) = 
    Toast.makeText(this, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()


You can place this anywhere in your project, where exactly is up to you. For example, you can define a file mypackage.util.ContextExtensions.kt and put it there as a top level function.

Whenever you have access to a Context instance, you can import this function and use it:

import mypackage.util.ContextExtensions.toast

fun myFun(context: Context) {
    context.toast("Hello world!")
}
