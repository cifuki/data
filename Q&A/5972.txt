A:Genymotion proposes a shell: the Genymotion Shell. It is not currently possible to start a VM with it.

But you can however launch a Genymotion VM thanks to this command: 

player --vm-name <VM id | VM name>

This command launches the Genymotion's player that gives you access to all the Genymotion enhancements widgets (GPS, battery, rotation, ...), the screen scaling, rendering, ... Like the standard GUI launch.

If you want to use a Genymotion VM without the enhancements, you can launch it via the VirtualBox command line like this:

VBoxManage startvm gui <VM id | VM name>

The VM id can be found thanks to this command line: 

VBoxManage list vms

It displays a list of your VirtualBox machines on this format: name {id}.

UPDATE

Since Genymotion 2.5.0 you can manage all your Genymotion devices thanks to a command line tool. With this tool you can create, start, stop, delete, push files, flash the device, ...
Here is a simple example to create a device and start it:

gmtool admin create "Google Nexus 5 - 4.4.4 - API 19 - 1080x1920" myNexus
gmtool admin start myNexus
