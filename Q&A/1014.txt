Q:I am working with React-Native, Android, and Genymotion on Mac. When I run react-native run-android I get this lines at the end of the launch operation:

...
04:54:40 E/adb: error: could not install *smartsocket* listener: Address already in use
04:54:40 E/adb: ADB server didn't ACK
04:54:40 E/ddms: '/Users/paulbrie/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb,start-server' failed -- run manually if necessary
04:54:40 E/adb: * failed to start daemon *
04:54:40 E/adb: error: cannot connect to daemon
:app:installDebug FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:installDebug'.
> com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: Timeout getting device list.
...


However, adb devices returns this:

List of devices attached
192.168.59.101:5555 device


So far I've found no solution to run my app on the emulator. Has anyone encountered the same issue?

Thanks,
Paul

A:After more research I've realized that Genymotion uses by default its own adb.



I switched to my main adb (the same used by react-native) and it solved the issue. I guess that because Genymotion's adb was launched first I got the  Address already in use error message.
