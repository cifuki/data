Q:I am trying to find a fast and reliable charting library. After some searching, I found 4 libraries: AChartEngine, WilliamChart, HelloCharts and AndroidPlot. I need some up to date feedback about the performance and the stability of these libraries because all the information I could find was outdated.

A:You can use MPAndroidChart.

It's native, free, easy to use, fast and reliable.

Core features, benefits:


LineChart, BarChart (vertical, horizontal, stacked, grouped), PieChart, ScatterChart, CandleStickChart (for financial data), RadarChart (spider web chart), BubbleChart
Combined Charts (e.g. lines and bars in one)
Scaling on both axes (with touch-gesture, axes separately or pinch-zoom)
Dragging / Panning (with touch-gesture)
Separate (dual) y-axes
Highlighting values (with customizeable popup-views)
Save chart to SD-Card (as image)
Predefined color templates
Legends (generated automatically, customizeable)
Customizeable Axes (both x- and y-axis)
Animations (build up animations, on both x- and y-axis)
Limit lines (providing additional information, maximums, ...)
Listeners for touch, gesture & selection callbacks
Fully customizeable (paints, typefaces, legends, colors, background, dashed lines, ...)
Realm.io mobile database support via MPAndroidChart-Realm library
Smooth rendering for up to 10.000 data points in Line- and BarChart
Lightweight (method count ~1.4K)
Available as .jar file (only 500kb in size)
Available as gradle dependency and via maven
Good documentation
Example Project (code for demo-application)
Google-PlayStore Demo Application
Widely used, great support on both GitHub and stackoverflow - mpandroidchart
Also available for iOS: Charts (API works the same way)
Also available for Xamarin: MPAndroidChart.Xamarin


Drawbacks:


No official support for dynamic & realtime data, limited performance in that area
