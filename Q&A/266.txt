Q:I've searched around for solutions to this problem, and the only answer I can find seems to be "don't put a ListView into a ScrollView".  I have yet to see any real explanation for why though.  The only reason I can seem to find is that Google doesn't think you should want to do that.  Well I do, so I did.

So the question is, how can you place a ListView into a ScrollView without it collapsing to its minimum height?

A:Using a ListView to make it not scroll is extremely expensive and goes against the whole purpose of ListView. You should NOT do this. Just use a LinearLayout instead.
