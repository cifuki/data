Q:I have a couple of edit text boxes  on a single line. After the user types in a specific number of characters in the first I want to automatically move to the next edit text. How do I achieve this?

A:You can achieve this by using the Text Watcher class and then set the focus on the next EditText in the OnTextChanged() method of the TextWatcher.

In your case, since you have two Edit Texts, say et1 and et2. You can try out the following code:-

et1.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {

    public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start,int before, int count) 
    {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        if(et1.getText().toString().length()==size)     //size as per your requirement
        {
            et2.requestFocus();
        }
    }
    public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start,
                    int count, int after) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

    public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

});


I have not checked out the code myself, but I hope this will help you solve your problem.
