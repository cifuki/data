Q:I am new to Android and am using the Ical4j library for parsing ICS (Outlook calendar) files.

However, when I build my application in Eclipse, the following warning appears many times in the console:


  [2010-07-22 15:58:31 - Google Calendar Upload] warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class that doesn't come with an associated EnclosingMethod attribute. (This class was probably produced by a broken compiler.)


Which implications does this have? How can I resolve this?

A:This is quite common when including jar files. Although the warning isn't anything to worry about if you are just using the API normally, you should be able to get rid of them by compiling ical4j yourself from source within Eclipse (either build a new jar, or just drop the source into your own source folder). Though I should stress that unless you actually get problems, this isn't something to worry about.
