Q:Variations of this question can be found all over the internet but not an answer.

I want a seekbar with two-thumb range selection. I'm willing to program this myself but I lack experience with Android. Could someone give me some pointers on where to start. I mean, I know I will have to extend something (ProgressBar probably), but how should I go about to do that? Do I really have to recreate all the functionality of a standard seekbar, or is there an easier way?

Complete solutions are also welcome of course ;)

A:I too was  looking for this, to no avail. So I made a new widget, feel free to use it: https://github.com/anothem/android-range-seek-bar
