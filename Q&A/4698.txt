Q:I have an Android Project in Android Studio 0.5.9 and Gradle is throwing this error:

Error:The SDK Build Tools revision (17.0.0) is too low. Minimum required is 19.0.0


I have already installed SDK Build Tools Revision 19 from the SDK Manager and here is my build.gradle

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.10.+'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'android'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion 17
    buildToolsVersion "19.0.0"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 9
        targetSdkVersion 17
    }

    sourceSets {
        main {
            manifest.srcFile 'Manantiales/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml'
        }
    }
}


How do I tell gradle to use the Build Tools 19 if it's already installed?

EDIT: I marked a different answer as The Best Answer because it was the one that worked for most people

A:I had the same problem this morning after updating to .6.0. You need to change you gradle version in /projectName/build.gradle 

classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.11.+'


Open your SDK manager and download the new version of the build tools 19.1 then change the following line in /projectName/moduleName/build.gradle

android {
  compileSdkVersion 19
  buildToolsVersion "19.1" //This version needs to be updated to 19.1 after SDK update

  ...

}


Then sync your gradle files and you should be good to go!
