Q:I've been reading through the documentation for the Android Support Library, but while it explicitly says that you should include it in your Android project, it doesn't mention anything about what license the library itself is under (the only license notice present applies to the contents of the documentation page, not the code it describes). The copy spat out by Eclipse does not include any licensing information either, and queries to Google mostly just link back to the same documentation pages.

This confuses me. Should I include a notice that the code is from Google? Not put in any license notice at all? Or am I not properly understanding how the library is meant to be used? Admittedly, I am quite new to Android development.

Which states an Apache license:

And, I think apache license allows derivative works to be built and sold. Still, you should:


Include same license in source of the derived product as well.
Clearly state what parts you derived changes, built upon.


You can place this in Licence.txt or Readme.txt at the root of your project.
