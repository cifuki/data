Q:I am trying to get my android webview app to open tel: links to the phone.  Every time I open up a telephone link it works great and opens up the phone.  However once I am done with my call and go back to the app it is at a page that says "Web Page Not Found tel:0000000000".  Then I have to hit the back button once more to get to the page that I clicked the telephone number on.

Is there a way to get it to open the TEL link without trying to find the page in webview as well as opening it up on the phone?

This is code I am using in WebView to override its handling of the TEL and Mailto links:

        public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
        if (url.startsWith("mailto:") || url.startsWith("tel:")) { 
                Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW,
                        Uri.parse(url)); 
                startActivity(intent); 
                } 
        view.loadUrl(url);
        return true;
        }


Any help would be appreciated.  I have spent the last 2 hours scouring goodle and have failed to produce any answers.

A:OK so I solved the issue I think.  I just needed to separate the URL overrides as follows:

public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
    if (url.startsWith("tel:")) { 
        Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_DIAL, Uri.parse(url)); 
        startActivity(intent);
        view.reload();
        return true;
    }

    view.loadUrl(url);
    return true;
}


Now my regular links work as well as the tel links.  I can also add in there for geo: links if I need to and it will not give me the issue that I was having before to open up maps on the phone.
