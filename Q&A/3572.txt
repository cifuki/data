Q:I am working on Android project. I connected my phone to Android Studio in order to test the app. After second upload Gradle Build failed and gave this error:


  Error:Execution failed for task ':app:buildInfoDebugLoader'.
  
  Exception while doing past iteration backup : Source /home/ziyaddin/AndroidStudioProjects/Test/app/build/intermediates/builds/debug/19181584762318/classes.dex and destination /home/ziyaddin/AndroidStudioProjects/Test/app/build/intermediates/builds/debug/19181584762318/classes.dex must be different


What can be the reason for that? How to solve this problem?

A:I solved this issue by Build -> Rebuild Project  and then Run again.

Also I think newly added menu Run -> Clean and Rerun should also fix this issue.
[EDIT:] Clean and Rerun is removed in Android Studio 2.3
