Q:I am working on an app which will be full-screen, but will utilize some of the functionalities of the ActionBar. With the Ice Cream Sandwhich release, I see that I get a blue line divider/separator as part of the ActionBar. Normally, it would be good for consistency, but in my case I need to remove the divider. 

How can I remove or style the divider of the ActionBar in ICS?

Tried setting a custom theme with "android:style/Widget.Holo.ActionBar" as parent.
However, settings such as the one below has no effect

<item name="android:divider">#FFFFFF</item>

A:The graphic asset containing the blue bottom line is the background of the action bar's container view and is set to @android:drawable/ab_transparent_dark_holo when using the default Holo Dark theme.

To remove this line, you'll need to create a custom style for your action bar (based on Widget.Holo.ActionBar or Widget.Holo.Light.ActionBar (or the .Solid variants) and set the android:background to something that doesn't include the bottom border:

<style name="MyTheme" parent="android:Theme.Holo">
  <item name="android:actionBarStyle">@style/MyActionBar</item>
</style>

<style name="MyActionBar" parent="android:Widget.Holo.ActionBar">
  <item name="android:background">@drawable/your_background_here</item>
</style>


Note: Holo Dark/Light action bars have solid and transparent styles; this blue line appears by default for the transparent style. Holo Dark action bars are transparent by default and Holo Light action bars are solid by default.
