Q:I am trying to click the home icon in some Espresso tests via:

onView(withId(android.R.id.home)).perform(click());


This works fine for Android > 3.0 - but fails for older versions as appcompat does not seem to use this id for this element then. What is a good approach to do what I want to do?

A:To not depend on the app locale, you can use the code from Matt Logan by replacing "Navigate up" with R.string.abc_action_bar_up_description:

onView(withContentDescription(R.string.abc_action_bar_up_description)).perform(click());


This helped me a lot because I have an app in more than 5 languages and I had to act like this.
