Q:I created a new View class.  Within that class I need to get access to the FragmentManager, but I cannot figure out how.  

Can I access the FragmentManager from a context?

CustomView extends LinearLayout

A:Only if the given Context extends Activity (Post-Honeycomb) or FragmentActivity (pre-honeycomb).

In which case you'd have to make 100% sure it's an activity using reflection or try-catch.

try{
  final Activity activity = (Activity) context;

  // Return the fragment manager
  return activity.getFragmentManager();

  // If using the Support lib.
  // return activity.getSupportFragmentManager(); 

} catch (ClassCastException e) {
  Log.d(TAG, "Can't get the fragment manager with this");
}


Thought I recommend refactoring so a View is really just meant for showing stuff and shouldn't actually modify the state of your app, but that's my opinion.
