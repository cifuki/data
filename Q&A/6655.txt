Q:I'm having trouble with the Google Play store that insists that my app is supported by 0 devices. I've tried all the solutions I found on SO and elsewhere. This isn't about the apk being inactive, it gets activated be default and I've even tried to deactivate and reactivate it.

I've tested it on my Galaxy Nexus and it works very well, there's no reason for it to be incompatible with every single Android device...

Here's my manifest file:




<uses-sdk
    android:minSdkVersion="14"
    android:targetSdkVersion="17" />

<supports-screens
    android:anyDensity="true"
    android:largeScreens="true"
    android:normalScreens="true"
    android:resizeable="true"
    android:smallScreens="true"
    android:xlargeScreens="true" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

<uses-feature
    android:name="android.hardware.accelerometer"
    android:required="true" />
<uses-feature
    android:name="android.hardware.screen.portrait"
    android:required="false" />


The full project source can be found here: https://github.com/Nurgak/Android-Bluetooth-Remote-Control as it's open-source.

This is what I see on Google Play.


The 5 features being

android.hardware.ACCELEROMETER
android.hardware.BLUETOOTH
android.hardware.CAMERA
android.hardware.camera.AUTOFOCUS
android.hardware.TOUCHSCREEN


And 4 permissions

android.permission.BLUETOOTH
android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
android.permission.CAMERA
android.permission.INTERNET


I'm absolutely appalled by their support too, I've only gotten generic "hey have you looked at our FAQs?" replies to e-mails.

A:Try changing the apk name from com.bluetooth to com.nurgak.bluetoothremote
Try setting all the uses-feature"-tags to false
Try removing all permissions (I know the app won't work without them, but just for the sake of figuring out why Google Play says that the app supports 0 devices)



  P.S.: You don't need android.hardware.screen.portrait if you set it
  to false, anyway. It doesn't have an effect in that case.
