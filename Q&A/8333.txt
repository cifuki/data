Q:I want to read browser history in Android phone.

I have done some document reading, then I come to know that we can read browser history by android.provider.Browser class.  It has :

final static Cursor
getAllVisitedUrls(ContentResolver cr)


...method which returns Cursor.

May I get help to handle Cursor, or any example code to get browser history?

A:Not really an answer but I can tell you what I did.

I first clone the browser repo and try to reproduce how they get the history.
And I started getting:


  Permission Denial: reading
  com.android.browser.BrowserProvider


So I added:

<uses-permission android:name="com.android.browser.permission.READ_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS" />


But it still is giving me the same error. I google it and I found this Accessing Data With Android Cursors.

Hope it helps.
