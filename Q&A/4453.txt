Q:I enabled "pull to refresh" to my project using the SwipeRefreshLayout.

When I move down,  appear the loading indicator (material design style). I know, it must so work, but I want to disable this function, and start refreshing by click some button and use SwipeRefreshLayout loading indicator.

How I can to do this?

A:From the documentation:


  If an activity wishes to show just the progress animation, it should call setRefreshing(true). To disable the gesture and progress animation, call setEnabled(false) on the view.


So to show the animation:

swiperefreshLayout.setEnabled(true);
swiperefreshLayout.setRefreshing(true);


And to hide the animation:

swiperefreshLayout.setRefreshing(false);
swiperefreshLayout.setEnabled(false);
