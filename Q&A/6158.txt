Q:I have a scrollable textView, and I want to limit the number of lines displayed, however xml properties are not working :

<TextView
   android:id="@+id/tv_addesc"
   android:layout_width="match_parent"
   android:layout_height="wrap_content"
   android:scrollbars="vertical"
   android:maxLines="12"
   android:textColor="#FFFFFFFF"
   android:textSize="15sp" />


the number of lines displayed is 50 and there are 900 chars in the text.

How can I limit the number of lines displayed and make it scrollable ?

Edit : I tested with 846 lines and 15824 chars, the whole text is displayed regardless of different properties set.

Edit : there was a second component besides the textView, when i removed it it worked, so I will find a workaround. Thank you !

A:You just have to set a number of lines in your TextView like this:

android:maxLines = "10"


and you must also add:

android:minLines="1"


The rest of this not necessary if you are not using scrolling

and a property which says that this TextView should be scrollable vertically:

android:scrollbars = "vertical"


And in your Java-code:

yourTextView.setMovementMethod(new ScrollingMovementMethod())
