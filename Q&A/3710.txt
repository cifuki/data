Q:I have a ListActivity with my customized adapter. and inside each of the view, it may have some buttons, in which i need to implement OnClickListener. I need to implement the OnClickListener in the adapter. However, I dont know how to call the function like startActivity() or setResult(). since the adapter doesnt extend to Activity. 

so what is the best way to solve this problem ? thanks

A:Just pass in the current Context to the Adapter constructor and store it as a field. Then inside the onClick you can use that context to call startActivity().

pseudo-code

public class MyAdapter extends Adapter {
     private Context context;

     public MyAdapter(Context context) {
          this.context = context;     
     }

     public View getView(...){
         View v;
         v.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
             void onClick() {
                 context.startActivity(...);
             }
         });
     }
}
