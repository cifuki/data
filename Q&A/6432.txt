Q:I have an security App (App Locker) that uses this permission:

android.permission.GET_TASKS


In android Lollipop this permission is deprecated and i want that my app works in +21 API.
Can anyone guide me how?

Thnx :)

A:There is reason why it is deprecated. 
The protection Level of android.permission.GET_TASKS has been elevated to signatureOrSystem.
There is no easy and unharmful solution for that.


  As of LOLLIPOP, this method is no longer available to third party applications: the introduction of document-centric recents means it can leak personal information to the caller. For backwards compatibility, it will still return a small subset of its data: at least the caller's own tasks (though see getAppTasks() for the correct supported way to retrieve that information), and possibly some other tasks such as home that are known to not be sensitive.
