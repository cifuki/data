A:Take a look this how to use storages in android http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal

To read data from internal storage you need your app files folder and read content from here 

String yourFilePath = context.getFilesDir() + "/" + "hello.txt";
File yourFile = new File( yourFilePath );


Also you can use this approach

FileInputStream fis = context.openFileInput("hello.txt");
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis);
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(isr);
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
    sb.append(line);
}
