Q:I'm trying to publish my Android app by following the instructions here:

http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/publishing.html

However, when I run cordova build --release android I get the following error:

:lintVitalArmv7Release

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingTranslation":
   If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared
   in one language should also be translated in all other languages.

   If the string should not be translated, you can add the attribute
   translatable="false" on the <string> element, or you can define all your
   non-translatable strings in a resource file called donottranslate.xml. Or,
   you can ignore the issue with a tools:ignore="MissingTranslation"
   attribute.

   By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a
   subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You
   can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the
   environment variable ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS.

   You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language
   in your res/values/ folder by specifying tools:locale="languageCode" for
   the root <resources> element in your resource file. (The tools prefix
   refers to the namespace declaration http://schemas.android.com/tools.)

  <string name="menu_settings">???????</string>

    * What went wrong:
    Execution failed for task ':lintVitalArmv7Release'.
    > Lint found fatal errors while assembling a release target.

      To proceed, either fix the issues identified by lint, or modify your build script as follows:
      ...
      android {
          lintOptions {
              checkReleaseBuilds false
              // Or, if you prefer, you can continue to check for errors in release builds,
              // but continue the build even when errors are found:
              abortOnError false
          }
      }
      ...

    * Try:
    Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

I can run ionic build android and deploy to an emulator without problem.

I've tried searching for lintOptions and build.gradle but I can't find them anywhere in my project...

Can anyone help? Thanks in advance

A:Solved this by adding

lintOptions {
    abortOnError false
}


to the android {} section in /platforms/android/build.gradle
