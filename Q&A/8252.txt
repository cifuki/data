A:Please notice that section:


  Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':_armv7DebugCompile'.


It can happen because building an android project with the crosswalk plugin try to build two apks : one for ARM, the other for x86.

The solution is to install Android Support Repository :


Open the SDK manager (from command line, type android).
Under Extras, Make sure you have Android Support Repository and Google Repository downloaded.
