Q:This sounds like there should be a solution for it all over the internet, but I am not sure why I cannot find it. I want to disable Horizontal scrolling on mobile devices. Basically trying to achieve this:

body{
   overflow-x:hidden  // disable horizontal scrolling.
}


This may be relevant information: I also have this in my head tag, because I also do not wish the user to be able to zoom:

<meta content='width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;' name='viewport' />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />


Thanks

A:html, body {
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
body {
  position: relative;
}


The position relative is important, and i just stumbled about it. Could not make it work without it.
