Q:If I get the image name as a variable like following:

var imageName = SERVICE.getImg();


Then, how can I get the resource with R.drawable.????, I tried R.drawable[imageName], but it failed. Any suggestions?

A:int id = getResources().getIdentifier(imageName, type, package);


This will get you the ID of the resource you are looking for.  With it, you can then access the resource from the R class.

Using only the name parameter:

You can also include all the 3 info in the "name" parameter using the following format: "package:type/image_name", something like:

int id = getResources().getIdentifier("com.my.app:drawable/my_image", null, null);


This is useful when you're working with external components or libraries that you can't, or don't want to, change how getIdentifier() is called. e.g.: AOSP Launcher3
