Q:I have just written a game for the Google Play Store and would like to remind my customers to leave feedback on the market for the application (especially the demo version). Is there any way to launch the market intent in a mode that will take the user to the feedback / comments section of the page?

I already use this approach for linking my demo to the paid application... 

Intent goToMarket = null;
goToMarket = new Intent(
                   Intent.ACTION_VIEW,
                   Uri.parse("market://details?id=com.paulmaidment.games.flagsoftheworld"));
startActivity(goToMarket);


Is there a best practice?

Additionally, is there any way to track referrals from my demo application so that I can try to calculate some kind of a conversion rate? (that is, how effective the demo application is at generating sales.)

A:I'm not sure if its possible for an intent to take a user directly into the feedback/comments section. The developer guide does not mention that possibility.

As for tracking referrals you might want to check out this:
