Q:I've been working on push notifications and I am able to implement it and display it on status bar, the problem I am facing is that I want to display it even if the phone is lock, Under the lock screen where it says ("drag to unlock"), I have seen notifications like that but cant find any example to that.

Example:
Just like when you received a missed call , it will show it under the lock button on your screen.

Code:

String ns = Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(ns);
int icon = R.drawable.icon_launcher;
CharSequence tickerText = "MyApplication";
long when = System.currentTimeMillis();
Notification notification = new Notification(icon, tickerText, when);
notification.defaults |= Notification.DEFAULT_SOUND|Notification.DEFAULT_VIBRATE|Notification.DEFAULT_LIGHTS;;
CharSequence contentTitle = this.title;
CharSequence contentText = this.message;
Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, notificationIntent, 0);
notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, contentTitle, contentText, contentIntent);
mNotificationManager.notify(NOTICE_ID, notification);

A:Have you tried creating the alertdialog with a flag? The  flag_show_when_locked should do the trick.
