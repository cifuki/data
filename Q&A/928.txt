Q:I have installed Android Studio on my MacBook Air (OS Version 10.11 El Capitan) and have successfully written a small "hello, world" app and installed on device (Nexus 7) and ran on AVD.  All I want to do now is be able to build the app and install it on device from the command line as opposed to Android Studio.  I'm following the directions here:

http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html

and the relevant line is:

Make sure the Android SDK platform-tools/ directory is included in your PATH environment variable, then execute:

The problem is I can't find the Android SDK on my machine!  I assume it's there because otherwise the program wouldn't compile and run through Android Studio?  Perhaps that's a bad assumption?  I'm new to Macs (I'm used to Windows) so I don't know the best way to search for the Android SDK.  So my questions:


How do I find Android SDK on my machine? Or prove to myself it's not there?
If it's not there how do I install it?
How do I change PATH to include Android SDK?

A:1. How to find it

Open Android studio, Goto Android Studio>Preference Search for sdk And something similar to this(This is a windows box as you can see) will show

You can see the location there, most of the time it is /Users/<name>/Library/Android/sdk

2. How to Install It,If not there

Just go-to Android Standalone sdk download page , download the zip file for OSX and extract it to a directory


3. How to add it to the path

Open your terminal application and open paths file in nano by typing 

sudo nano /etc/paths


Input your password,Go to the end of the lines and input the directory path. And you want to add:
eg:- 

/Users/username/Libs/android-sdk-mac_x86/platform-tools




Save it by pressing Ctrl+X, Restart the terminal application and To see if it is working or not - type in the name of any file or binary which are inside the directories that you've added and verify it is opened/executed
