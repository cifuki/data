Q:I am using a drawable as a background of a TextView just to have a divider line below the text. A achivied it with this drawable-xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
    <item>
        <shape 
        android:shape="rectangle">
            <solid android:color="#FFDDDDDD" />
            <gradient 
                android:angle="0"
                android:startColor="#FFAAAAAA"
                android:endColor="#FFEEEEEE"
                />
        </shape>
    </item>

    <item android:bottom="2dp">
        <shape 
        android:shape="rectangle">
            <solid android:color="#FF000000" />
        </shape>
    </item>

</layer-list>


But this method draws a colored rectangle above a black rectangle. I would like to have just the line at the bottom of the shape with no black rectangle because black is not transparent. How could I achieve that?

A:In general, I try to mess as little as possible with backgrounds unless absolutely necessary, since doing so overrides the default background colors that have states for focused, pressed, etc. I suggest just using an additional view (in a vertical LinearLayout) that is as thick as you need it to be. For example:

 <View 
       android:background="#FF000000" 
       android:layout_height="2dp" 
       android:layout_width="fill_parent"/>
