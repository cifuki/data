Q:When using setDuration() for a Toast, is it possible to set a custom length or at least something longer than Toast.LENGTH_LONG?

A:The values of LENGTH_SHORT and LENGTH_LONG are 0 and 1.  This means they are treated as flags rather than actual durations so I don't think it will be possible to set the duration to anything other than these values.

If you want to display a message to the user for longer, consider a Status Bar Notification.  Status Bar Notifications can be programmatically canceled when they are no longer relevant.
