Q:Update: GCM is deprecated, use FCM


I am implementing Google Cloud Messaging in my application. Server code is not ready yet and in my environment due to some firewall restrictions I can not deploy a test sever for push notification. What I am looking for is a online server which would send some test notifications to my device to test my client implementation.

A:Found a very easy way to do this.

Open http://phpfiddle.org/

Paste following php script in box. In php script set API_ACCESS_KEY, set device ids separated by coma.

Press F9 or click Run.

Have fun ;)

<?php


// API access key from Google API's Console
define( 'API_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR-API-ACCESS-KEY-GOES-HERE' );


$registrationIds = array("YOUR DEVICE IDS WILL GO HERE" );

// prep the bundle
$msg = array
(
    'message'       => 'here is a message. message',
    'title'         => 'This is a title. title',
    'subtitle'      => 'This is a subtitle. subtitle',
    'tickerText'    => 'Ticker text here...Ticker text here...Ticker text here',
    'vibrate'   => 1,
    'sound'     => 1
);

$fields = array
(
    'registration_ids'  => $registrationIds,
    'data'              => $msg
);

$headers = array
(
    'Authorization: key=' . API_ACCESS_KEY,
    'Content-Type: application/json'
);

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt( $ch,CURLOPT_URL, 'https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send' );
curl_setopt( $ch,CURLOPT_POST, true );
curl_setopt( $ch,CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers );
curl_setopt( $ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true );
curl_setopt( $ch,CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false );
curl_setopt( $ch,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode( $fields ) );
$result = curl_exec($ch );
curl_close( $ch );

echo $result;
?>


Note: While creating API Access Key on google developer console, you have to use 0.0.0.0/0 as ip address.  (For testing purpose). 

Edit:

In case of receiving invalid Registration response from GCM server, please cross check the validity of your device token. You may check the validity of your device token using following url:

https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN

Some response codes:

Following is the description of some response codes you may receive from server.

{ "message_id": "XXXX" } - success
{ "message_id": "XXXX", "registration_id": "XXXX" } - success, device registration id has been changed mainly due to app re-install
{ "error": "Unavailable" } - Server not available, resend the message
{ "error": "InvalidRegistration" } - Invalid device registration Id 
{ "error": "NotRegistered"} - Application was uninstalled from the device
