Q:I am developing one app, and what I think I wanna do is receive data from server database in android. So I started to run some tutorials. I found one that is doing pretty much what I want. 
But I am getting: 

detailMessage   "failed to connect to localhost/127.0.0.1 (port 8080): connect failed: ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)" (id=830021648792) 


Whole code of this tutorial is here link

Error occurs on : 

OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream());

I checked that:


firewall is disabled
ping is working
connection string is exactly the same as when I run the servlet from server admin interface - http://localhost:8080/Requestor/RQSRV
-the servlet is running 


My configuration :


Server : Glass Fish 4.0
Android App - Developed in Eclipse
Servlet - Developed in NetBeans

A:To access your PC localhost from Android emulator, use 10.0.2.2 instead of 127.0.0.1. localhost or 127.0.0.1 refers to the emulated device itself, not the host the emulator is running on.

Reference: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking#networkaddresses

For Genymotion use:  10.0.3.2 instead of 10.0.2.2
