Q:I am integrating OAuth login for Google+ on my android application, following the tutorial.

According to the tutorial, I should add the Google Service plugin by adding
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.0' dependency to top-level  build.gradle  in my android project.

However, when I sync the gradle with the changes, I see the error as follows:


  Error:Could not find com.google.gms:google-services:1.0.
  
  Searched in the following locations:
      file:/C:/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/gradle/m2repository/com/google/gms/google-services/1.0/google-services-1.0.pom
      file:/C:/Program Files/Android/Android  Studio/gradle/m2repository/com/google/gms/google-services/1.0/google-services-1.0.jar
      https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/google/gms/google-services/1.0/google-services-1.0.pom
      https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/google/gms/google-services/1.0/google-services-1.0.jar


In my build.gradle:

// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.0'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}


It seems that the android studio is not able to find google-services plugin from repositories. 

Does anybody have the same issue? Or, am I missing something?

A:I ran into the same issue today. In the samples they use this line instead:

classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.3.0-beta1'

This works.
