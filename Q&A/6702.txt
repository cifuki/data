Q:I am a new Mac user. I searched everywhere for debug.keystore file, but no luck. Is it possible that eclipse can't create the file?

A:The default location is /Users/<username>/.android/debug.keystore.

Go into Finder, navigate to your home directory, then press Command+Shift+G and in the pop-up type .android - you'll see all files there.
