i have been following this thread How to install Google Play Services in a Genymotion VM (with no drag and drop support)? but when i dragged and dropped these files after showing file transfer in progress it is simply copying these files to my genymotion mobile memory card. Its not asking to flash it. 
Please help me how can i install google apps on my genymotion emulator

Open Genymotion
Play the device
