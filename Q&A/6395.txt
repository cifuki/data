Q:I know there is the ExpandableListView but it only supports up to 2 levels. I need a true treeview vertical list with at least up to ~5 levels (more is better).

Any suggestions?

edit:

I see talk about using a Custom Adapter and setting the padding based on the items level.

I have an unsorted ArrayList of objects that have an ID and parent ID, and I dynamically add items to this array as well. 

Can anyone give me some examples of how I can go about doing this?

A:I had the same issue. You can check out my implementation AndroidTreeView. 



Its N-level tree.
Custom style for nodes
Save state after rotation
