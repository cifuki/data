Q:I have an Android ListView created with a SimpleAdapter that has more items in it than fit in the screen.  After the list has been scrolled, I need to get the position in the data model of the first visible item in the list.  

Basically I want a function like: listView.getChildAt(0).getPositionInDataModel().

Adapter has a few functions in it, like getItemId(position) that looked useful; however, the SimpleAdapter implementation just returns the passed in position, not a row id like I'd hoped.  

A brute force solution would be to get the View at index 0, and compare it to the view for each item in the adapter.  However, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get the view for a particular position from the adapter.

Anyone have any thoughts?

A:It's very easy. Just use ListView.getFirstVisiblePosition() + indexYouWant. For instance, to get the position in the adapter of the 2nd child displayed in the ListView, just use getFirstVisiblePosition() + 1.

No need for all the scary stuff shown in the reply above :)
