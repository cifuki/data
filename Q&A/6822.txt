Q:I searched for similar questions on this issue but found none related to Mac OSX.

Situation:
Trying to test android apps on a Galaxy S (Details below) but Mac is not detecting the device. Tried all the things below and have wondered whether this might be a driver issue (which I've heard things about for Samsung USB debugging). 

Questions: 
1) Are samsung drivers required for android USB debugging? 
2) And are they available for Mac OSX?
3) Any other reasons OSX might not detect device for usb debugging?

Things I tried:


Enabled USB Debugging @ Settings >> Applications >> Development >> USB Debugging
Enabled Tethering @ Settings >> Wireless and network >> Tethering >> USB
Tethering
Set Tethered mode @ Settings >> USB connection >> Tethered mode
Attempt to detect devices via ./adb devices (from platform
tools dir)
Verified that "Unknown Sources" is checked @ Settings >> Applications >> Unknown Sources
Verified that device is connected to Mac
Restarted phone
Restarted mac
Added various device / product ids to adb_usb.ini
Did ./android update adb (which does adb kill-server / start-server)


Using:
Samsung Galaxy S (4G) with Sprint
Mac OSX 10.6.8
Eclipse Classic 3.7.1

A:Have you tried connecting the phone using a powered USB hub? I haven't tried it yet but found this blog post that suggests it may help for Samsung Galaxy devices.
