Q:I just recently updated my IntelliJ Idea installation on my Mac to 10.5.  I had an Android project that I was working on in 10.0.3 and everything was working great.  Now when I try to build the project I am getting an Error:

Information:Compilation completed with 1 error and 0 warnings
Information:1 error
Information:0 warnings
Error:Android SDK is not specified for module Project_Android

A:It sounds like IntelliJ doesn't know where the Android SDK is.

Here is a step by step:


From your existing project, go to 'File' -> 'Project Structure'
Click 'Modules' entry from the 'Project Settings' group (on the left side)
Click 'Android' module for your project
Click 'New' where it says 'Android Platform'
Point it to the Android SDK location that you have locally.
Select an API version.
Click 'Apply'


That should be it.  Good luck!
