Q:I have moved from Eclipse to Android Studio recently, and am liking it. However, I miss the Javadoc on hover feature from Eclipse.

I followed the instructions here to add the functionality, however, my hovers contain no Javadoc. If I use my documentation shortcut Ctrl + Shift + Space it will show the documentation correctly, however, I really want it to come up in the Tooltip.

Below is a screenshot of what I see. Clearly, there should be a Javadoc on this method.



I see this on all methods/variables. Any help is appreciated.

A:Turns out the docs hover page was simply resized to be very short. Carefully moving the mouse down to the bottom of the hover page allowed me to resize it.

Even after resizing it though, I still see it return to it's tiny size quite often... I'm glad I have my docs back, even if it does mean dealing with this annoyance.
