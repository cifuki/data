Q:For an unknown reason, I can't get my application leaving properly so that when I push the home button and the app icon again, I resume where I was in the app. I would like to force the application to restart on the first Activity.

I suppose this has something to do with onDestroy() or maybe onPause() but I don't know what to do.

A:Here is an example to restart your app in a generic way by using the PackageManager:

Intent i = getBaseContext().getPackageManager()
             .getLaunchIntentForPackage( getBaseContext().getPackageName() );
i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
startActivity(i);
