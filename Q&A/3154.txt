Q:I'm attempting to build my first F# Android project in Visual Studio 2017 (Community Edition).

Immediately after creating a new project by using the F# - Android - Blank App template, the error window in Visual Studio displays the following message:


  The project Foo is missing Android SDKs required for building. Double-click on this message and follow the prompts to install them.


No amount of double-clicking on the message causes prompts to appear.

I can't find an obvious place to download the Android SDK from:

The SDK manager that I remember from a while ago seems to have disappeared from the Android developer website.

I've installed Android Studio, which seemed to download some Android SDKs, but Visual Studio still can't seem to find whatever it's looking for.

A:I had the same issue... and  Tools -> Android -> Android SDK Manager was greyed out for me.

In the end I needed to go to Tools -> Options -> Xamarin -> Android Settings  and then make sure that the "Auto Install Android SDKs" was ticked.  Once I ticked this and then double clicked on the error the install window suddenly appeared.

Per teapeng's answer, you may need to restart Visual Studio for this change to take effect.
