Q:The title is pretty self explaining.

The following code does not render shadow below the Floating Action Button. What can be done to render shadow? Is this feature really not supported even on API 21+?

<android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_add"
    android:clickable="true" />


Note: Adding android:elevation does not add shadow on API 21.

A:Simply setting app:borderWidth="0dp" resolve this issues for me.

Note: don't forget to add xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto" to your root layout.

This issue should be fixed in next release of android design library.
