Q:I am thinking of implementing the Android Volley library in my next projects (Google IO presentation about Volley).

However, I haven't found any serious API for that library.

How do I upload files, do POST/GET requests, and add a Gson parser as a JSON parser using Volley?

A:Edit: finally here it is an official training about "Volley library"

I found some examples about Volley library


6 examples by Ognyan Bankov : 


Simple request 
JSON request 
Gson request 
Image loading 
with newer external HttpClient (4.2.3) 
With Self-Signed SSL Certificate.

one good simple example by Paresh Mayani
other example by HARDIK TRIVEDI
