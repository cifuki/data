Q:According to the documentation,


  Called when activity start-up is complete (after onStart() and
  onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle) have been called). Applications will
  generally not implement this method; it is intended for system classes
  to do final initialization after application code has run.
  
  Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation
  of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown.


It is not advised to use this method. However, I use it to tweak some elements after onCreate. I see that some people use it to do something between onResume() and they are advised not to do this as they cannot rely on this method (due to its bad documentation). 

So, can I use the tweaking here (it does not rely on onResume at all)?
Do you ever use this method and when/why?

A:As the documentation states, onPostCreate is mostly intended for framework use. The question is: What do you intend to do in onPostCreate() that you can't do in onCreate() or onResume() (i.e. what exactly does "tweaking some elements" mean)?

I am not using it, as I see no reason to do so - all I need to do can be done in onCreate or onResume. However Google itself uses it in it's TabActivity for instance.
