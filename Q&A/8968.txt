Q:I have an Activity_1 after a lot of steps, say

Activity_2 > Activity_3 .... in some Activity_n I change some data related to Activity_1 and call it using

Intent intent = new Intent(Activity_n.this, Activity_1.class);
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
startActivity(intent);


To refresh the content. But later I can go all the way back to Activity_1 where I started, which has old data.

Instead I want the initial Activity_1' s onResume() to be called, using the above code. Or appropriate Flag

FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP


  consider a task consisting of the activities: A, B, C, D. If D calls
  startActivity() with an Intent that resolves to the component of
  activity B, then C and D will be finished and B receive the given
  Intent, resulting in the stack now being: A, B.


That' what the docs say, but not what I am getting.

A:You can add this two lines and try

intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);


Write this in your manifest file inside Activity 

<activity
     android:name=".SettingsActivity"
     android:launchMode="singleInstance"
     android:screenOrientation="portrait" >
</activity>


"singleTask" and "singleInstance" activities can only begin a task. They are always at the root of the activity stack. Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time \xe2\x80\x94 only one such task.

You can use SingleTask or SingleInstance

"singleTask"    -   The system creates the activity at the root of a new task and routes the intent to it. However, if an instance of the activity already exists, the system routes the intent to existing instance through a call to its onNewIntent() method, rather than creating a new one.

"singleInstance"    -   Same as "singleTask", except that the system doesn't launch any other activities into the task holding the instance. The activity is always the single and only member of its task.
