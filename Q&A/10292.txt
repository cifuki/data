Q:There are several questions about accessing dual SIM features through the Android SDK, all of which are answered with brief statements that such features are unsupported in Android.

In spite of this, dual SIM phones do exist, and applications like MultiSim seem to be able to detect this in some kind of manufacturer-independent way.

So, beginning with that acknowledgement, let me try to ask some more pointed questions:


Does "Android SDK does not support multiple SIM features" mean that these features do not exist, or that it is merely a bad idea to try to use them?
Is there an Android content provider or an internal package (com.android...) that provides SIM card information? (TelephonyManager, as far as I can see in the docs and the code, has no mention of multiple SIM cards)
Is there any report of any manufacturer exposing multiple SIM features to developers?
If I were to look for undocumented functionality from a manufacturer, how would I go about that?


(By the way, the point of all of this is merely to implement this algorithm: send an SMS with SIM card 1; if delivery fails, switch to SIM card 2 and resend the message that way.)

A:Android does not support multiple SIM features before API 22. But from Android 5.1 (API level 22) onwards, Android started supporting multiple SIMs.  More details on Android Documentation
