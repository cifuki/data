Q:I'm not referring to textInput, either. I mean that once you have static text in a TextView (populated from a Database call to user inputted data (that may not be Capitalized)), how can I make sure they are capitalized?

Thanks!

A:I should be able to accomplish this through standard java string manipulation, nothing Android or TextView specific.  

Something like:

String upperString = myString.substring(0,1).toUpperCase() + myString.substring(1);


Although there are probably a million ways to accomplish this.  See String documentation.
