Q:I have an Activity named whereActity which has child dialogs as well. Now, I want to display this activity as a dialog for another activity.

How can I do that?

A:To start activity as dialog I defined it like this in AndroidManifest.xml:

<activity android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog" />


Use this property inside your activity tag to avoid that your Dialog appears in the recently used apps list 

android:excludeFromRecents="true"


If you want to stop your dialog / activity from being destroyed when the user clicks outside of the dialog:

After setContentView() in your Activity use:

this.setFinishOnTouchOutside(false); 

Now when I call startActivity() it displays as a dialog, with the previous activity shown when the user presses the back button.

Note that if you are using ActionBarActivity (or AppCompat theme), you'll need to use @style/Theme.AppCompat.Dialog instead.
