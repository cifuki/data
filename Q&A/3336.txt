Q:I just downloaded and installed the new Android SDK. When I start the emulator, on the emulator screen it says "Hardward Buttons not enabled in AVD". There are Home, Menu, etc are all disabled. How do I make these buttons enabled?

A:You'll need to modify the Device Definitions. To do this, find the "Device Definitions" tab in the Android Virtual Device Manager and double click on the device you're using.

Make sure the Buttons are set to Hardware.



Don't forget to update your device settings:
