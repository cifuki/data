Q:I have created an Activity with a AutuCompleteTextView[ACTV] and button. I enter some text in the ACTV then press the button.
After I press the button I want the Activity to go to another Activity. In the second Activity I just want to display the text entered in ACTV(of the first actvity) as a TextView.  

I know how to start the second activity which is as below:

Intent i = new Intent(this, ActivityTwo.class);
startActivity(i);


I have coded this to obtain the text entered from the ACTV.

AutoCompleteTextView textView = (AutoCompleteTextView) findViewById(R.id.autocomplete);
CharSequence getrec=textView.getText();


My question here is how to pass "getrec" (after I press the button) from the first Activity to the second. And later recieve "getrec" in the second activity.

Please assume that I have created the event handler class for the button by using "onClick(View v)"

A:You can use Bundle to do the same in Android

Create the intent:

Intent i = new Intent(this, ActivityTwo.class);
AutoCompleteTextView textView = (AutoCompleteTextView) findViewById(R.id.autocomplete);
String getrec=textView.getText().toString();

//Create the bundle
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();

//Add your data to bundle
bundle.putString(\xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d, getrec);

//Add the bundle to the intent
i.putExtras(bundle);

//Fire that second activity
startActivity(i);


Now in your second activity retrieve your data from the bundle:

//Get the bundle
Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();

//Extract the data\xe2\x80\xa6
String stuff = bundle.getString(\xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d);
