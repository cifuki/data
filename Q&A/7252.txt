  Android: How to get the sender of an Intent?  




Is there a way in android to find the source activity which fires a INTENT (in the destination activity)?

The scenario is I have two activities A and B. Both fire an intent to call activity C. 
Activity C displays extra information based on its source. Eg. If call comes from A then C displays only 2 textviews whereas in the case of intent fired by B the activity C displays 3 textviews (basically more information based on who is the caller).

To establish this I need to know who fired the intent calling C. How do I do this?

A:A better way to do this would be to use Intent extras to pass parameters to the receiver.
