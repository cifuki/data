Q:I am using a custom ListView with RatingBar and ImageButton. Here is my problem: When I click on my ListView, my OnItemClickListener is not working. Please can any one help me.
Code:

ListView lv = getListView();
setContentView(lv);
lv.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> arg0, View arg1, int position, long arg3) {
        Toast.makeText(SuggestionActivity.this, "" + position, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});


Thanks in advance!

A:Though a very old question, but I am still posting an answer to it so that it may help some one.
If you are using any layout inside the list view then use ...

android:descendantFocusability="blocksDescendants"    


... on the first parent layout inside the list. This works as magic the click will not be consumed by any element inside the list but will directly go to the list item.
