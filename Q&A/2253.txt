Q:Is there any API or tool that enables me to automatically upload an APK to Google Play? I want to automatically publish customized apps to my account without any manual steps or graphical interface.

I searched around but could not find any API for doing this (only android-publisher but it doesn't support publishing, despite its name). Did anyone solve this already, seems like a basic feature?

A:As of today there is a new official publishing API That allows you to upload to any channel (ie. alpha, beta...) or update title and description and more.

From the docs:


  
  Uploading new versions of an app  Releasing apps, by assigning APKs to various Tracks (alpha, beta, staged rollout, or production)
  Creating and modifying Google Play Store listings, including
  localized text and graphics and multi-device screenshots
