Q:I created with Adobe Flash an .apk app through Air for Android. 
Now I would like to make it ready for the Blackberry App World with this Blackberry online packager: https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/android/bpaa/apk-compatibility-check

Where to I find the Android SDK folder on my Windows PC? Is it bundle with the Adobe Flash Pro installation?

A:You can find the path in the Android SDK Manager.
On the top it lists the path, the default path in Windows is

C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk


and on Linux

/home/YourName/Android/Sdk/
