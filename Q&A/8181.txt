Q:I have an application using navigation drawer that provides list of locations. In the drawer, there are several options (like choosing country, city, etc) that user can setup before showing the corresponding list in the main activity.

Is there any possibility to refresh the list when user close the drawer, or maybe there is another way to solve this? I've tried to search for tutorials but found nothing about this drawer closed listener.
Any suggestions would be helpful, thanks!

A:When you setup the ActionBarDrawerToggle you can "implement" the onDrawerClosed and onDrawerOpened callbacks. See the following example from the Docs:

mDrawerToggle = new ActionBarDrawerToggle(this, mDrawerLayout,
            R.drawable.ic_drawer, R.string.drawer_open, R.string.drawer_close) {

        /** Called when a drawer has settled in a completely closed state. */
        public void onDrawerClosed(View view) {
            super.onDrawerClosed(view);
            // Do whatever you want here
        }

        /** Called when a drawer has settled in a completely open state. */
        public void onDrawerOpened(View drawerView) {
            super.onDrawerOpened(drawerView);
            // Do whatever you want here
        }
    };
// Set the drawer toggle as the DrawerListener
mDrawerLayout.addDrawerListener(mDrawerToggle);


Edit: Now the setDrawerListener is deprecated, use addDrawerListener instead.
