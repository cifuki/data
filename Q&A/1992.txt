Q:I am currently trying to design a simple app that streams an internet radio station. I have the URL for the station and am setting up the Media Player like

    MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
    try {
        mediaPlayer.setDataSource(URL);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    try {
        mediaPlayer.prepare();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    mediaPlayer.start();


The program isn't crashing when emulated, but nothing is playing and I am get the following error:

start called in state 0


and right below it is

Error (-38,0)


Does anyone know what this means? 

I've read a little about these state errors, but couldn't find anything that applies to my project.

A:You need to call mediaPlayer.start() in the onPrepared method by using a listener.
You are getting this error because you are calling mediaPlayer.start() before it has reached the prepared state.

Here is how you can do it :

mp.setDataSource(url); 
mp.setOnPreparedListener(this);
mp.prepareAsync();

public void onPrepared(MediaPlayer player) {
    player.start();
}
