Q:I've been doing some research for a mathematical Android related project I'd like to embark upon and I stumbled across for the first time MathML. 

Does anyone know of any Java libraries which can do any (preferably all) of the following things?


Parse MathML
Output MathML by parsing standard mathematical notation
Render MathML (particularly important)
Do any other cool maths-ey things (like re-arrange equations in terms of different things)


Number 3 is probably the most important, and number 4 the least.

Thanks in advance.

A:I've used JEuclid for rendering MathML in my Symja project (Java symbolic math system - point 4 of your list).
JEuclid may be too slow (especially at startup) to render MathML on a mobile phone.

Other alternatives for rendering math expressions with TeX:


JMathTex
SnuggleTeX
JLaTeXMath


and for re-arranging equations or as general Java math libraries:


Mathrider (Yacas for Java)
Jasymca - Symbolic Calculator for Mobile Devices
Java Algebra System
The Apache Commons Mathematics Library
