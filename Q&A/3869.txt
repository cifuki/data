A:Use

button.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(left, top, right, bottom);

Sets the Drawables (if any) to appear to the left of, above, to the right of, and below the text. Use 0 if you do not want a Drawable there. The Drawables' bounds will be set to their intrinsic bounds.

If you use 

button.setCompoundDrawables(left, top, right, bottom);

Sets the Drawables (if any) to appear to the left of, above, to the right of, and below the text. Use null if you do not want a Drawable there. The Drawables must already have had setBounds(Rect) called.
