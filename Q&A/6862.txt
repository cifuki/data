Q:I'm hitting an external API that's returning JSON data (new dvd titles).  I'm able to parse out the JSON and list each dvd title and other dvd information into a ListView just fine.  I was also able to setup an onListItemClick method just fine for primitive data (title string).  I ended up writing something like so for the onListItemClick method:

Just to note, the productArray is a class var that's being set by another method that holds an array of JSONObjects.  

protected void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) {
    super.onListItemClick(l, v, position, id);

    Intent i = new Intent(DvdListingActivity.this, MovieProductActivity.class);
    try {
        JSONObject jsonObj = productArray.getJSONObject(position);
        i.putExtra("mTitle", jsonObj.getJSONObject("Title").opt("val").toString());
        i.putExtra("mRelDate", jsonObj.getJSONObject("RelDate").opt("val").toString());
        i.putExtra("mDesc", jsonObj.getJSONObject("Desc").opt("val").toString());
        i.putExtra("mRating", jsonObj.getJSONObject("MPAA").getJSONObject("Rating").opt("val").toString());
        i.putExtra("mActors", jsonObj.getJSONObject("Actors").opt("val").toString());
        i.putExtra("mImage", jsonObj.getJSONObject("Image").opt("val").toString());
        startActivity(i);

    } catch (JSONException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }       

}


The above code all works, but I'm thinking there's GOTTA be a better way for me to pass in data to another Activity.  I was thinking that I would be able to pass a JSONObject that contains all the data for a dvd movie instead of setting each data point individually.  

I tried for a week and a half to figure out how to use Parcelable.  I tried instantiating a new JSONObject jsonObj  that implements Parcelable with no luck.  I kept getting an error in my LogCat that said that the object was un-parcelable.

I've tried reading the Android developer site and other blogs, but I couldn't apply their examples to what I needed to do.

Any help would be much appreciated

A:You can just encapsulate all of the information about a movie into a Movie object, which implements Parcelable.

The code will look similar to above, but instead of passing 6 different extras you can just pass one extra that is the movie.

Movie movie = new Movie();
movie.setTitle(jsonObj.getJSONObject("Title").opt("val").toString());
movie.setRelDat(jsonObj.getJSONObject("RelDate").opt("val").toString());
.
.
.
i.putExtra("movie", movie);


For information on implementing a Parcelable object, see Parcelable docs.  You basically just write out each string in 'writeToParcel', and read in each string in 'readFromParcel' in the correct order.
