Q:I load an image into an ImageView using .setImageURI(selectedImageUri) that is retrieved from the user's photo gallery. I have the image view restrict the size with 

android:maxHeight="150dp"
android:minHeight="150dp" 
android:maxWidth="150dp" 
android:minWidth="150dp"


It's fine up until the you add the image from the gallery. The image then forgets about the max height and width. It is as wide as the display and there is a lot of space above and below the image. I had to add a scrollview just to see the image and scroll down. there is an even amount of space above and below. Has anyone run into this problem before?

A:Add the following to your XML code (Or use the appropriate function)

android:adjustViewBounds= "true"


I don't know why this isn't a default, because it seems like it would be required for a large number of items. Still, adding this simple logic to your XML file will make all of the difference.
