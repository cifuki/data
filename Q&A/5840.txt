Q:I have used ndk successfully to build & use a .so file in one project. I need to use this library in another project. I would rather not copy the source there, but just use the library. 

Trying to copy & paste the whole libs/armeabi/libcommon.so to the project root does not work, I think because libs/armeabi is an android generated path.

So what would be the best way to do it?

I am using Eclipse-Galileo & ndk5.

A:There is a much simpler way to do all of this. 

Let's say that your prebuilt library is called "libprebuilt.so"

In the project folder of the new project you want to only include the prebuilt library, do something like:

mkdir -p jni/libprebuilt
cp libprebuilt.so jni/libprebuilt


Then, just create a jni/libprebuilt/Android.mk file:

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := libprebuilt
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := libprebuilt.so
include $(PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY)


Then when you do ndk-build, it will copy this library in to libs/armeabi/ ... that's all!
