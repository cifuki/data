Q:When I attempt to run my application in Eclipse on my device, I've started getting alot of com.android.ddmlib.SyncException: Too many open files exceptions/errors in the console. 

Why is this and what does it mean? What can I do to stop this?

A:Essentially, that means you have a memory problem.  More than likely it is a leak.

First restart your phone and verify you are still getting the error.  If so you are going to need to start digging in your code and find out where you are leaking!

Need more help?  Post some code!
