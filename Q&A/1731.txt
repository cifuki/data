Q:How do I force the screen to stay active and not shut off while my app is running?

A:PLEASE DO NOT USE A WAKE LOCK

This requires that you give your app an additional permission, and it is very easy to introduce bugs where you accidentally remain holding the wake lock and thus leave the screen on.

It is far, far better to use the window flag FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON, which you can enable on your activity's window in your onCreate() like this:

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle icicle) {
    super.onCreate(icicle);

    getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);
}


This will make sure that the screen stays on while your window is in the foreground, and only while it is in the foreground.  It greatly simplifies this common use case, eliminating any juggling you need to do as your app transitions between states.
