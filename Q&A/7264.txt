Q:I have just updated Android studio 2.2.2 to 2.3 from the canary channel. After downloading completed and applying path file, the android studio is restarting.
But after restarting android studio I am getting below error with dialog:


  Cannot load project:
  com.intellij.ide.plugins.PluginManager$StartupAbortedException:
  com.intellij.diagnostic.PluginException: Could not initialize class
  org.jetbrains.kotlin.android.actions.NewKotlinActivityAction [Plugin:
  org.jetbrains.kotlin]


See below screenshot for to get more idea:



After closing dialog by ok and restarting android studio, also I can't able to open my project or creating new project.



Does anyone is facing same issue after updating android studio?

A:Disable the Kotlin plugin and restart Android Studio. I had the same error even after I updated the plugin. So disabling seems to be the solution for now -- unless you're using Kotlin, I guess.

The Kotlin team confirmed a fix is in the works via twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin/status/797111726516879360
