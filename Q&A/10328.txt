Q:I just started learning Kotlin for android development and started an empty project and added an activity. I have added the required gradle dependencies as said in Kotlin docs. By default the xml file of MainActivity contains only a TextView. But when I try to preview the xml in Layout Editor it shows a "Render Error" 

Render problem

Failed to load AppCompat ActionBar with unknown error.


Also I'm getting this

The following classes could not be instantiated:
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatImageView (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.widget.ActionBarContainer (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatTextView (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.widget.ActionBarContextView (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.app.WindowDecorActionBar (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)
-\xc2\xa0android.support.v7.widget.ActionBarOverlayLayout (Open Class, Show Exception, Clear Cache)


Exception Details java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: android.support.v4.view.TintableBackgroundView


I have tried rebuilding the project and refreshing layout manually. But nothing seems to work. 

So what do I do? I'm using Android Studio 3.0 Canary 2 with Kotlin

EDITED:

I have made some progress. I have found that none of my AppCompat Themes are working.

A:Well, check your gradle , have you added support:appcompat dependency in app/build.gradle file ?  also appcompat:design dependency
