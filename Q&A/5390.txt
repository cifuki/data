Q:Is there a way to dynamically change the starting activity in Android based upon a conditionally?  What I attempted to do (that didn't work) was the following:


remove the LAUNCHER category as defined in my AndroidManifest.xml
create a custom Application class that the app uses
override the onCreate method of my Application class to define some code like the following:


.

if (condition) {
    startActivity(new Intent(this, MenuActivity.class));
} else {
    startActivity(new Intent(this, LoginActivity.class));
}

A:Why not have an initial Activity with no UI that checks the condition in its onCreate, then launches the next Activity, then calls finish() on itself?  I've never called finish() from within onCreate() though, so I'm not sure if this will work.

EDIT
Seems to work fine.  Here's some code to make it clearer.
Initial Activity:

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    Intent intent;
    if (condition) {
       intent = new Intent(this, ClassA.class);
    } else {
       intent = new Intent(this, ClassB.class);
    }
    startActivity(intent);
    finish();
    // note we never called setContentView()
}


Other Activity:

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
}
