Q:I am following the standard example of how to add a RatingBar. To control the number of stars I tried to use android:numStars="5". The problem is that the number of stars doesn't seem to do anything at all. In portrait-layout I get 6 stars and when I flip the phone I get about 10 stars. I tried to set the number of stars in my Activity (myBar.setNumStars(5)) that loads the xml but there was no success with that option either. 

So my question is how do I define my layout so that it will only show five stars? Set numStars doesn't seem to work.

Thanks in advance,
Roland
