Q:I'd like to publicate my app to GooglePlay but first i would like to do a last testing with the signed apk to ensure that all of the used API keys are working correctly with the release version (GMaps, Facebook, etc)

So i just made a signed version of my app with our release key and when i try to install the app to the device i got an error:



I have tried to copy the apk to the device and install it with an apk installer app.

Strange thing is when i do the same process with debug signing key, all is well, I can install and run the app.

Here are the steps of the procedure:

I select the release key, type password.



I do select release build type instead of debugging



Just in case i also defined in the gradle file the signing keys but I must admit i dont know is it necessary.



I tried like 7 seven times now so i assume this problem is not just a 
mistyped password, also I can make this work with the standard debug android signing key.

Please help if you can.

A:You may be using the android 5.0 or above device. 

Just go to the Settings --> Apps --> Click on your App. ---> In App info page at the action bar menu there will be an option called " Uninstall for All users " click that. Your app will be completely uninstalled and now you can try installing the new version with no issue. Hope this will help you
