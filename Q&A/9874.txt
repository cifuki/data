Q:I'm new in gradle and cannot find any documentation about this feature. 

All I noticed is that
compile 'com.github.asne:asne-vk:0.2.1' caused some manifest merging problems (some grunting abot different minSdkVersions) and that compile 'com.github.asne:asne-vk:0.2.1@aar' works fine.

A:The AAR format 


  is the binary distribution of an Android Library Project.


As described  here in the official Android Tools documentation.

In your case, when adding a compile dependency in an Android Gradle project, adding "@aar" means that you would like to fetch the @aar file and not a regular JAR file.
