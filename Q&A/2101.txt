I need to turn off the WiFi a while after pressing the "Turn off the Screen" button. There is a need for this app for my tablet because sometimes I just forget to turn off the WiFi and this discharges the battery very fast. It lives 10x+ times less than I would without WiFi. 
Is there any solution available as .apk? Can I track when the screen turned off and 5 min elapsed? Can I programmatically turn off WiFi on Android device? How?

A:You need the following permissions in your manifest file:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"></uses-permission>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE"></uses-permission>


Then you can use the following in your activity class:

WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) this.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE); 
wifiManager.setWifiEnabled(true);
wifiManager.setWifiEnabled(false);


Use the following to check if it's enabled or not

boolean wifiEnabled = wifiManager.isWifiEnabled()


You'll find a nice tutorial on the subject on this site.
