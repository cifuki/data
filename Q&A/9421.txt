Q:In my android application, I have an Activity that has 3 or 4 fragments that can be attached in sequence based on some user or server events.

I would like to track all these fragments as screens in firebase.

So ideally, if possible, is there an API i can invoke in the onCreate of the fragments, and tell firebase that user is currently in fragment1, fragment2 or fragment3?

A:There is a special method to set a current screen - setCurrentScreen

I used it as follows

mFirebaseAnalytics.setCurrentScreen(this, fragment.getClass().getSimpleName(), fragment.getClass().getSimpleName());


Once the method is called, the following message appears in the LogCat


  Logging event (FE): screen_view(_vs),
  Bundle[{firebase_event_origin(_o)=auto,
  firebase_previous_class(_pc)=HomeFragment,
  firebase_previous_id(_pi)=4121566113087629222,
  firebase_previous_screen(_pn)=HomeFragment,
  firebase_screen_class(_sc)=StatisticsFragment,
  firebase_screen_id(_si)=4121566113087629223,
  firebase_screen(_sn)=StatisticsFragment}]


The following event appears on auto activity tracking:


  Logging event (FE): screen_view(_vs),
  Bundle[{firebase_event_origin(_o)=auto,
  firebase_previous_class(_pc)=StatisticsFragment,
  firebase_previous_id(_pi)=4121566113087629223,
  firebase_previous_screen(_pn)=StatisticsFragment,
  firebase_screen_class(_sc)=LoginActivity,
  firebase_screen_id(_si)=4121566113087629224}]


As you see, they are almost the same, so setCurrentScreen is working.

I'm able to see those classes in Firebase Console only on the next day. It is normal for Firebase - it takes time to process such amounts of data.
