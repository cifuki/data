Q:I have an ImageView. I am using imageView.setImageBitmap to set my image as background to ImageView. But it sets my image to ImageView's source (i.e. android:src) , but it doesn't set my image to ImageView's background (i.e. android:background).

When I use imageView.setImageBitmap, it looks like as if I used imageView.setImageResource not imageView.setBackgroundResource. 

How can I handle this if I want to set my image to background using imageView.setImageBitmap. I know by I can do this by making custom ImageView. But is it possible without custom ImageView? If its possible, please let me know how to do it.

A:I have tested and it's done

I think you are getting Bitmap

So you have to convert Bitmap to BitmapDrawable

like

  BitmapDrawable ob = new BitmapDrawable(getResources(), bitmap)


then just set bitmap with below function 

  imageView.setBackgroundDrawable(ob);


by this way you can do it..
