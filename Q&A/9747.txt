Q:I would like to test the behavior of my application when the user is in a no-signal zone or when his phone is in flight mode.

-> How do I put an Android Virtual Device into offline mode (where no connection to the internet is possible) ?

I have tried the following:


Activating flight mode via the AVD settings: surprisingly, this does NOT work (browsing  the internet is still possible in flight mode!)
Disabling the network connection on my PC: this obviously works, but is not satisfactory as I need Internet when I am testing my app

A:I'm seeing all the same problems.  DDMS doesn't fully kill it.  Neither does F8.  And neither does turning on airplane mode inside the emulator.  We should all probably star this issue someone logged in 2009.
