Q:I have very slow bandwidth, so I'm trying to keep all the required files on the local machine to work with Android Studio completely offline. When I click on "New Project" it always tries to download a file named gradle-1.6-bin.zip which I downloaded and tried to install locally via the plugin manager but it gives me an error:   


  fail to load plugin descriptor from file gradle-1.6-bin.zip


So what other files do I need to download and how do I install them properly to work offline with Android Studio?

A:Android Studio 0.4.0 now includes support for offline:

"You can now open the Compiler > Gradle options and enable Offline mode, which will tell Gradle to ignore update-to-date checks"

Updated Nov 2018:
Now you can Open preferences, then search for "offline" and in the results select gradle and click "Offline work"
