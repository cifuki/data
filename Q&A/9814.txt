Q:How do you set the time zone in Crashlytics? It's showing in UTC now, and I don't see the setting that allows you to change it.

A:For instance, there is no way to do that. 

Today, I've received an email from Crashlytics' support team where they informed that this request is already on their roadmap. On the other hand, they still don't have any idea when this feature will be launched.
