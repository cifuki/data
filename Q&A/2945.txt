Q:After update Android Studio to latest version (3.1) and gradle version in my project I get an error (the link is always different):

Android Studio version:

Android Studio 3.1
Build #AI-173.4670197, built on March 22, 2018
JRE: 1.8.0_152-release-1024-b02 amd64
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o
Windows 10 10.0


I already tried clean rebuild and update gradle, restart Android Studio and PC, but without success. Any ideas?

PS: of course I have internet. Also, if you open a link in the browser - the file is downloaded.
