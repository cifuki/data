Q:I'd like my app to upload an image to a web server. That part works.

I'm wondering if it's possible to somehow show the progress of the upload by entering an entry in the "notification bar". I see the Facebook app does this.

When you take a picture and choose to upload, the app lets you continue on, and somehow puts the picture upload notifications in a progress bar in the notification bar. I think that's pretty slick. I guess they spawn a new service or something to handle the upload and update that progress bar in the notification bar every so often.

Thanks for any ideas

A:You can design a custom notification, instead of just the default notification view of header and sub-header.
