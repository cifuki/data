Q:I have a requirement wherein I want to detect two kind of events related to Calls in Android


Whenever an outgoing call is made, my application should get to know this along with the called number
When the call is hanged up(due to success/failure), my application should get to know this along with the reason of hangup


Is this possible in Android?

A:You should create a BroadcastReceiver:

public class CallReciever extends BroadcastReceiver {

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

        if (intent.getStringExtra(TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE).equals(
                TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE_RINGING)) {

                // Phone number 
                String incomingNumber = intent.getStringExtra(TelephonyManager.EXTRA_INCOMING_NUMBER);

                // Ringing state
                // This code will execute when the phone has an incoming call
        } else if (intent.getStringExtra(TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE).equals(
                TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE_IDLE)
                || intent.getStringExtra(TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE).equals(
                        TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE_OFFHOOK)) {

            // This code will execute when the call is answered or disconnected
        }

    }
}


You should register you application to listen to these intents in the manifest:

<receiver android:name=".CallReciever" >
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE" />
            </intent-filter>
 </receiver>
