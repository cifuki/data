Q:When a crash occurs in an application installed via the Google Play app, user's have the option to Send Feedback.



A user can optional write feedback to describe the problem they have encountered and then submit their crash report.


Is the written feedback provided by the user available anywhere in the Google Play Console?
Can the feedback be associated with a stack trace of the crash the user encountered?

A:After talking with google support iv received this answer - 

"The console has been updated since the IO and some of the function you had in the past is now redundant."

Google has removed the "crash feedback" in the latest update.
