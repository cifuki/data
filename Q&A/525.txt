Q:I'm trying to use the TextView constructor with style like this:

TextView myText = new TextView(MyActivity.this, null, R.style.my_style );


however, when i do this, the text view does not appear to take the style (I verified the style by setting it on a static object).

I've also tried using myText.setTextAppearance(MyActivity.this, R.style.my_style) but it also doesn't work

A:I do not believe you can set the style programatically. To get around this you can create a template layout xml file with the style assigned, for example in res/layout create tvtemplate.xml as with the following content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="This is a template"
        style="@style/my_style" />


then inflate this to instantiate your new TextView:

TextView myText = (TextView)getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.tvtemplate, null);


Hope this helps.
