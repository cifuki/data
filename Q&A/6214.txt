Q:Android supports an event onLongPress.  The question I have is 'how long' (in milliseconds) is the 'press' to trigger the event?

A:The standard long press time is what is returned by getLongPressTimeout(), which is currently 500ms but may change (in 1.0 it was 1000ms but changed in a later release; maybe in the future it will be user-customizable).

The browser uses its own long press time because it has some more complicated interactions.  I believe this should be 1000, though again it may change in the future.  It is not adding the different timeouts together.
