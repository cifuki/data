Q:I'm trying to load a bitmap in Android which I want to tile. I'm currently using the following in my view to display a bitmap:

canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, srcRect, destRect, null)


I essentially want to use this bitmap as a background image in my app and would like to repeat the bitmap in both the X and Y directions.

I've seen the TileMode.REPEAT constant for the BitmapShader class but i am not sure if this is to be used for repeating the actual bitmap or is used for applying a filter to the bitmap.

A:You would do this in the xml instead of the java code. I haven't attempted this myself but I did find this example.

<xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
android:id="@+id/MainLayout"
xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
android:layout_width="fill_parent"
android:layout_height="fill_parent"
android:orientation="vertical"
android:background="@drawable/backrepeat"
>


then in an xml called backrepeat.xml

<bitmap xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:src="@drawable/back" 
    android:tileMode="repeat" />
