Q:In my app, user writes a phone number, and I want to find the contact name with that phone number?

I usually search the contacts like this:  

Cursor cur = getContentResolver().query(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI,
            null, null, null, null);


But I do this to access all contacts... In this app I only want to get the contact name of the given phone number... How can I restrict the query?

Or do I have to go trough all contacts and see if any has the given phone number? But I believe that this can be very slow this way...

A:You should have a look at the recommended ContactsContract.PhoneLookup provider

A table that represents the result of looking up a phone number, for example for caller ID. To perform a lookup you must append the number you want to find to CONTENT_FILTER_URI. This query is highly optimized.

Uri uri = Uri.withAppendedPath(PhoneLookup.CONTENT_FILTER_URI, Uri.encode(phoneNumber));
resolver.query(uri, new String[]{PhoneLookup.DISPLAY_NAME,...
