Q:I'm trying to figure out how to define a vertical line (1dp thick) to be used as a drawable.

To make a horizontal one, it's pretty straightforward:

<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:shape="line">
    <stroke android:width="1dp" android:color="#0000FF"/>
    <size android:height="50dp" />     
</shape>


The question is, how to make this line vertical?

Yes, there are workarounds, such as drawing a rectangle shape 1px thick, but that complicates the drawable XML, if it consists of multiple <item> elements.

Anyone had any chance with this?

UPDATE

Case is still unsolved. However,

UPDATE

I found no other way other than the one that I marked as correct. It does the trick though feels a bit "heavy", thus if you happen to know the answer don't forget to share ;)

A:Instead of a shape, you could try a View:

<View
    android:layout_width="1dp"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:background="#FF0000FF" />


I have only used this for horizontal lines, but I would think it would work for vertical lines as well.

Use:

<View
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="1dp"
    android:background="#FF0000FF" />


for a horizontal line.
