Q:I am starting to play around with Property Animations over view animations as I have a view that needs to scale and push others out of the way as it does. I've seen some examples but I'm just wondering if there is anywhere that provides a list of the properties that can be altered using these classes. For example, I saw one tutorial that did a quick rotation using:

ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(aniView, "rotation", 360)


Which is quite cool, but I wouldn't have known the rotation property if not for that exact tutorial, is there any comprehensive list of what can be done? The particular property I want to animate is the weight of a view within a LinearLayout, if anyone has any advice on that specifically.
