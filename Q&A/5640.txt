Q:I can't figure out how to get the Key Hash required to use the Facebook Android SDK. I figured out that I can use keytool with these commands:

  keytool -exportcert -alias [alias]
 -keystore [keystore] | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl enc -a -e


The only problem is that I have no idea where to insert this, I tried through command windows (win7) and I tried opening the file keytool.exe.

A:Download and install OpenSSL from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html based on windows 32 or 64 bit.(Note: Download and install first visual C++ 208 redisributable from that site also )
Put the bin directory of installed OpenSSL in windows path.
Open the command prompt and go to C:\\Users{User_Name}.android
now put this command on cmd "keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64".(refer https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started#samples)
Now enter password "facebook" without double quote.
Now a hash key will be generated 

Finally go to the Facebook Developer site. Make sure you are logged into Facebook and, using the dropdown menu in the top-right, go to your 'Developer Settings':
Once you're in your developer settings, select 'Sample App' from the navigation on the left, and add and save your key hash into your profile:
