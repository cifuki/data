Q:How can I use properly the Intent flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION in AndroidManifest file? I supose my problem is trivial, but I can't find good example or solution to it.

<intent-filter>
    <data android:name="android.content.Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION" />
</intent-filter>


However no error is reported by compliator, but data isn't correct.
I just want to disable animation in case switching between activities. I can use getWindow().setWindowAnimations(0); in onCreate or onResume rather but using flag is better way, isn't it?

I can use also in code:

Intent intent = new Intent(v.getContext(), newactivity.class);
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
getContext().startActivity(intent);


But I want to use this flag in Android Manifest. To disable animation also in case returning from second activity to first.

A:You can create a style, 

 <style name="noAnimTheme" parent="android:Theme">
   <item name="android:windowAnimationStyle">@null</item>
</style>


and set it as theme for your activity in the manifest:

   <activity android:name=".ui.ArticlesActivity" android:theme="@style/noAnimTheme">
    </activity>


You can also define a style to specify custom entry and exit animations.
