Q:I need to create a qrcode in my android application, and I need a library or source code that lets me create a QR Code in an Android app.

The library I need must:


not leave a watermark (like onbarcode library)
not use web service API to create the qrcode (like Google's library zxing)
not need 3rd party installers (like QR Droid)


I already created such code for iPhone (Objective-C) but I need a quick fix for Android until I have time to make a QR Code generator of my own. It's my first android project so any help will be appreciated.

A:Have you looked into ZXING?
I've been using it successfully to create barcodes.
You can see a full working example in the bitcoin application src

// this is a small sample use of the QRCodeEncoder class from zxing
try {
    // generate a 150x150 QR code
    Bitmap bm = encodeAsBitmap(barcode_content, BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE, 150, 150);

    if(bm != null) {
        image_view.setImageBitmap(bm);
    }
} catch (WriterException e) { //eek }
