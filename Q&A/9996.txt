Q:I have a selector for textColor of a RadioButton like this:

<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:state_selected="true" android:color="#fff"/>
    <item android:state_focused="true" android:color="#f00"/>
    <item android:state_pressed="true" android:color="#0f0"/>
    <item android:state_focused="false" android:state_pressed="false" android:color="#00f"/>
</selector>


I expected that the one selected RadioButton will have different color than the others.

However, all of the RadioButtons have blue text (using android:state_focused="false" android:state_pressed="false"), even the one that is selected. 

What am I doing wrong?

A:It looks like you're just using the wrong selectors.  The docs describe selecting as follows: 


  During each state change, the state list is traversed top to bottom and the first item that matches the current state is used\xe2\x80\x94the selection is not based on the "best match," but simply the first item that meets the minimum criteria of the state.

So, in order:


state_selected is never true as RadioButtons use state_checked
when checked.
state_focused is never called because RadioButton
will never receive input focus.
state_pressed should be working. 
When you hold your finger down you don't see the text appearing
green?
state_focused false and state_pressed false ends up being
default so you see blue.


If you would like to see different states, try these:

<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:state_pressed="true" android:color="#0f0"/>
    <item android:state_checked="true" android:color="#fff"/>
    <item android:color="#00f"/>
</selector>


I have tested the above and can see all colors being expressed appropriately.
