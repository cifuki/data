A:Copied From Android Docs : 


  Caution: A service runs in the main thread of its hosting process\xe2\x80\x94the
  service does not create its own thread and does not run in a separate
  process (unless you specify otherwise). This means that, if your
  service is going to do any CPU intensive work or blocking operations
  (such as MP3 playback or networking), you should create a new thread
  within the service to do that work. By using a separate thread, you
  will reduce the risk of Application Not Responding (ANR) errors and
  the application's main thread can remain dedicated to user interaction
  with your activities.


Services overview

Use IntentService if you don't want to fiddle with managing threads on your own. Or use AsyncTasks.
