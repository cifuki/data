Q:I have an Android project developed on Eclipse (GNU/Linux) that I last touched half a year ago. I am trying to import the project into Eclipse 3.6 on Windows (with ADT installed) installed using File -> Import Project in Eclipse. When the project is imported, I see the following error twice on the console:


  [2010-12-10 02:17:12 -
  com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.internal.project.AndroidManifestHelper]
  Unable to read C:\\Program
  Files\\Android\\android-sdk-windows\\AndroidManifest.xml:
  java.io.FileNotFoundException:
  C:\\Program
  Files\\Android\\android-sdk-windows\\AndroidManifest.xml
  (The system cannot find the file
  specified)


Why is Eclipse looking for AndroidManifest.xml on the Android SDK path? The file actually seems to be in the project's directory.  How do I fix this problem and get the project to compile?

A:The way you are importing the Android project into Eclipse is wrong. The Correct way of doing is File -> New Android Project. In the Contents Tab in "New Android Project", select "Create project from existing source" and choose the Build Target. That should fix your problem.
