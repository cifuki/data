Q:I have installed Genymotion on my Windows 7 , 32-bit machine. I am working with Eclipse to develop Android apps. I would like to ask what the proper way to install the Genymotion plug-in is.  

Going by their website, they provide two JAR files for Eclipse and a note underneath which reads:  


  The installation of the plugin can be done by launching Eclipse and
  going to "Help / Install New Software" menu, then just add a new
  Update Site with the following URL:
  http://plugins.genymotion.com/eclipse. Follow the steps indicated by
  Eclipse.  Warning: to use this plugin, Genymotion must be installed on
  your system.  


I have installed the plug-in from the Eclipse 'Help' menu. I havent downloaded any of the two files. Have I done it correctly ?  

The two files are:
1. Genymotion Plug-in for Eclipse
2. Mandatory dependency for Eclipse plug-in
