Q:I have an ImageView on which I have applied a rotate animation. Since I want the rotation to go on continuously, I gave the repeatCount as infinite in my rotate.xml:

android:repeatCount="infinite"


In onCreate(), I load the animation and start it.

Animation myAnim    = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this, R.anim.rotate);
objectImg.startAnimation(myAnim); 


When a button is pressed, the rotation must stop. Hence in my onClick(), I called clearAnimation().

objectImg.startAnimation(myAnim); 


My simple question is whether stopping the animation is the right thing to do. 
I assume clearAnimation() corresponds to loadAnimation(), but there is no stopAnimation() that corresponds to startAnimation().

A:You can also call anim.cancel(); but you should also call anim.reset(); immediately after it.
Then when you want to start it again, just call startAnimation on the view.
