Q:What is the difference between System.gc() and Runtime.gc()?

A:Both are same. System.gc() is effectively equivalent to Runtime.gc(). System.gc()internally calls Runtime.gc(). 

The only difference is System.gc() is a class method where as Runtime.gc() is an instance method. So, System.gc() is more convenient.
