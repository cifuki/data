Q:I want to find device specification of a mobile phone  for examples, the device manufacturer, model no ( and may be types of sensors in the device, wifi chipset etc..). I want to get the device manufacture/model number (eg. Samsung GT-I9100 i.e Galaxy S2) programmatically. The manufacture/model number is also used in Google Play when installing an app. I want to use this information to make some configuration changes in my hardware dependent app (for eg. power measurement).
