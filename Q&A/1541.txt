Q:I am planning to develop an augmented reality application for Android phone. Does anyone know if there is any existing framework for augmented reality which could be used for such applications?

A:For ideas, you could look at the following:

Existing Apps and their APIs:
There are number of Augmented Reality applications in the Android market of which Layar and Wikitude are well known. Others like SomaView and GeoVector also exist. AFAIK, Wikitude and Layar have made their API's public.

Toolkit:
There is also a toolkit named, NyARToolkit that provides a library for such a thing.
