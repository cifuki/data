Q:I am trying to add the add SDK Platform 1.6 to an existing Install of 2.2, with the help of this thread.

As suggested, I ran Help \xe2\x86\x92 Check for Updates which found and installed the following:

  + Android DDMS              8.0.1.v201012062107-82219
  + Android Development Tools 8.0.1.v201012062107-82219


It prompted for restarting Eclipse and when it restarted it gave me the following error message:

"SDK Platform Tools component is missing!
Please use the SDK Manager to install it."


Huh? Why? I still have the SDK Platform Tools on C:\\android-sdk-windows that was working perfectly before I did this "upgrade".

What do I need to have both 2.2 and 1.6 supported in my development environment?

A:OK, here is what I did to fix the problem:

Open Eclipse. Then:
  Window > Android SDK and AVD Manager
   > Available Packages: 
     > Android Repository:
       + Android SDK Tools, revision 8
       + Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 1

[Install Selected]
