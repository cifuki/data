Q:Has anybody had any success with developing for Android platform using Netbeans (5.5+ ) IDE? I know of atleast netbeans one plugin that is supposed to support it but wanted to hear if anyone is using netbeans for Android development and how easy it is to set it up.

A:There is a project called nbandroid (formerly called undroid) which is a Netbeans version of ADT and it works quite fine with SDK 1.0

http://nbandroid.org/

In the past it was hosted at undroid.nolimit.cz and nbandroid.kenai.com, both these sites are obsolete now.
