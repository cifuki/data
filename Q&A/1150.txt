Q:With Retrofit 2, you can set a full URL in the annotation of a service method like : 

public interface APIService {
  @GET("http://api.mysite.com/user/list")
  Call<Users> getUsers();
}


However, in my app, the URL of my webservices are not known at compile time, the app retrieves them in a downloaded file so i'm wondering how i can use Retrofit 2 with full dynamic URL.

I tried to set a full path like : 

public interface APIService {
  @GET("{fullUrl}")
  Call<Users> getUsers(@Path("fullUrl") fullUrl);
}

new Retrofit.Builder()
  .baseUrl("http://api.mysite.com/")
  .build()
  .create(APIService.class)
  .getUsers("http://api.mysite.com/user/list"); // this url should be dynamic
  .execute();


But here, Retrofit doesn't see that the path is actually a full URL and is trying to download http://api.mysite.com/http%3A%2F%2Fapi.mysite.com%2Fuser%2Flist

Any hint of how I could use Retrofit with such dynamic url ?

Thank you

A:I think you are using it in wrong way. Here is an excerpt from the changelog:


  New: @Url parameter annotation allows passing a complete URL for an endpoint.


So your interface should be like this:

public interface APIService {
    @GET
    Call<Users> getUsers(@Url String url);
}
