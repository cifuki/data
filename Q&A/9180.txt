Q:I have several Views on an Activity which a user wants to touch quickly in succession and I capture these touches using a TouchListener and handling MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN. However, if the user is using two hands, it's very likely that the next View will be 'Touch'ed before the user pulls the previous finger up. In this scenario, a MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE is fired for the first view rather than the desired MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN for the second view.

Is there any way to work around or prevent this behavior? I've tried dispatching a new event with MotionEvent.ACTION_UP and also removing the event listener but neither seem to work.

A:The easiest way I found to force single touch across an entire app is to set it using a theme:

<style name="MyTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Holo.Light">
    <item name="android:windowEnableSplitTouch">false</item>
    <item name="android:splitMotionEvents">false</item>
</style>


Manifest:

  <application
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:theme="@style/MyTheme" >
