Q:What is the difference? The android documentation doesn't have a description for notifyDataSetInvalidated(). I was thinking maybe you call that function to notify all registered listeners, but use notifyDataSetChanged() to not notify them?

A:Changed means the data set changed. Individual items updated, or items were added or removed. Invalidated means the data source is no longer available.
