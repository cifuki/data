I am using Eclipse classic to develope my Android applications. But I am not able to see any messages in the logcat. Till yesterday it was showing each and every message but now it is not showing anything. I have written a lot og log statements to trace my program, but because of this I am not able to trace.

Can anybody say where is the problem? Thanks...

A:Try these first


Go to the device tab, click your device. and go back to the logcat
tab
You might have filter set.
You are probably viewing the wrong package.
