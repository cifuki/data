Q:I would like to use new version of Intent.createChooser method which uses IntentSender. 

Documentation states only that I can grab it from PendingIntent instance. In my case it seems that PendingIntent won't have any other use.

Is there another way to obtain IntentSender or do I need create PendingIntent?

A:the chooser target intent is not the PendingIntent. For instance, in the following snippet, I am declaring intent for  ACTION_SEND, with type text/plain, and this is the my target intent for the Intent.createChooser. Then I am creating another Intent, receiver, and a handler, the PendingIntet, which will invoke onReceive of my BroadcastTest after one pick something from the chooser. 

Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "This is my text to send.");
intent.setType("text/plain");
Intent receiver = new Intent(this, BroadcastTest.class);
receiver.putExtra("test", "test");
PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, receiver, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(intent, "test", pendingIntent.getIntentSender());
startActivity(chooser);


Edit: 

The information, in the case of the BroadcastReceiver is embedded in the intent you get as parameter. After you selected one of the option, retrieve the Bundle's extras and using the key android.intent.extra.CHOSEN_COMPONENT, you should be able to find what the user picked.

Try adding as simple Log.d to onReceive 

for (String key : intent.getExtras().keySet()) {
    Log.d(getClass().getSimpleName(), " " + intent.getExtras().get(key));
}


In my example I got 

ComponentInfo{org.telegram.messenger/org.telegram.ui.LaunchActivity}

for Telegram and 

ComponentInfo{com.google.android.apps.inbox/com.google.android.apps.bigtop.activities.ComposeMessageActivity}


for InBox
