Q:i am creating login in my app. User type his info i send it to web service to check and get his ID. Now i need to save it somewhere in my app that i could check if he had login. 

So where this info should be saved ? I know that every app have it's settings so there should be this info ? Maybe someone could give me more info what and how this is doing.

Thanks.

I found this post:
What is the most appropriate way to store user settings in Android application

I believe my question was duplicate. But it would be nice if you have something to share more.

A:First of all save user info like uname & password in SharedPreferences with this code.

SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences("UserInfo", 0);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit();
editor.putString("Username",txtUname.getText().toString());
editor.putString("Password",txtPWD.getText().toString());
editor.commit();


and then get SharedPreferences from below code

SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences("UserInfo", 0);
txtUname.setText(settings.getString("Username", "").toString());
txtPWD.setText(settings.getString("Password", "").toString());
