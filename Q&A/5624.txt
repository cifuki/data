Q:I have a JAVA_HOME variable set to: 


  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45\\
  And the path to the jdk is:
  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45


However when I try to start android studio I get the error: 


  No JVM installation found. Please install a 64 bit JDK. If you already
  have a JDK installed define a JAVA_HOME variable in Computer > System
  Properties > System Settings > Environment Variables.

A:It says that it should be a 64-bit JDK. I have a feeling that you installed (at a previous time) a 32-bit version of Java. The path for all 32-bit applications in Windows 7 and Vista is:

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\


You were setting the JAVA_HOME variable to the 32-bit version of Java. Set your JAVA_HOME variable to the following:

C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45


If that does not work, check that the JDK version is 1.7.0_45. If not, change the JAVA_HOME variable to (with JAVAVERSION as the Java version number:

C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdkJAVAVERSION
