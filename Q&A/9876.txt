Q:I'm trying to make my horizontal layouts take advantage of the room available.

In an info showing activity I have a 'fact box' followed by a large box of text. I'd like the infobox to float right, similar to the following picture.

Is this possible using the android TextView api?

A:I would suggest employing a WebView for this. You can format the text in a web view with the usual HTML / CSS formatting, with which your desired layout is pretty simple to accomplish.
