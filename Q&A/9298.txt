Q:At a certain point of my AsyncTask, after some validations have been done, I need to spawn off another thread to do some other work. So I'd like two background threads at this point, each doing it's own thing (approx 2-3 seconds to execute each). The idea is to maximize performance on dual core processors like Atrix.

Is it acceptable to create another asynctask & execute it from the first one? Can anyone suggest a better way of doing this?

Thanks!

EDIT: I'm wondering what publishProgress() from the second task would even do... since it was not started from an Activity?

Yes, but only inside onProgressUpdate() or onPostExecute() since these methods runs on the UI thread. Therefore, start the second AsyncTask on the UI thread by choosing one of the two methods listed above.

It does exactly the same thing, since you are starting it from the UI thread.
