Q:I have implemented ads in one of my apps and I want to make a in-app purchase feature to remove them. How would I do this.

I was thinking a simple way, was to hide the ads by making in invisible, after purchase. Could that work or is there an easier/better way?

I have no idea how to use the in-app feature for any purpose. Could anyone show me the way to code or something to read on this?

A:It depends on how you inserted the ads in the first place. If you did it via code, then just put an if(removed ads == false) around the code that inserts ads.

If you did it via XML, then the best way to do it is to copy out your XML, without the adview, and in your code use if surrounding all of your setContentView(R.layout.example)

Here's an example of what I mean

if (adsDisabled == true){
    setContentView(R.layout.mainNoAds)
} else{
    setContentView(R.layout.main
}

In this post I assumed you are using admob, but the same should be true for all companies

On last thing - using adView.View.GONE IS bad practice **DO NOT ** do that
