Q:I just installed the Android Eclipse Plugin and the Android SDK from Google yesterday. I open the AVD Manager window by going to Window -> Android Virtual Device Manager. I then click "New" and am presented with the "Create new Android Virtual Device (AVD)" window. The problem is, I can't get the "OK" button to not be greyed out. I choose Nexus 7 from "Device", I give the AVD a name, I choose "Android 4.2 API Level 17" as the target. And no matter what I do for the rest of the settings, the "OK" button continues to be greyed out. I am not presented with any errors. Any idea as to what I may be missing and why the window would not allow me to proceed by clicking "OK"?

A:You either haven't selected a CPU/ABI target in the dropdown below the target, or you haven't installed a system image.  Open your SDK manager and ensure that you've installed ARM EABI v7a System Image under the Android 4.2 section.
