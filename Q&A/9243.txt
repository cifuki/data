Q:I'm not asking how to handle touch events, but what is going on behind the scenes? If there are several nested widgets, what order do they see the events in? Does the developer have any control over it? Ideally I would like a document on the subject.

A:From Activity viewpoint:

Touch events are delivered first to Activity.dispatchTouchEvent. It's where you may catch them first.

Here they get dispatched to Window, where they traverse View hierarchy, in such order that Widgets that are drawn last (on top of other widgets) have chance to process touch in View.onTouchEvent first. If some View returns true in onTouchEvent, then traversal stops and other Views don't receive touch event.

Finally, if no View consumes touch, it's delivered to Activity.onTouchEvent.

That's all your control. And it's logical that what you see drawn on top of something else, has chance to process touch event before something drawn below it.
