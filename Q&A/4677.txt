Q:Where can I download Eclipse Android Bundle? Google now directed you to download Android Studio or to download Eclipse SDK integration but I want to find Eclipse Android bundle. I searched in Google and Eclipse web site but can't find any link. 

Do you know any site, ftp etc. to download bundle? 

Thanks.

A:The Android Developer pages still state how you can download and use the ADT plugin for Eclipse:


Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software.
Click Add, in the top-right corner.
In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter "ADT Plugin" for the Name and the following URL for the Location: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
Click OK.
In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Next.
In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click Next.
Read and accept the license agreements, then click Finish.
If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK
When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.




Links for the Eclipse ADT Bundle (found using Archive.org's WayBackMachine)
I don't know how future-proof these links are. They all worked on February 27th, 2017.

Update (2015-06-29): Google will end development and official support for ADT in Eclipse at the end of this year and recommends switching to Android Studio.
