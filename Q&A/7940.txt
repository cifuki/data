Q:I'm using this line below in order to set a strikethrough on my TextView:

tv.setPaintFlags(tv.getPaintFlags() | Paint.STRIKE_THRU_TEXT_FLAG);


However later on in the Fragment, if they click the TextView again, I would like the strikethrough to be removed. What line of code can I use to simply make the TextView display the text in the normal format again?

Thanks in advance!

A:I ended up finding this online:

tv.setPaintFlags(tv.getPaintFlags() & (~ Paint.STRIKE_THRU_TEXT_FLAG));


This successfully removes the strikethrough and therefore I called this in my OnListItemClick method after carrying out a check in the database I made to see if the item had already been striked through (purchased in my case).
