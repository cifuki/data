Q:What is a Window in Android?

I thought the top-most level in Android is called Activity, which is the screen you see.

Can someone tell me what a Window in Android is? do we just have one or multiple of them.

A:The Activity is what you would call a Window.

Technically speaking, the Activity creates the Window for you.

You can have many of them, but normally not synchronously. To ask for additional information you can call a Dialog, or fire an Intent to another Activity.
