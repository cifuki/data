A:Just go to "Run/edit configurations.../" and scroll down to bottom of the window and here you see an option "Before launch..." 
First, remove whatever already inside the little window and then click on (+) icon and select "Gradle-aware Make" and then type "assembleDebug" and select the first option or that you need. This will solve your problem.
