Q:I succeed in testing My GCM code.

But exactly same code, I couldn't get GCM push and got:


  GCM Error : Not Registered.

A:GCM response Not Registered means following "If it is NotRegistered, you should remove the registration ID from your server database because the application was uninstalled from the device or it does not have a broadcast receiver configured to receive com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE intents." from documentation. Check in what case you get this error, when app is uninstalled from the device or you describe incorrect broadcast receiver in AndroidManifest. You can test your GCM functionality with my test GCM server. Hope, this helps you.
