Q:As part of my app I'm using the NDK and was wondering if it's worth bundling x86 and mips binaries alongside the standard ARM binaries.

I figured the best way would be to track what my users actually have, is there an API call to grab the processor architecture so I can pass this back to my Google analytics instance?

Thanks

A:Actually, you can get the architecture without the need for reflexion at all:

String arch = System.getProperty("os.arch");


From my tests it returned armv71 and i686.

EDIT: 

On MIPS architecture, it either returns 'mips' or 'mips64'

On 64 bit ARM/Intel, it returns 'arch64' or 'x86_64' respectively.
