Q:ERROR MESSAGE:

jarsigner: Certificate chain not found for: project_foo.<br/>
project_foo must reference a valid KeyStore key entry containing a private key and corresponding public key certificate chain.


QUESTION:
How do I include a public key certificate chain to address the error?

BACKGROUND:
The App Developer has completed an Android app and delivered an unsigned APK called Foo.apk. My objective is to sign and zipalign the APK in preparation for uploading it to the Google Play store. My keystore is located at C:\\Path\\.keystore on a Windows machine.

COMMAND LINE, my command:

jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore C:\\Path\\\\.keystore Foo.apk project_foo


COMMAND LINE, response:

Enter Passphrase for keystore:
jarsigner: Certificate chain not found for: project_foo.<br/>
project_foo must reference a valid KeyStore key entry containing a private key and corresponding public key certificate chain.


ALSO TRIED:
Verified that I remember the correct password. Using 'keytool -list' from the command line shows me the expected list (it includes one private key).

PREVIOUS OS QUESTION: certificate chain not found asked using a .cer file from Verisign. I have no similar file available.

OTHER INFORMATION: Windows 7 machine, using standard Windows command prompt.

A:keytool -keystore formconnect.keystore -list -v

You can use this command to find out your alias name after you have generated your key.

First line of execution contains the Alias name: <value> If keytool is used then alias name might be "mykey".

Use that alias name while packaging the application.
