Q:In my activity I have some Rating bars. But the size of this bar is so big!
How can I make it smaller?

Edit

Thanks to Gabriel Negut, 
I did it with the following style:

<RatingBar
style = "?android:attr/ratingBarStyleSmall"
android:numStars = "5"
android:rating   = "4" />


Now, the size is reduced but number of stars and rating do not take effect!!!
Why? I have 7 stars that 6 of them is selected.

A:The original link I posted is now broken (there's a good reason why posting links only is not the best way to go). You have to style the RatingBar with either ratingBarStyleSmall or a custom style inheriting from Widget.Material.RatingBar.Small (assuming you're using Material Design in your app).

Option 1:

<RatingBar
    android:id="@+id/ratingBar"
    style="?android:attr/ratingBarStyleSmall"
    ... />


Option 2:

// styles.xml
<style name="customRatingBar"   
    parent="android:style/Widget.Material.RatingBar.Small">
    ... // Additional customizations
</style>

// layout.xml
<RatingBar
    android:id="@+id/ratingBar"
    style="@style/customRatingBar"
    ... />
