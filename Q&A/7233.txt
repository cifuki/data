Q:Explanation:
  
  I have a working app in google play market. Everything works fine in
  android versions from 4.0-7.0.
  
  Case:
  
  When the client downloaded it on his Android 8.0 (Oreo) a launcher
  icon did not seem to show instead android's default launcher icon is
  showing!!
  
  Question:
  
  Anyone who has encountered such issue? I need any hints to solve it since it seems weird because I have all 4 typed .png icons in mipmap folder.
