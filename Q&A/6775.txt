Q:What is the difference between the following statements when issued from a Android Studio Project's terminal :


  Android_Studio_Project_Path: ./gradlew clean
  
  Android_Studio_Project_Path: ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
  
  Android_Studio_Project_Path: ./gradlew clean :assembleDebug 
  
  and normal Android Studio --> Build --> Clean.


What would be the difference in the internal process.

A:./gradlew clean

Uses your project's gradle wrapper to execute your project's clean task.  Usually, this just means the deletion of the build directory.
./gradlew clean assembleDebug

Again, uses your project's gradle wrapper to execute the clean and assembleDebug tasks, respectively.  So, it will clean first, then execute assembleDebug, after any non-up-to-date dependent tasks.
./gradlew clean :assembleDebug

Is essentially the same as #2.  The colon represents the task path.  Task paths are essential in gradle multi-project's, not so much in this context.  It means run the root project's assembleDebug task.  Here, the root project is the only project.
Android Studio --> Build --> Clean

Is essentially the same as ./gradlew clean.  See here.


For more info, I suggest taking the time to read through the Android docs, especially this one.
