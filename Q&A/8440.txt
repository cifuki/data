Q:I'm completely stumped on this one.  I have three different lists that need to be displayed on the screen. It's completely possible that the lists will extend past the bottom edge of the screen, so I would need scrolling.

I've tried using a ScrollView with a LinearLayout child, and putting my ListViews in the LinearView, but all of the ListViews lock to a fixed height with scroll bars.  Using other kinds of Layouts means no scrolling.

Does anyone have any suggestions, or will I need to programmatically add the list items to some layout and hope for the best?

A:I haven't done this yet, but I've been thinking about it since I'll probably need to do it. I can think of three options: use only one list with the contents of all lists. You can make a ListAdapter that does that and inserts some kind of header. This could probably be something very re-usable.

The other idea is to make a list of lists. But that sounds like asking for trouble.
