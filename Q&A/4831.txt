Q:I have an issue with Palette -> Text
When I want to set some view, I receive a message problem "Missing autofillHints attribute"
Any suggestions?

A:Perhaps you are using an EditText. autofillHints is used in API 26 and above for filling empty EditTexts and it's actually suggesting which type of content should be placed in there.

Just add :

android:autofillHints="username" // the type of content you want


To your EditText and warning will disappear. 


  You do this using the new android:autofillHints attribute to tell
  autofill what type of content you expect, and
  android:importantForAutofill to tell autofill which views you want (or
  do not want) to be filled.

Edit:

You can however set:

android:importantForAutofill="no"


To the component to tell it is not important to fill and get rid of the error.
