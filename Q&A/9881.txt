Q:I have downloaded latest ActionBarSherlock and trying to open it in Eclipse.



After pressing Finish button nothing happens.
No errors.
All buttons work as if I have not pressed Finish button. I can return Back or Refresh or check checkbox. 

My path has no spaces.

ActionCarSherlock requires ADT version 0.9.7 but I have found following version of software in eclipse.

Android Development Tools 21.1.0.v201302060044-569685 com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.feature.group   The Android Open Source Project

PS Eclipse update has not helped me (updating SDK)

PS Android SDK update fixed it

A:I came across this problem yesterday.

I had recently updated the ADT plugin without updating the Android SDK Tools and Platform-tools.

So make sure all of the above are up-to-date.
