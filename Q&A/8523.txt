Q:public class ListView extends  ListActivity {

static String item;

public void onCreate(Bundle icicle) {
            super.onCreate(icicle);

            ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this,
                android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, Str.S);
            setListAdapter(adapter);

      }


This is my list view class which works nice and it takes the strings from a class called Str and display them in a listview, the problem is the listview style isn't nice, it's black with the strings in white.

I want them to be alternative each row has a color.

I tried many tutorials but none was clear enough .. 
How do I make Alternative Color for each row .. ex. row1 Blue, row 2 White, row 3 Blue, row 4 White, etc..

A:Here is how to do that.

My example code is given here in brief:

Override the getView method in your adapter:

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {  
View view = super.getView(position, convertView, parent);  
if (position % 2 == 1) {
    view.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE);  
} else {
    view.setBackgroundColor(Color.CYAN);  
}

return view;  
}


Override ArrayAdapter and override getView method there.

So if your adapter is something like this:

public class MyAdapter extends ArrayAdapter


Your ListActivity will change like this:

 ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new MyAdapter<String>(this,
                android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, Str.S);


Here's an example about overriding ArrayAdapter.
