Q:I usually tend to define the model layer of my apps using POJO's, such as Article, Comment, etc.

I was about to implement an AlphabetIndexer in the adapter of one of my ListViews. Right now this adapter accepts a Collection of Articles, which I normally get from my wrapper around an SQLiteDatabase.

The signature of the AlphabetIndexer constructer is as follows:

public AlphabetIndexer (Cursor cursor, int sortedColumnIndex, CharSequence alphabet)


Since this doesn't accept a Collection or something similar, just a Cursor, it got me wondering: maybe I shouldn't be creating objects for my model, and just use the Cursors returned from the database?

So the question is, I guess: what should I do, represent data with Collections of POJO's, or just work with Cursors throughout my app?

Any input?

A:I have run into similar issues. Right now, I am tending away from POJOs. Note, though, that you can create your own Cursor interface for a collection of POJOs, if you so choose.
