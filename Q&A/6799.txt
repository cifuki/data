Q:Is there an Intent to go to my Application's "App Permissions" screen in Android-M?

I am making my App ready for Android-M and with the new permissions model. I have followed all the steps mentioned in the link

https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html

Everything is set and all is good accept that if the user has checked the "Never ask again" button and denied permission, on next launch I want to give the user an option to go to the Application's "App Permissions" and change the permission himself, if he ever changes his mind. I wanted to make it a bit easier for the non-tech savvy user by providing a button which would take the user straight to my application's "App Permissions" screen. Is there a way? (It would be much better than giving the user instructions like Menu → Settings → Applications → Manage Applications → select application)

Thank you for helping out!

A:No, there is no intent to go directly to the Permissions screen.

However, just as in previous versions of Android, you can point people to your application's detail setting page using code such as:

Intent intent = new Intent(Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS,
    Uri.fromParts("package", getPackageName(), null));
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
startActivity(intent);


This will allow them to only hit a single button (the Permissions button on that screen) before they can access permissions.

Note that as per the UX around asking for permissions, consider linking to the settings page only as a last resort and only in cases where the permission is necessary for your app to function at all - ideally, you should show a strong rationale when shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() returns true (i.e., they've denied it once but have not hit 'never ask again') such that the second time the user sees a permission dialog they know exactly why you need that permission. This means that users hitting 'never ask again' should be considered a very strong signal that the user will not ever grant you that permission.
