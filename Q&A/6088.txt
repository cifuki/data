Q:Why does this happen? It doesn't matter which package I pick, always the same error message:

Downloading Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 3
Failed to create directory C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-sdk\\temp

A:Make sure you have writing permissions for that folder. Try starting Eclipse or the SDK Manager as Administrator.
