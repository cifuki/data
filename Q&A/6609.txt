A:I am aware of these limitations:


Pre-installed software. Real device can have preinstalled a lot more applications than emulator.
You cannot use "capture" photo/video functions in emulator.


According to emulator documentation, its limitations are:

The functional limitations of the emulator include:


No support for placing or receiving actual phone calls. You can
simulate phone calls (placed and received) through the emulator
console, however.
No support for USB connections
No support for device-attached headphones
No support for determining network connected state
No support for determining battery charge level and AC charging state
No support for determining SD card insert/eject
No support for Bluetooth


IMO you can use emulator to simplify UI development, to view UI on "device screen", to be sure that app layout is ok, app can be run, you can test some special cases by simulating gps position, network speed or messaging etc. But testing on real device is a must.
