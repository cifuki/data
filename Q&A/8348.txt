Q:Launching the first test version of my android app, I have followed instructions on creating a google group. Then I return to the Play page where to specify the group. But when I copy and paste my group name and click Add, I get the message of Group not found. Does anyone have some advice/guidance on how to successfully create a group of alpha testers?

A:I found the fix. Instead of just pasting the group name, you have to type the group's email address completely including the @googlegroups.com part. So if your group's name is myfriends then you must type myfriends@googlegroups.com in the box.
