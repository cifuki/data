Q:I'm looking for a way to scroll a RecyclerView to show the selected item on top.

In a ListView I was able to do that by using scrollTo(x,y) and getting the top of the element that need to be centered.

Something like:

@Override
public void onItemClick(View v, int pos){
    mylistView.scrollTo(0, v.getTop());
}


The problem is that the RecyclerView returns an error when using it's scrollTo method saying 


  RecyclerView does not support scrolling to an absolute position


How can I scroll a RecyclerView to put the selected item at the top of the view?

A:If you are using the LinearLayoutManager or Staggered GridLayoutManager, they each have a scrollToPositionWithOffset method that takes both the position and also the offset of the start of the item from the start of the RecyclerView, which seems like it would accomplish what you need (setting the offset to 0 should align with the top).

For instance:

//Scroll item 2 to 20 pixels from the top
linearLayoutManager.scrollToPositionWithOffset(2, 20);
