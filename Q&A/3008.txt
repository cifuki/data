Q:I am new to Android development. I am setting up development environment. 
So my question is, what is Intel x86 atom system image in Android SDK manager? 
Should i install it or not?
The option is present in API level 15 & 16 but not in 17.

Thanks.

It is a version of the Android emulator that runs natively on x86 CPUs, like those in most development machines.

Contrast that with the ARM system image, which contains ARM (not x86) CPU instructions, and therefore must be translated when run.


  Should i install it or not?


The x86 emulator images, where available, tend to run faster. You will have to do some work on your development machine to take advantage of them, as is outlined in the documentation.

AFAIK Google relies upon Intel to create these images, and Intel has only done so on a few API levels.
