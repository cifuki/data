Q:DataBinding Guide States

  By default, a Binding class will be generated based on the name of the layout 
file, converting it to Pascal case and suffixing \xe2\x80\x9cBinding\xe2\x80\x9d to it. 
The above layout file was activity_main.xml so the generate class was ActivityMainBinding.


When will the Binding class , here say ActivityMainBinding, will be generated. I have compile time error. "cannot resolve ActivityMainBinding".

ActivityMainBinding binding = DataBindingUtil.setContentView(this, R.layout.main_activity);


Any help is appreciated. Thanks

A:What is your layout name?  


  The above layout file was activity_main.xml so the generate class was ActivityMainBinding. 


What this means is that the generated class name will depend on your layout's name 
activity_main.xml -> ActivityMainBinding.java

I think your activity name is "main_activity", so the generated binding class name should be MainActivityBinding not ActivityMainBinding
