Q:So I am trying to create an observable which fires on a regular basis, but for some reason which I cannot figure out, it only fires once. Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?

Observable<Long> observable = Observable.timer(delay, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io());

        subscription =  observable
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(new Action1<Long>() {
                    @Override
                    public void call(Long aLong) {
                        searchByStockHelper.requestRemoteSearchByStock();
                    }
                });


currently delay is set to 2

A:The documentation for the timer operator says this:


  Create an Observable that emits a particular item after a given delay


Thus the behavior you are observing is expected- timer() emits just a single item after a delay.

The interval operator, on the other hand, will emit items spaced out with a given interval.

For example, this Observable will emit an item every second:

Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
