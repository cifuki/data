Q:I want to finish one activity from another activity, like:

In Activity [A], on button click, I am calling Activity [B] without finishing Activity [A].

Now in Activity [B], there are two buttons, New and Modify. When the user clicks on modify then pop an activity [A] from the stack with all the options ticked..

But when the user click on New button from Activity [B], then I will have to finish Activity [A] from the stack and reload that Activity [A] again into the stack.

I am trying it, but I am not able to finish Activity [A] from the stack... How can I do it?

I am using the code as:

From Activity [A]:

Intent GotoB = new Intent(A.this,B.class);
startActivityForResult(GotoB,1);


Another method in same activity

public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {

    if (requestCode == 1)
    {
        if (resultCode == 1) {
            Intent i = getIntent();
            overridePendingTransition(0, 0);
            i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
            finish();

            overridePendingTransition(0, 0);
            startActivity(i);
        }
    }
}


And in Activity [B], on button click:

setResult(1);
finish();

A:Make your activity A in manifest file: launchMode = "singleInstance"
When the user clicks new, do FirstActivity.fa.finish(); and call the new Intent.
When the user clicks modify, call the new Intent or simply finish activity B.


FIRST WAY

In your first activity, declare one Activity object like this,

public static Activity fa;
onCreate()
{
    fa = this;
}


now use that object in another Activity to finish first-activity like this,

onCreate()
{
    FirstActivity.fa.finish();
}


SECOND WAY

While calling your activity FirstActivity which you want to finish as soon as you move on,
You can add flag while calling FirstActivity

intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY);


But using this flag the activity will get finished evenif you want it not to. and sometime onBack if you want to show the FirstActivity you will have to call it using intent.
