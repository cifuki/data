Q:I have a layout defined in XML. It contains also: 

<RelativeLayout
    android:id="@+id/item"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
/>


I would like to inflate this RelativeView with other XML layout file. I may use different layouts depending on a situation. How should I do it? I was trying different variations of 

RelativeLayout item = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.item);
item.inflate(...)


But none of them worked fine.

A:I'm not sure I have followed your question- are you trying to attach a child view to the RelativeLayout? If so you want to do something along the lines of:

RelativeLayout item = (RelativeLayout)findViewById(R.id.item);
View child = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.child, null);
item.addView(child);
