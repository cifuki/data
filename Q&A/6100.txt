Q:Today I installed API8 from the SDK manager, previously I only had been working with API14. After the SDK manager was done, and upon restarting ADT I got this error:


  This android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 21.1.0
  and above. Current version is 21.0.1.2012-12-6-2-58.


So I click to find updates but I get "no updates found".

I did the following:


Used the SDK manager to re-install android SDK tools (rev 21.1).
Used the SDK manager to re-install API8 and API14.


Still no go :(

A:I had the same issue. Please try the following in eclipse

Help --> Install new software

Then choose "Android Developer Tools Update Site - http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/" from the drop down list and update the ADT

IF THIS THROWS ERROR Like this 

No repository found containing: osgi.bundle,com.android.ide.eclipse.adt,21.1.0.v201302060044-569685

Modify http: to https:

Sample : https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

And then update ADT. This method worked for me.
