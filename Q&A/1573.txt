Q:The default Browser app for Android shows zoom controls when you're scrolling and also allows for pinch zooming. How can I enable this feature for my own Webview?

I've tried: 

webSettings.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);
webSettings.setSupportZoom(true);


but neither of the features get enabled as a result. Btw I've set a WebChromeClient and a WebViewClient for the Webview if that makes a difference. 

Thanks!

A:Strange. Inside OnCreate method, I'm using

webView.getSettings().setBuiltInZoomControls(true);


And it's working fine here.
Anything particular in your webview ?
