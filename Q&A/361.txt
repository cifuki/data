Q:I'm adding TextViews programmatically in a for-loop and add them to an ArrayList.

How do I use TextView.setId(int id)? What Integer ID do I come up with so it doesn't conflict with other IDs?

A:According to View documentation 


  The identifier does not have to be unique in this view's hierarchy. The identifier should be a positive number.


So you can use any positive integer you like, but in this case there can be some views with equivalent id's. If you want to search for some view in hierarchy calling to setTag with some key objects may be handy.
