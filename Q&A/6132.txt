Q:I recently uploaded my application to the android market however it's refusing to run when downloaded due to the error


  Package file was not signed correctly


I first published the packet using eclipse, right click export, creating a keystore then publishing, however it refuses to work.

I then downloaded the keytool and jarsigner and used them to sign an upgrade which I posted instead. However this gives the same error.

I have no idea what I've done wrong, and since I cannot delete the application I cannot try and start again can anyone help me?

Thanks

A:You have your debug copy still installed on your device most likely.  Now you have downloaded a different copy of the same app and it's causing this error.

Uninstall the app completely from your device.  Then download it from the market again and it should work.
