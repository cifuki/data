Q:While trying to get Robolectric RC3 to work in Android Studio, I get

Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: build/intermediates/bundles/debug/AndroidManifest.xml not found or not a file; it should point to your project's AndroidManifest.xml
at org.robolectric.manifest.AndroidManifest.validate(AndroidManifest.java:120)
at org.robolectric.manifest.AndroidManifest.getResourcePath(AndroidManifest.java:469)

at org.robolectric.RobolectricTestRunner.setUpApplicationState(RobolectricTestRunner.java:421)
at org.robolectric.RobolectricTestRunner$2.evaluate(RobolectricTestRunner.java:234)


I tried 

@Config(manifest = "app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml", constants = BuildConfig.class, sdk=21)


and I tried setting the manifest location in my TestRunner, nothing worked. In the file system I see that the manifest is in 

./app/build/intermediates/manifests/full/debug/AndroidManifest.xml


not in the location Robolectric is looking for it. 
At one point the manifest just got ignored, then a similar issue occurred for resources, the app or Robolectric couldn't find a raw resource my app uses. 
This is in my build file:

   sourceSets {
    main {
        java.srcDirs = ['src/main/java']
        resources.srcDirs = ['src/main/res']
    }
    test {
        java.srcDirs = ['src/test/java', 'src/main/java']
        resources.srcDirs = ['src/test/res', 'src/main/res']
    }
}


How do I tell Robolectric where to look for a manifest, and more importantly, where to look for resources?

Edit:
I have checked out Robolectric from github, I've built it, installed it in my local .m2 repo, the gradle file now refers to the local SNAPSHOT build, and I made sure Gradle doesn't get a new version from a remote repo. Then I copied the RobolectricGradleTestRunner to my project, I have changed the lines where the file locations are defined: it didn't contain the module name. Now it works.

A:I'm assuming you're trying to run the tests with JUnit. You can try two different things:


Create a Custom TestRunner class, as shown here. Check the CustomTestRunner section, where you basically create a TestRunner that actually knows the right manifest to use. Specify your tests for them to run with your test runner, with the @Config annotation.
(My preferred choice) Go the your JUnit configuration, Run > Edit Configurations. Notice the 'Working Directory' textbox. Append /app (for OSX and Linux) or \\app (Windows), to the path written in the textbox. Try running again and it should work.
