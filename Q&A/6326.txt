Q:I just updated Google play services to the latest release - 23 - in the Android SDK Manager. Next I updated dependency in my project to:
com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:8.3.0

But I got:

Found com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:8.3.0, but version 8.1.0 is needed
Found com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:8.3.0, but version 8.1.0 is needed

What is wrong? Do you have this problem also?

A:In your top-level build.gradle file you need to update the dependencies to use

classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.5.0-beta2'


Extra Info:
The latest version of this can be found by looking at the entry on JFrog Bintray

Further Update:
Yes this has been updated since I answered the question.  The latest version is:

classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'


However, it's always worth following the provided link to find the latest version.
