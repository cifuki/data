Q:I have code like this 

public static class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
    @InjectView(R.id.text)
    TextView label;

    public MyViewHolder(View itemView) {
        super(itemView);
        ButterKnife.inject(this, itemView);
    }

    public void hide(boolean hide) {
        label.setVisibility(hide ? View.GONE : View.VISIBLE);
    }
}


which maps to a single row in a RecyclerView. R.id.text is in fact the root view of the layout that gets inflated and passed in to the constructor here. 

I'm using the default implementation of LinearLayoutManager.

In bindViewHolder, I call hide(true) on an instance of MyViewHolder, but instead of collapsing the row as expected, the row becomes invisible, maintaining its height and position in the RecyclerView. Has anyone else run into this issue? 

How do you hide items in a RecyclerView?

A:There is no built in way to hide a child in RV but of course if its height becomes 0, it won't be visible :). I assume your root layout does have some min height (or exact height) that makes it still take space even though it is GONE.

Also, if you want to remove a view, remove it from the adapter, don't hide it. Is there a reason why you want to hide instead of remove ?
