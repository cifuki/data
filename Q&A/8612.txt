Q:I have 10-15 activities in my project. I want to have the option menu mostly in all Activities. Then is their any way we can do it at one place and it appears in all activities.

Also, I will like to hide the option menu in some. So, is it possible or I have to write option menu code in all activities.

Regards

A:Create a Class (say BaseActivity) that extends Activity, and override onCreateOptionsMenu and onOptionsItemSelected functions.

public class BaseActivity extends Activity {

    // Activity code here

    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater();
        inflater.inflate(R.menu.options_menu, menu);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        switch (item.getItemId()) {
            case R.id.item:
                // do what you want here
                return true;
            default:
               return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
        }
    }
}


Now, in the other 15-16 activities, instead of extending an Activity, you should extend BaseActivity.

public class FooActivity extends BaseActivity { 

    // Activity code here

}


This way, all your activities derive the options menu. For activities where you want the options menu disabled, you can override it again in that particular activity.

public class BarActivity extends BaseActivity { 

    // Activity code here

   @Override
   public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
       // Do Nothing
   }

   @Override
   public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
       // Do Nothing
   }
}


Hopefully, it doesn't give you problems in the manifest file.
