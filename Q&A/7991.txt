Q:I want to play an audio file based on the click of a button. I have defined the onClickListener() method and the layout file. When I add the wav files to the res/ directory, I get the following build error:


  invalid resource directory name   temp.wav /hello/res line 1  Android AAPT Problem


My question is as follows:
1. What directory do I need to store audio files in? Currently they are in the res/ folder.
2. Also, mp.setDataSource("/res/temp.wav") the correct way to invoke the media player?

A:dont put the media files inside res/  

Put your files(temp.wav) in a folder named /sdcard/audio(if you are using an emulator).  

and do this : 

mp.setDataSource("/sdcard/audio/temp.wav");
