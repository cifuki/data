Q:After upgrading to OS X Yosemite I found that eclipse was not working because JAVA was not properly installed. I installed it and now I am able to open eclipse. 

When I connect my device, I am able to see my device on the device list in eclipse. However when I run my project, I am unable to see it on Android device chooser. My device is getting detected by Eclipse but I am not able to select it to run.

This was working perfectly on my previous OS X Mavericks! Please help!

Thanks

A:It seems to be a layout bug. 

Drag one of the column headers in the device chooser where the device should be and change the column width and it magically appears!



You can also double click the device's row even when it's hidden, so you don't have to resize the column each time.
