Q:Is there a way when using Cordova CLI to select a particular emulated device from the Android Device Manager (AVD)?

I am working on a tablet app and a smartphone app at the same time and need to switch to different types of emulators because of the different form factors and screen resolutions?

I know it's not a particular coding question but perhaps there is some Cordova code I can run in terminal to make the emulation more specific rather than:

cordova emulate android


Which seems to pick the first emulator off the stack.

A:Use the target parameter like this:

cordova emulate --target=emulator-5554 android


To get the device name of your emulator ("emulator-5554" in this example), run /platforms/android/cordova/lib/list-started-emulators.bat
